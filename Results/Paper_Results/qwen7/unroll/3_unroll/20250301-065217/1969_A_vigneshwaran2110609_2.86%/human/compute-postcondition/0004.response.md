Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list `p` of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of `t`, `n`, and `p` values, and it processes these inputs according to the specified constraints, returning appropriate results for each case.
