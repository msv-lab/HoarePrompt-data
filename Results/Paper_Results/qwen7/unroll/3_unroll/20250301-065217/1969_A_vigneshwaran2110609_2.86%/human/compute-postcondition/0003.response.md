Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After executing the loop, the output consists of either "2" printed for each iteration where the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met, or "3" printed for each iteration where the condition is not met.

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state, but with the addition of printed outputs from the loop. For each iteration of the loop, if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is true, the number 2 is printed; otherwise, the number 3 is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `p` remain unchanged.
