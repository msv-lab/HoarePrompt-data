Reasoning:
- The function `func()` correctly processes the input as per the problem statement.
- It reads the number of test cases `w`, and for each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and their lengths stored in `palka`.
- It then creates a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length and a list `pl` to store unique stick lengths.
- The function iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl` and calculates how many complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) can be formed using the sticks of that length by dividing the count of each length by 3 (since a polygon needs at least 3 sides).
- The total number of polygons is calculated by summing up the results for each unique stick length.
- The function then prints the total number of polygons for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
