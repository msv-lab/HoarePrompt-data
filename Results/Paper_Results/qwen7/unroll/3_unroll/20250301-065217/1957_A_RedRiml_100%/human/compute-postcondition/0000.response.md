Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `w` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 is still valid.
