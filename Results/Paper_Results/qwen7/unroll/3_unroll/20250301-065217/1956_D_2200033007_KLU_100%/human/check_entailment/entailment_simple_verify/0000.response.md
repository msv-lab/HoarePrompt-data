### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function appears to be a recursive function that computes some value related to the subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`. However, the logic inside the function is not clear and does not seem to directly relate to the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements by setting subarrays to the MEX value of those subarrays. The function uses recursion and memoization (`res_dict`) but the purpose of the calculations is unclear.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function is supposed to find the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. It calls `func_1` to get the maximum possible sum for a given subarray. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not seem to correctly identify the optimal operations to set subarrays to their MEX values. The function checks if the maximum value equals the square of the length of the subarray, which is not relevant to the problem. It then tries to split the subarray into smaller subarrays and recursively finds the operations, but it does not ensure that the MEX value is correctly applied.

#### Function `make_stairs`:
This function is intended to create a staircase pattern in the array, where each element in a subarray is set to the index of that element. This is a step towards achieving the maximum sum, but it does not correctly handle the MEX value operation. The function does not ensure that the MEX value is used to update the subarray.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not align with the problem requirements and do not produce the correct output format.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It does not use the allowed operations to maximize the sum of the array elements, and it does not produce the required output format.
