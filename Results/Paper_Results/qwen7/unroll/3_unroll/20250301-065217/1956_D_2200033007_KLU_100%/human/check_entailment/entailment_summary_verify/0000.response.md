### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it against the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX of that subarray. The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function computes a value based on a recursive approach, likely related to some form of dynamic programming. However, the function does not seem to directly relate to the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the MEX operation.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is supposed to find the sequence of operations that maximizes the sum of the array elements. It uses the result from `func_1` to determine the optimal operations. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not clearly align with the problem's requirements.
- **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**: This function is responsible for modifying the array `arr` and appending operations to the list `res`. It checks if the current segment of the array already forms a staircase pattern (where each element is the index of its position). If not, it modifies the array to form a staircase pattern starting from the current index.

Given these observations, let's break down the issues:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The function seems to be computing some value recursively, but it does not directly involve the MEX operation or the array modification needed to maximize the sum.
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to find the optimal sequence of operations. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not clearly reflect the MEX operation or the process of setting subarrays to their MEX values.
3. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**: This function tries to create a staircase pattern in the array, which is a step towards maximizing the sum, but it does not fully address the problem since it does not handle the general case where the MEX value needs to be determined dynamically.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
To achieve this, we need to:
1. Set the subarray `[2, 1]` to the MEX value of this subarray, which is `0`. This results in the array `[1, 100, 0, 0]`.
2. Set the subarray `[0, 0]` to the MEX value of this subarray, which is `1`. This results in the array `[1, 100, 1, 1]`.

The provided program does not correctly implement these steps. Specifically:
- `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly compute the MEX values or the optimal operations.
- `make_stairs` does not handle the general case of finding the MEX value and setting the subarray accordingly.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not address the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. They do not return the required output format, which includes the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
