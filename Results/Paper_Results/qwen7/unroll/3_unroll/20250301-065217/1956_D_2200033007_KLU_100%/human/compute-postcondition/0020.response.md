Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and all elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` either match their indices or a mismatch was found during the iteration. Additionally, the element at `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `res.append((start_index, start_index + i))` appends a tuple containing `start_index` and `start_index + i` to the list `res`. The values of `is_already_stairs` and the conditions about the slice of `arr` remain unchanged.
