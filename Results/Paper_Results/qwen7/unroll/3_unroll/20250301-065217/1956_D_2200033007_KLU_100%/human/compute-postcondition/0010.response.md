Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` remains unchanged, `start_index` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `res` is now a list containing the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `arr[start_index]` is set to 1.**

This means that the value at `arr[start_index]` has been changed to 1, while all other variables remain in their initial states.
