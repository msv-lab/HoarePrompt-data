State: **`is_already_stairs` is True, `j` is 0, `i` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `j` and `i`.
- The loop `for j in range(i + 1):` will start executing if `i + 1` is at least 1, meaning `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- Since `j` starts from 0 by default when using `range(i + 1)`, we can assume `j` is 0 at the start of the loop.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
