You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: Output State: `tt` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4. For each `ii` in the range of `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from user input, and `a` is a list of integers also obtained from user input. After processing through the loop, `ans` is calculated based on the given logic and printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n-2`. The final value of `ans` after all iterations is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions involving these inputs and the sequence of integers. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `n-2` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of `x` chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This accounts for the minimum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices plus any additional vertices.
   
3. **Checking Adjacent Vertices**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices `a` to check pairs of adjacent vertices.
   - If the difference between two consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it means there is an unchosen vertex between them, allowing an additional triangle to be formed. Hence, `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates how many additional triangles can be formed by dividing the difference by 2 and adds these to `tmp`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program checks the difference between the first and last chosen vertices, considering the circular nature of the polygon. If this difference is 2 or even, it adds to `tmp`.

5. **Optimizing Additional Triangles**:
   - The program sorts `tmp` and tries to maximize the number of additional triangles by using the largest gaps first.
   - It iterates through `tmp` and uses up to `y` additional vertices to form triangles, updating `ans` accordingly and decrementing `y`.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The final answer is adjusted to be at most `n - 2`, ensuring that the number of triangles does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in a polygon.

### Analysis:
The logic in the program seems sound and follows the steps required to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, and the approach to maximize the number of triangles is logically consistent.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
