Reasoning:

The provided program `func()` does not match the problem description at all. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates specific files in directories based on certain criteria related to HTML files and their names. However, the given `func()` function is completely different; it reads input from the user and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the count of '1's in a string. 

Since the given function `func()` does not implement the logic required by the problem description, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
