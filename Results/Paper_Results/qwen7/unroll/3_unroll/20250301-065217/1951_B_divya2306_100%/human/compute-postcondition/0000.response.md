Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers.**

In this output state, the variable `t` retains its original range constraint, while `n` and `k` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input split operation. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the given code snippet.
