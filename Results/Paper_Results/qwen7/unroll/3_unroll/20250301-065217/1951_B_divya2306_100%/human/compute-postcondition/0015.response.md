Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of variables (t, n, k, a) where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n and k are integers within specified ranges, and a is a list of n distinct integers. It returns the current value of wins, which is greater than or equal to k.**
