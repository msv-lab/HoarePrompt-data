Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The first condition checks if `x < k - 1`. This is handled correctly, and the logic for determining if Sasha can achieve the goal is sound.
   - The second condition checks if `x == k - 1`. This is also handled correctly, and the logic is appropriate.
   - The third condition uses a loop to calculate `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can achieve the goal. The formula used in the loop is correct and ensures that Sasha can cover all possible sequences of wins and losses up to `x` consecutive losses.
3. **Output Logic**: The function prints 'YES' if Sasha can achieve the goal and 'NO' otherwise. The logic inside the loops and conditional statements is consistent with the problem statement.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately, such as when `x < k - 1` or `x == k - 1`, and calculates the required number of coins (`z`) correctly using the loop.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
