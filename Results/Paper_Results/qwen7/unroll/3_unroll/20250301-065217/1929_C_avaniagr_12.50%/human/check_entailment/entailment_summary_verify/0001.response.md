### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks the conditions for `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`:
       - It checks if `a >= x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`:
       - It calculates `z` using a loop where `z` is incremented based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
       - It checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - For `x < k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times in a row, plus one additional bet to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can always bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again.
   - For `x == k - 1`:
     - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `k - 1` times in a row and then winning twice to recover.
     - This logic is correct because Sasha can bet 1 coin after a loss until he wins again, and the recovery is possible within the constraints.
   - For `x > k - 1`:
     - The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then recovering.
     - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` correctly models the growth of Sasha's coins after each loss and subsequent win.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is less than `k - 1` and `x` equals `k - 1` correctly.
   - The loop for `x > k - 1` correctly calculates the required number of coins `z` to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the logic for `x > k - 1` might not be entirely correct. Specifically, the loop for calculating `z` might not accurately model the worst-case scenario for all values of `x`.

### Detailed Analysis of `x > k - 1`

For `x > k - 1`, the program calculates `z` as follows:
```python
z = 0
for i in range(x + 1):
    z += z // (k - 1) + 1
```
This loop is intended to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to recover from losing `x` times in a row. However, the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` might not correctly model the worst-case scenario for all values of `x`.

### Counterexample

Consider the case where `k = 2`, `x = 3`, and `a = 1`:
- According to the problem, Sasha can lose up to 3 times in a row.
- The worst-case scenario would be losing 3 times in a row, which means Sasha needs to recover from losing 3 times.
- The correct number of coins needed to recover from losing 3 times is `2^3 = 8` coins (since each loss multiplies the required coins by `k - 1`).

However, the program calculates `z` as follows:
```python
z = 0
for i in range(4):  # x + 1 = 4
    z += z // 1 + 1  # k - 1 = 1
```
This results in `z = 4`, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach

To correctly model the worst-case scenario for `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to recover from losing `x` times in a row. The correct formula is:
\[ z = (k - 1)^{x} \]

### Revised Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = (k - 1) ** x
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation

Given the revised logic, the original assessment was inaccurate due to the incorrect calculation of `z` for `x > k - 1`.

Final: **False**
