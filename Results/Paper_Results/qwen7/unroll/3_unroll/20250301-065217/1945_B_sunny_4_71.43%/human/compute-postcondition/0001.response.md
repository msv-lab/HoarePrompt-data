Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`.
   - `_` is a placeholder variable used in the loop, but its specific name doesn't matter for the adjustment since it's not referenced in the loop body.
   - `t` is the variable that determines how many times the loop will execute.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `t` is set to the integer value entered by the user.

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is set to a user-entered value, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**.
