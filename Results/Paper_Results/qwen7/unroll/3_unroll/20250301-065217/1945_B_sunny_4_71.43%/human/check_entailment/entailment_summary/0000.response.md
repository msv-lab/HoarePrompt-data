Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at any given time. However, the logic used to determine the number of fireworks visible simultaneously is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates \(A\) and \(B\) as the number of fireworks launched by the first and second installations within the visibility period \(m\), respectively. This approach does not account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from different installations.

To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be the number of multiples of \(a\) and \(b\) that fit into the visibility period \(m\), plus one additional firework from each installation that overlaps at the LCM interval.

However, the provided solution does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it simply sums the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period, which does not account for the overlap and simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations.

Given the flaw in the logic, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
