### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the intervals during which fireworks from both installations overlap in visibility.
   - The key observation is that the number of fireworks visible from each installation over a period of `m` minutes is approximately `m / a` and `m / b`, respectively. Adding 1 accounts for the inclusion of the initial launch time.

3. **Calculation:**
   - For the first installation, the number of fireworks visible within `m` minutes is `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - For the second installation, the number of fireworks visible within `m` minutes is `int(m / b) + 1`.

4. **Overlap Consideration:**
   - The formula provided in the code directly sums these values without considering any overlap between the two installations. However, the problem statement does not specify any specific constraints or overlaps beyond the visibility period. Therefore, the provided solution is a reasonable approximation under the assumption that the overlaps do not significantly affect the count.

5. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks from each installation using the given formulas.
   - It sums these values and prints the result.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles large values of `a`, `b`, and `m` within the given constraints (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18).
   - The logic is straightforward and does not require complex calculations or additional checks for overlap beyond the visibility period.

However, there is a critical flaw in the approach. The calculation `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` only considers the number of fireworks launched within the visibility period `m` and does not account for the possibility of simultaneous launches that extend beyond the initial `m` minutes but still overlap within the visibility period.

For example, consider the test case:
- \(a = 6\)
- \(b = 7\)
- \(m = 4\)

- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 6, 12, 18, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 0, 7, 14, 21, ...

Within the first 4 minutes, the only simultaneous launch is at time 0. The code would calculate:
- \(A = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{6} \right\rfloor + 1 = 1\)
- \(B = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{7} \right\rfloor + 1 = 1\)

Summing these gives \(A + B = 2\), which is correct for this specific interval. However, the actual maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2, as both installations have fireworks visible at time 0 and potentially at other overlapping times within the extended visibility period.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not fully account for the potential overlaps that extend beyond the initial visibility period `m`. Therefore, the solution is not entirely correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
