Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m for each test case, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns the result based on the values of t, a, and m.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers: t, a, and m. For each test case, the function will process these integers according to their specified ranges and return a result based on these values.
