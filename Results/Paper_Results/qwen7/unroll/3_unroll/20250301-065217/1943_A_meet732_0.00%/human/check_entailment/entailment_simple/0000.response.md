Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes a counter list `cntl` to count occurrences of each number in `a`.
4. It then counts the occurrences of each number in `a` using the `cntl` list.
5. The logic to determine the MEX value is as follows:
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, the MEX is 0 because 0 is missing.
   - Otherwise, the MEX is determined by checking the smallest number that appears fewer than twice in the array.
6. The program correctly handles the case where `cntl[0]` is zero by printing 0 immediately.
7. For other cases, the program calculates the MEX by iterating through the `cntl` list and decrementing `c` until it reaches 0 or the end of the list is reached.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the program matches the requirements and correctly computes the MEX value under optimal play conditions.

Correctness: **True**
