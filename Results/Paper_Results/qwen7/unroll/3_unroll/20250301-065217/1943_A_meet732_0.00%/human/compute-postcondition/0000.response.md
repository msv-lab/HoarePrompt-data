Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range of input values.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't carry any specific value into the loop. However, the loop will execute based on the number of times `int(input())` evaluates to a positive integer. 

3. **Consider the given constraints**: The constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4` tells us that `t` (which is the result of `int(input())`) must be within this range for the loop to execute. 

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` results in a value within the specified range for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the input to `int(input())` is within the valid range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

Since `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case involves reading `n` and `a`, the loop will execute `t` times, with each `t` being a valid integer within the given range.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
