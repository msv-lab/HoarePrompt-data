Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1()` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The function iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the characters at position `i` in strings `a` and `b` are the same. If they are, it then checks if the character in `c` at the same position is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If `c[i]` is different, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that a valid template can be found.
   - If the characters in `a` and `b` at position `i` are not the same, the function continues to the next character without setting `possible` to `True`. This means that if `c` has a character that matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it will continue to the next character without affecting the `possible` flag.
   - If no conflicts are found during the iteration, the function prints 'NO', indicating that no valid template exists.

3. **Output Handling**: The function correctly prints 'YES' if a valid template can be found and 'NO' otherwise, based on the logic described above.

Given this analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
