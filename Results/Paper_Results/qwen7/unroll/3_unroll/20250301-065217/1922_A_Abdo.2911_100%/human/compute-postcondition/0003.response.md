Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration based on the conditions inside the loop. For each input 'n', strings 'a', 'b', and 'c' are compared character by character. If any character in 'c' does not match either 'a' or 'b' at the same position where 'a' and 'b' match, 'possible' is set to True and 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if 'c' contains characters that do not conflict with 'a' or 'b', 'NO' is printed. This process repeats 't' times, where 't' is the first input integer.
