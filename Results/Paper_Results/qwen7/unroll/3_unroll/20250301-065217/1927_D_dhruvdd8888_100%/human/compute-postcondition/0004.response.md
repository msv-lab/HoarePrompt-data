Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`; `s` is 0; `e` is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `e` and assigns it the value `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `nums`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
