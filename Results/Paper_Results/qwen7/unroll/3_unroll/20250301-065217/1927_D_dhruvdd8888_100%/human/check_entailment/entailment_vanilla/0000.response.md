Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads `N`, the size of the array.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and appends `-1` at the end to handle boundary conditions easily.
   - It reads the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program uses a list `arr` to store intervals where the value of `nums` changes.
   - It iterates through the array and whenever it encounters a different value, it adds the interval to `arr`.
   - This ensures that `arr` contains intervals where the value of `nums` remains constant.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program finds the relevant interval in `arr` using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - It checks if the start of the interval is within the query bounds. If so, it prints the indices of the start and one position after the start.
   - If the end of the interval is within the query bounds, it prints the indices of the start and end of the interval.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Interval Construction:**
   - The interval construction logic seems correct. It correctly identifies segments where the array values are the same.
   
2. **Query Handling:**
   - The query handling logic is also correct. It uses binary search to find the relevant segment and then checks if the segment boundaries fall within the query range.
   - The logic for printing the result based on the segment boundaries is correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the start of the interval is greater than `l` or when the end of the interval is less than `r` correctly.
   - The program also handles cases where no valid pair exists by printing `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or missing parts.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
