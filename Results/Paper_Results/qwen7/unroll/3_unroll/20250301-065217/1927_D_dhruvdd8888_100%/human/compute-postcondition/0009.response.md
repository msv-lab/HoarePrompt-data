Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `N + 1`. 

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(N + 1)` generates values from `0` to `N`.

3. **Determine the Value of `N`**: From the given information, `N` is equal to `n`, which is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is `0` and `N` (which is `n`) is within its valid range.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `n` (which is `N`) should be within the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive**
