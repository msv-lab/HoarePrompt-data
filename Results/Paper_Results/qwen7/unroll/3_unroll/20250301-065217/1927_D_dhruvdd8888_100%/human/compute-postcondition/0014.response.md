Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the loop iterations. For each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` are read from input, and based on these values and the current state of `arr`, the loop prints either `-1 -1`, or a pair of integers `(s, e+1)`. The final state will consist of the updated `arr` and the printed outputs for each iteration. Without specific input values, we cannot provide a precise numerical output state.
