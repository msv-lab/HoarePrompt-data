### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the array (`n`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`). It also handles the input format correctly by appending `-1` to the end of the array to simplify the logic for finding segments of identical elements.

2. **Segmentation Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies segments of identical elements in the array using a loop. Each segment is stored in the list `arr` as a tuple containing the start index (`1 + s`), the end index (`i`), and the value of `num` for each segment. This ensures that we can quickly identify segments of identical elements.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that lies within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - The program then checks if the identified segment starts before `l` and ends after `r`. If so, it prints `-1 -1` because there are no distinct elements in the queried range.
   - If the segment starts after `l` but before or at `r`, it prints the start and end indices of this segment, ensuring that `a_i â‰  a_j`.
   - If the segment ends after `r`, it also prints `-1 -1` because the segment extends beyond the query range.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the segment starts exactly at `l` but ends before `r`, or when the segment ends exactly at `r` but starts before `l`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find pairs of indices with different elements within the specified query ranges. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.
