testcases is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. d is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9. f is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
