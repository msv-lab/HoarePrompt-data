Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `index` is the index of the element where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**

The code assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
