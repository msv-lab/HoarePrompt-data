You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, the program always returns `ma - mi + 2`, which is not necessarily the minimum length required to turn all cells white.

Consider the test case "BBW". According to the problem description, the minimum length of the segment to be repainted is 2 (painting from the 1st to the 2nd cell). However, the program incorrectly calculates this as `ma - mi + 2`, which would be `3 - 1 + 2 = 4`.

To fix this, the program should find the shortest segment that includes all black cells. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    leftmost_black = float('inf')
    rightmost_black = -1
    has_black = False

    for i, j in enumerate(s):
        if j == 'B':
            leftmost_black = min(leftmost_black, i)
            rightmost_black = max(rightmost_black, i)
            has_black = True

    if not has_black:
        return 0
    else:
        return rightmost_black - leftmost_black + 1

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

This corrected version properly identifies the shortest segment containing all black cells and returns its length.
