Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The code reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), where `p_0` is the count of 1s, `p_1` is the count of 2s, `p_2` is the count of 3s, and `p_3` is the count of 4s.

2. **Computation Inside the Loop**:
   - For each test case, the code computes a value using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{value} = \left(\sum_{i=0}^{3} 3 \cdot \left(\frac{x_i}{2}\right) + x_i \mod 2 \cdot (i < 3)\right) \div 3
     \]
   - Here, `x_i` corresponds to `p_i` (the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `3 * (x // 2)`: This part rounds down `x` to the nearest even number and then multiplies by 3.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)`: This part checks if `i` is less than 3 (i.e., `i` is 0, 1, or 2). If true, it adds 1 to the result (since `x % 2` is 1 for odd numbers and 0 for even numbers).

3. **Summation and Division**:
   - The summation is performed over `i` from 0 to 3.
   - The result of the summation is then divided by 3.

4. **Output**:
   - The computed value for each test case is converted to a string and joined with newline characters (`\n`) to form a single string.
   - This string is then printed.

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and each test case consists of four non-negative integers `p_i` (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), the output will be a series of lines, each containing the computed value for each test case.

Output: **a series of lines, each containing the computed value for each test case (where the value is computed as described above)**
