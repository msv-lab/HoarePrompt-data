Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. For each test case, it computes a value based on these counts using a specific formula and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.**
