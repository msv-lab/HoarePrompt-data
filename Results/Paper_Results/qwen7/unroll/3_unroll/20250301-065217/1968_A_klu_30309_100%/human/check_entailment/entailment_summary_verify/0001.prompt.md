You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers each between 2 and 1000. For each element in `test_cases`, the function computes and returns a list where each element is the largest integer less than the respective element in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the element in `test_cases` and the computed element plus the computed element itself is maximized.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized for each given \( x \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then reads \( t \) integers \( x \) for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these values.
   - Inside `func_1`, it iterates over each \( x \) and finds the corresponding \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

3. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - For each \( x \), it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - For each \( y \), it calculates the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \).
   - It checks if the sum of the GCD and \( y \) is greater than the current `max_sum`.
   - If it is, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to \( y \). The loop breaks after finding the first such \( y \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each \( x \).
   - The loop starts from \( x-1 \) and goes down to 1, ensuring that the first \( y \) found is the largest possible \( y \) that meets the criteria.
   - The use of `break` ensures that once a suitable \( y \) is found, no further iterations are needed, making the solution efficient.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the required \( y \) for each \( x \).

**Correctness: True**
