Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each element represents the value of `best_y` for each corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized.
