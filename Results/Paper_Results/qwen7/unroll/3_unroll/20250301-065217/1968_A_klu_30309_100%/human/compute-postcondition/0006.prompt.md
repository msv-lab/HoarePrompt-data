You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        
        results.append(best_y)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each element corresponds to the value of `best_y` found for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` itself is maximized.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each element corresponds to the largest integer less than the respective x in test_cases such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and best_y plus best_y itself is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers each between 2 and 1000. For each element in `test_cases`, the function returns a list where each element is the largest integer less than the respective element in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the element in `test_cases` and the returned element plus the returned element itself is maximized.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers where each element corresponds to the largest integer less than the respective x in test_cases such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x and best_y plus best_y itself is maximized.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
