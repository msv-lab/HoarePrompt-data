Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It correctly initializes variables and handles the decrement of `na_frente` and `pos_final` by 1 to match zero-based indexing.
3. The program iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, which is appropriate for determining the minimum cost to move to a position within `pos_final`.
4. It uses a variable `best` to keep track of the minimum cost encountered so far, ensuring that the cost is updated only when a better option is found.
5. The logic for updating `total` based on whether it's cheaper to swap or pass is correctly implemented.
6. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
