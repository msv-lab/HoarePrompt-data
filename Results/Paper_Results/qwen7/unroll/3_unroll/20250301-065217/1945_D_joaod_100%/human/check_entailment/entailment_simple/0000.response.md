Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates through each test case. It then reads `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position), and parses the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` which represent the costs of swapping and passing, respectively.

2. **Adjustments**: The program correctly adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because the indices start from 0.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The core logic of the program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost. It iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, updating the `best` cost and `total` cost appropriately. This ensures that the program considers all possible ways to move Kirill to a position within `pos_final` while minimizing the cost.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The program correctly handles the cost calculation for both swapping and passing, ensuring that it chooses the cheaper option at each step.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
