Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for c in range(cases):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `c` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`:**
   - The variable `c` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts because `range(cases)` generates numbers from 0 to cases-1.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `cases` must be at least 1 (since `range(cases)` will generate at least one value if `cases` is 1).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The initial state of `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this variable is not involved in the loop head.
   - The variable `cases` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `c` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `cases` and `c`.

**Final State:**
State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
