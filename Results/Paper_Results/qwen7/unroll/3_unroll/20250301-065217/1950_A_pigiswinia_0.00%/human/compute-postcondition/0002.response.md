Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', based on the comparison of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` entered by the user for each iteration of the loop. The value of `t` is determined by the user's initial input, which is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
