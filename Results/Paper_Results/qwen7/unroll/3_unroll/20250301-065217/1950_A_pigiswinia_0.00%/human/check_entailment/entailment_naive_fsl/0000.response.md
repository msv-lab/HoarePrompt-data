Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (i.e., `a == b == c`). According to the problem description, such a case should output "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly output either "STAIRS" or "PEAK" depending on the order of `b` and `c`. For example, if the input is `1 1 1`, the program will output "STAIRS" instead of "NONE".
