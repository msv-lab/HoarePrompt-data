### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIRS" if true.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if true.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case where `a == b == c` correctly. According to the problem description, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, the output should be "NONE".
   - Let's verify this:
     - If `a == b == c`, both conditions `a < b < c` and `a < b > c` will be false.
     - Therefore, the `else` block will execute, printing "NONE".

Given the annotations and the logic of the program, we can see that the program correctly handles all edge cases, including when `a == b == c`. The program will print "NONE" in this scenario because neither of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` will be true.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly handles the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal and outputs "NONE" as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
