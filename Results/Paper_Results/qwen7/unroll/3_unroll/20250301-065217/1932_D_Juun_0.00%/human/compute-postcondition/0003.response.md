Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and `trump` is the input string representing the trump suit; `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. This does not affect the values of `trumps`, `t`, `n`, `trump`, or the trump suit. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
