Output State: `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards with the same suit as `trump`, `t` is the number of unique ranks in `trumps`, `n` is the number of unique suits in `input()`, `trump` is the string representing the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings of sorted rank-suit pairs for each suit that had a previously assigned rank, `suits` is a dictionary where each key ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') maps to the highest rank assigned to that suit if a new rank was assigned, or to None if no new rank was assigned. If there were no trumps available when a suit needed a rank, the program prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and exits.
