Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it counts how many elements in lists a and b are less than or equal to k/2. If both counts meet or exceed half of k, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
