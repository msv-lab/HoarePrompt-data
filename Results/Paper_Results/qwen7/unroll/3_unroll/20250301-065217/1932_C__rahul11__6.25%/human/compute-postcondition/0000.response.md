Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; the string `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `MOD` is 1000000006.**

Explanation: The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 6`, which is equivalent to `1000000006`. This value is used for modular arithmetic operations later in the program, but it does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
