Output State: The output state is a list `res` of length `n`, where each element `res[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n-1) is calculated based on the initial product `ans` of all elements in `arr`, divided by the appropriate elements in `arr` as specified by the string `s`. Each division is taken modulo `m` and then modulo `1000000006`. The first element of `res` is the initial product of all elements in `arr` reduced modulo `m` and then modulo `1000000006`.
