Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, where each of t test cases contains two positive integers n and m, an array a of n integers, and a string s of length n consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. The function returns different outputs based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**
