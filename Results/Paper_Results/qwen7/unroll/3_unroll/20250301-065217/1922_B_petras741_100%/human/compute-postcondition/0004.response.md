Output State: `buffer` is a list containing the results of the operations performed in each iteration of the loop. Each result is calculated based on the input values of `n` and `w` for each iteration. If `n` is less than 3, the output is 0. Otherwise, the output is calculated using the formula involving the counts of elements in the list `w`.
