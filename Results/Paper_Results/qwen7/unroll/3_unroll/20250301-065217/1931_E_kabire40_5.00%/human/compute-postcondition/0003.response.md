Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a test case defined by t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), where for each test case, it takes n (an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5) and m (an integer between 0 and 2⋅10^6) as part of the test case definition, along with a list a containing n integers (each between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a result based on the processed test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the integer `t`, which indicates the number of such test cases to process. For each test case, it uses two integers `n` and `m`, and a list of `n` integers `a`, to compute and return some result based on these inputs.
