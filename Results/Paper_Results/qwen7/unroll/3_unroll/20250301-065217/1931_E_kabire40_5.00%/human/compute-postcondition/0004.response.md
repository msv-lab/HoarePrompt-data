Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and a list of \( n \) integers. It then reverses each integer in the list, sorts the reversed integers, and reconstructs a new string by alternating between non-sorted and sorted reversed integers. Finally, it compares this reconstructed string with \( 10^{max\_power} \) (where \( max\_power \) is one of the inputs). If the reconstructed string is greater, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.**
