You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and a list of \( n \) integers. It then reverses each integer in the list, sorts the reversed integers, and reconstructs a new string by alternating between non-sorted and sorted reversed integers. Finally, it compares this reconstructed string with \( 10^{max\_power} \) (where \( max\_power \) is one of the inputs). If the reconstructed string is greater, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the rules and logic of the game as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of integers in the list) and `m` (the parameter determining when Sasha wins).
   - It then reads the list of integers.

2. **Reversing Elements:**
   - The program attempts to reverse the digits of each integer in the list.
   - If the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer, it appends the original integer to `rev_res` after reversing.
   - Otherwise, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Reconstructing:**
   - `rev_val` is sorted.
   - The program then constructs a new string `rev_res` by alternating between elements from `rev_val` and their reverses.
   - This part seems unnecessary and incorrect because the problem states that Anna reverses a single element, and Sasha concatenates two elements. The program incorrectly handles the reversal and sorting of the entire list.

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the resulting number `rev_res` is greater than \(10^m\).
   - If true, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversals:**
   - The program should only reverse a single element chosen by Anna, not all elements.
   - The program incorrectly sorts and alternates the reversed elements, which is not part of the game rules.

2. **Game Logic Mismatch:**
   - The game involves alternating turns where Anna reverses one element and Sasha concatenates two elements.
   - The program does not simulate these turns and instead tries to construct a final number, which is not how the game progresses.

3. **Final Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks the final constructed number, but the game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, not when a specific number is reached.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic. It incorrectly handles the reversals and concatenations, and it does not simulate the turns properly.

### Correctness:
**False**
