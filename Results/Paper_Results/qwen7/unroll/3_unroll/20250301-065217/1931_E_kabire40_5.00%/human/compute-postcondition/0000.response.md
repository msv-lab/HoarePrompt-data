Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for y in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `y`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `y`:**
   - The loop will start with `y = 0` because `range(int(input()))` generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`.
   - Therefore, `y` will start at 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `y < int(input())`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start and execute at least once.
   - Since `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can assume that `t` is the input to `int(input())`.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure that the loop can start and execute at least once.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
