Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of numbers based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). The sequence starts with 1 and alternates between two indices of an array containing numbers from 1 to \( n \).**
