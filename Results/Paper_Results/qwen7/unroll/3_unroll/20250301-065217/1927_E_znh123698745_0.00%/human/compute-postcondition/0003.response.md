Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specified constraints (1 <= t <= 10^4 test cases, 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, k is even, and sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5). It returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
