Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is the integer input value, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, and `n` is the integer input value; `edges` is an empty list; `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are lists.**

Explanation: The line `nodes = defaultdict(list)` creates a new dictionary-like object called `nodes` where all values are initialized as lists. This does not affect the values of `empty`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, or `edges`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
