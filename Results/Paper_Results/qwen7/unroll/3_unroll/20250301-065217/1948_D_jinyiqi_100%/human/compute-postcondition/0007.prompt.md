You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input string `s`. The loop checks for substrings of length `j` where each character matches the corresponding character `j` positions ahead, allowing for '?' as a wildcard. If such a substring of length `j` is found, it prints `2 * j` and exits. Therefore, the output could be any even number between 2 and 2*n, depending on the input string, or nothing if no such substring exists.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It also accepts a parameter s, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The function returns a specific value based on the input parameters t and s.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
