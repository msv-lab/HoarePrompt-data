The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for the longest substring where each character matches the character `j` positions ahead, allowing for '?' as a wildcard. If such a substring is found, it prints `2 * j` and exits. If no such substring exists, it prints `0`. The function does not return anything but prints the result directly.
