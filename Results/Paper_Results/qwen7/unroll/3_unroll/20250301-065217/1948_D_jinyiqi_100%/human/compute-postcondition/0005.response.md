Based on the initial state described, the precondition states that the program will check for substrings of a given input string `s` where each character matches the corresponding character `j` positions ahead, allowing for '?' as a wildcard. If such a substring of length `j` is found, it prints `2 * j` and exits. If no such substring exists, it prints `0`.

Given the provided code snippet:

```python
print(0)
```

This directly prints the number `0` without any conditions or checks being performed.

Output: **0**
