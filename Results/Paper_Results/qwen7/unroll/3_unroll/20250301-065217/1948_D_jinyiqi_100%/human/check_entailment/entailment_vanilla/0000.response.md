Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not fully implemented. It should process the string `s` and find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat.

3. **Processing the String**:
   - The function converts the string `s` into a list of characters.
   - It calculates the length of the string `n`.
   - It iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats starting from the largest possible (half the length of the string) down to 1.

4. **Checking Tandem Repeats**:
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks all substrings of length `2j` to see if they form a tandem repeat.
   - It uses a `count` variable to keep track of consecutive matching characters.
   - If it finds a substring where all characters match or are question marks, it increments `count`.
   - If `count` equals `j`, it means a valid tandem repeat of length `2j` has been found, and it prints `2j` and returns.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no valid tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.

### Verification

Let's verify if the program handles the examples correctly:

1. **Example 1: "zaabaabz"**
   - Possible tandem repeats: "aa", "aabbaa", "zaabaabz"
   - The longest is "aabbaa" with length 6.
   - The program should output `6`.

2. **Example 2: "?????"**
   - All characters are question marks, so we can replace them to form "aaaaa" or similar.
   - The longest tandem repeat is "aaaaa" with length 5.
   - The program should output `4` (since it stops at the first valid tandem repeat).

3. **Example 3: "code?????s"**
   - Possible tandem repeats: "code", "codode", "codocodes", etc.
   - The longest is "codocodes" with length 10.
   - The program should output `10`.

4. **Example 4: "codeforces"**
   - No question marks, and no tandem repeats possible.
   - The program should output `0`.

### Conclusion

The program logic seems correct and should handle all the given examples properly. However, there is a minor issue in the implementation of `func_1()`:

- The function does not actually call itself as intended (`func_1()` is called but not used).
- The function should directly process the input string `s` without calling another function.

Given this, the core logic is correct, but the function definition is redundant. Assuming the intention was to have a separate function for clarity, the logic within `func_1()` is sound.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
