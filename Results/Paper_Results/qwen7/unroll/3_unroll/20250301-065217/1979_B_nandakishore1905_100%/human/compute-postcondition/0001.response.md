Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( k \) (which is the absolute difference between \( n \) and \( m \)) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \). If \( k \) is odd, it prints 1. Otherwise, it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \), subtracts it from \( k \), and repeats the process until it finds the largest power of 2 that cannot be further reduced, then prints that value.
