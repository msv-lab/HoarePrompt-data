Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers between 0 and 10^9. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the output cases are not specified, the function likely processes each test case defined by `t`, `x`, and `y` and returns a specific value or result based on the comparison or relationship between `x` and `y`. However, without explicit details on the return values for different conditions, the general functionality is described as above.
