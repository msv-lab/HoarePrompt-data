Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500), and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements, each initialized to 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to the value `10 ** 9`. The length of `ans` is `n`, which is consistent with the initial state where `arr` contains `n-1` integers. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.
