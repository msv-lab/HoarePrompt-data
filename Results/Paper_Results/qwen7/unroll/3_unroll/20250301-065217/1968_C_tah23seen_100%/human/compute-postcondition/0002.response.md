The only variable in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Since `2 ≤ n ≤ 500`, the smallest possible value for `i` is `2 - 2 = 0`, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is n - 2 and must be greater than or equal to 0**
