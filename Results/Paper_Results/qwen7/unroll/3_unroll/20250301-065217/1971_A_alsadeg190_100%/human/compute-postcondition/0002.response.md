Output State: The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and the output consists of pairs of integers printed based on the condition in the loop. For each iteration `i` in the range of `x`, if the first number entered is less than the second number, those numbers are printed as they are. Otherwise, the numbers are printed with their positions swapped.
