Reasoning:
1. The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
2. The provided program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments but reads input within the function.
3. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
4. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.
5. The program checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
6. This logic ensures that the smaller number is always printed first, followed by the larger number, which meets the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
