Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The function `func()` reads a single integer `x` at the beginning, which is supposed to represent the number of test cases, but then it processes only one pair of integers `(x, y)` without looping over all `t` test cases. This means the program will only process the first test case and ignore the rest, failing to meet the requirements for handling multiple test cases.
