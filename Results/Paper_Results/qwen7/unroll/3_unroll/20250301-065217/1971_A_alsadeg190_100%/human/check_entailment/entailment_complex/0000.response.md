Reasoning:
1. The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
2. The annotated program logic correctly processes each test case by reading two integers `x` and `y` and printing the minimum followed by the maximum.
3. The program uses a loop to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate given that `t` (the number of test cases) can be up to 100.
4. The logic inside the loop checks if `x < y` and prints accordingly. This ensures that the smaller number is always printed first, followed by the larger number.
5. There are no logical errors or issues with the provided code snippet that would cause incorrect outputs based on the problem description.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
