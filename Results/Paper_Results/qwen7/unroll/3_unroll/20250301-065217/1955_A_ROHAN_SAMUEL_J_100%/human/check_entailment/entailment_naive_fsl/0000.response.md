Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying yogurts in pairs using the promotion price is more advantageous, especially when `n` is odd. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where the cost of buying `n-1` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt at the regular price is less than the cost of buying all `n` yogurts individually or in pairs.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
Here, `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`. The correct minimum cost should be `15` (buying two yogurts for `11` burles and one yogurt for `5` burles). However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `16` (since `n % 2 == 1` and `2 * a > b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` which is `16`).

To fix this, the program should consider the cost of buying `n-1` yogurts in pairs and one yogurt at the regular price when `n` is odd. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                # Consider the cost of buying n-1 yogurts in pairs and one yogurt at the regular price
                print((n - 1) // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)

func()
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all cases, including when buying in pairs is more advantageous.
