Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic within the function checks the conditions and prints the correct minimum cost for each test case:
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
   - If `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and then one individual).
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (buying all yogurts individually).
   - If `n` is even and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs).

Given the problem statement and the provided logic, the function appears to be correctly implemented and will produce the expected output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
