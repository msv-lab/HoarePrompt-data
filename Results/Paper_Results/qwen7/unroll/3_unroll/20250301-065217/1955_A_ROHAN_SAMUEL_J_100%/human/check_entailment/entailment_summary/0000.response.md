Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func` function matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 1`)**:
   - If \( n \) is odd and \( 2a < b \), the function correctly prints \( an \).
   - If \( n \) is odd and \( 2a \geq b \), the function correctly prints \( \frac{n}{2}b + a \).

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If \( n \) is even and \( 2a < b \), the function incorrectly prints \( an \) instead of \( \frac{n}{2}b \).
   - If \( n \) is even and \( 2a \geq b \), the function correctly prints \( \frac{n}{2}b \).

The issue lies in the condition for even \( n \). The correct logic should be to buy all yogurts at the promotion price when \( 2a \geq b \), regardless of whether \( n \) is even or odd. However, the current implementation only considers even \( n \) separately, which leads to an incorrect calculation.

Given this analysis, the program is not fully correct because it fails to handle the case where \( n \) is even and \( 2a \geq b \) properly.

Correctness: **False**
