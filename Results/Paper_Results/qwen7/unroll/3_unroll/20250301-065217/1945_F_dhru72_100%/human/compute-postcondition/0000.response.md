Output State: **`T` is a type variable, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The given code snippet is a type hint declaration using `TypeVar` for a generic type `T`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, `p`). Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
