Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input values \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \) from each line of the input.
2. It handles the different conditions specified in the problem statement:
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), it checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \).
   - If \( x = k - 1 \), it checks if \( a \geq x + 2 \).
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), it calculates a value \( z \) using a loop and checks if \( a \geq z \).
3. The logic for calculating \( z \) seems to be designed to ensure that Sasha can eventually accumulate enough coins to meet the condition of having at least \( n \) coins, given the constraints.
4. The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
