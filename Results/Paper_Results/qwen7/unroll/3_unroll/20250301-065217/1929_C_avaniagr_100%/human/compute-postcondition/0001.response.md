Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are used to determine whether 'YES' or 'NO' is printed for each line of input. The final output state is a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each line of input processed by the loop.
