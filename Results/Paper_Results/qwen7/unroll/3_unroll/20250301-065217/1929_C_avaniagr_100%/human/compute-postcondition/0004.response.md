Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes each line containing integers k, x, and a, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. For each line, if x is less than k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+1. If x equals k-1, it checks if a is greater than or equal to x+2. Otherwise, it calculates a value z using a loop and checks if a is greater than or equal to z. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each line of input.**
