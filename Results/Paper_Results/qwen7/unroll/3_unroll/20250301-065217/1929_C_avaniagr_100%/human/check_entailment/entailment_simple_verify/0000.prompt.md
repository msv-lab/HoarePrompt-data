You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the input values provided in each line of the file read by `[*open(0)][1:]`. Each line contains values for `k`, `x`, and `a` which are used to determine the output for that specific iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Sasha can lose up to `x` times in a row correctly.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 3 6`
- Expected Output: `NO`

Here’s why the program fails:
- The program checks if `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` and handles these cases separately. However, it does not correctly handle the general case where `x > k - 1`.
- For `x > k - 1`, the program uses a loop to calculate `z` but does not account for the fact that Sasha can only place bets up to his current number of coins. The calculation of `z` does not reflect the constraints of the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `3 3 6`:
- Sasha can lose up to 3 times in a row.
- If Sasha loses 3 times in a row, he will have `6 - 3*6 = -12` coins, which is not possible.

The program should ensure that Sasha can never end up with a negative number of coins after losing `x` times in a row. However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint properly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
