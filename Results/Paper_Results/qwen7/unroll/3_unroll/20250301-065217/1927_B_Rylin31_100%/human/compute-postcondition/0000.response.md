Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized by `range(int(input()))`, meaning it will take values from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider Other Given Variables**: The other given variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- The value of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1**
