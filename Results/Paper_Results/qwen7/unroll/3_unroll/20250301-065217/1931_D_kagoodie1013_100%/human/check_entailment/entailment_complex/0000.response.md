Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and stores them in the `test_cases` list.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, it initializes a `count` variable to zero and creates a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of specific residue pairs.
4. It iterates through each number in the array, calculates the required residues (`r_x` and `r_y`), and updates the `count` based on the existing entries in `residue_map`.
5. The final count for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
6. The function returns the `results` list, which contains the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function matches the requirements. The program correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
