Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each test case individually.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in each test case.
3. Let's analyze the logic within `func_1`:
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the residues `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
   - It checks if there exists a previous element with the same residues using the `residue_map`. If so, it increments the count by the value stored in `residue_map` for that key.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.
4. The function correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic and the given conditions for a pair to be considered beautiful.
5. The final results are printed as required.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs based on the provided problem description and function summary.

Final: **True**
