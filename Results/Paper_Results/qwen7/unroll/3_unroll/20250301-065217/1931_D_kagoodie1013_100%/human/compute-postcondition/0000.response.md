Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about the `results` list and retains the original state of `test_cases`.
