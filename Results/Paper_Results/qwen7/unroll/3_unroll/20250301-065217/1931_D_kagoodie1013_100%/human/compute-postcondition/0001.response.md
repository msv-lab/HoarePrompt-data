State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, (n, x, y, arr) must be a valid tuple from test_cases**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
2. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one valid tuple in `test_cases`.
3. The variables used in the loop header are `(n, x, y, arr)`. These variables are unpacked from the tuples in `test_cases`.
4. Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to specify the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr` inside the loop, but we need to ensure that the tuple structure is correct and that `test_cases` is not empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one valid tuple and that `results` remains an empty list as specified.
