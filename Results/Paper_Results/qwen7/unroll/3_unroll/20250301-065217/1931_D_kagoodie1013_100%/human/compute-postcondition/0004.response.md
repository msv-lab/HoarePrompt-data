Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the sum of counts of number pairs (r_x, r_y) for each input list arr in test_cases.**

Explanation: The given code snippet does not contain any specific values for `test_cases` or the lists `arr`. It only contains a return statement that returns the `results` list, which is defined as a list of integers representing the sum of counts of number pairs `(r_x, r_y)` for each input list `arr` in `test_cases`. Since no specific values or test cases are provided, the output is described in terms of its structure and purpose.
