### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Processing:**
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into manageable parts.
   - For each test case, it extracts the necessary values \( n \), \( x \), \( y \), and the array \( arr \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It iterates through each element in the array, calculating the residues modulo \( x \) and \( y \).
   - For each element, it checks if there exists a previous element with the same residues, which would form a beautiful pair.
   - It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

3. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The calculation of residues \( r_x = -num \% x \) and \( r_y = num \% y \) is correct. This ensures that the conditions for a beautiful pair are met.

4. **Dictionary Usage:**
   - The use of a dictionary `residue_map` to store the count of each residue pair is appropriate. This allows efficient counting of pairs with the same residues.

5. **Output Generation:**
   - The program correctly generates the output by printing the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs according to the problem statement. The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
