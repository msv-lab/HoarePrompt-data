Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. For each test case, the program iterates through the array and calculates the necessary residues.
3. It uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the occurrences of each pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)`.
4. The count of beautiful pairs is determined by checking how many times each pair of residues appears in the array.
5. The logic for calculating residues and counting pairs is correct.
6. The final result is a list of integers representing the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
