You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The values of n, x, and y satisfy 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the sum of counts of number pairs `(r_x, r_y)` for each input list `arr` in `test_cases`. Specifically, for each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`, the loop calculates how many times each pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` appears, where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` for every `num` in `arr`, and then sums these counts to append to `results`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the sum of counts of number pairs (r_x, r_y) for each input list arr in test_cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each input list arr in the test_cases, it calculates the sum of counts of number pairs (r_x, r_y) for each element in arr, where r_x = -num % x and r_y = num % y. It then appends these sums to a results list and returns this list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2. For each test case, it extracts the necessary values (n, x, y, and the array).
3. It uses a function `func_1` to process each test case and calculate the number of beautiful pairs.
4. In `func_1`, it initializes a counter `count` to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
5. It iterates through each element in the array, calculating the residues modulo `x` and `y`.
6. For each element, it checks if there exists a previous element with the same residues, which would form a beautiful pair.
7. It updates the `residue_map` with the current element's residues.
8. Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs according to the problem statement.
