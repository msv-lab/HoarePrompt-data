Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`, which allows it to efficiently count the pairs that satisfy both conditions. The program processes each test case independently and returns the correct count of beautiful pairs for each case. Given the examples and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly without any issues.
