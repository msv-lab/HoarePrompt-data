Reasoning:

The provided function attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Redundant Code**: The code uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. This can be simplified using modular arithmetic.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight and Noon**: The code correctly handles the conversion for most hours but fails to handle the special cases for midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`). Specifically, it incorrectly prints "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM" for `24:00` (which is technically invalid but should be handled as `12:00 PM`), and it incorrectly prints "12:00 AM" for `12:00`.

3. **Generalization**: The code can be generalized using the modulo operation to simplify the logic and handle all cases correctly.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
        
        # Convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format
        h1 = str((int(h) - 1) % 12 + 1)
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        
        # Ensure leading zero for single-digit hours
        if len(h1) == 1:
            h1 = '0' + h1
        
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

With this corrected version, the function will handle all edge cases correctly, including midnight and noon.

Given the issues identified, the original function is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
