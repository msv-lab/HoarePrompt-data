Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider partitions that involve more than two substrings when the string length is greater than 2 and has non-palindromic substrings. 

Consider the following test case:
```
input:
3
aabbaa
abc
aabbcc
```

Expected output:
```
YES
2
aab baa
YES
1
abc
YES
2
aabb cc
```

However, the program only considers partitions into 1 or 2 substrings. It does not explore partitions into more than 2 substrings, which could be valid in some cases. For example, in the string "aabbaa", the program would only consider "aabbaa" as a single substring, missing the valid partition "aab" and "baa".

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not cover all possible valid partitions.
