You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is reduced to 0, and no changes are made to the input integer `t`. For each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions provided in the loop body, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed along with some additional information, and the loop continues to the next iteration until `t` reaches 0. The final state of `t` is 0, and the output consists of the printed results from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if applicable. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the counter `t` is reduced to 0, and the output consists of the printed results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads each string `string` for processing.

2. **Single Character String Handling:**
   - If the string length is 1 (`n == 1`), it correctly prints "NO" because a single character cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Characters:**
   - The program checks if the first and last characters are different (`x != s[-1]`). If they are different, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition, which is correct.

4. **Handling Strings with All Same Characters:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Handling Strings with Almost All Same Characters:**
   - If all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), it further checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.

6. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find a non-palindromic partition.
     - It looks for the first character that is not equal to the corresponding character from the end.
     - If found, it prints "YES" and the two resulting substrings.
     - If no such character is found, it continues checking until it finds a valid partition or concludes that no valid partition exists.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like strings with repeated characters and ensures that it finds a valid partition if possible.

### Verification:

- The program correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
- It handles all specified edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement.
- The logic is sound and follows the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct according to the problem description and examples provided.

**Correctness: **True**
