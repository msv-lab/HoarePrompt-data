Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. It returns a result based on the string `s` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it processes the string `s` and returns a result (though the specific result is not detailed in the given information). The function iterates through up to 10,000 test cases, with each string `s` having a maximum length of 1,000,000 characters, and the total combined length of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 1,000,000 characters.
