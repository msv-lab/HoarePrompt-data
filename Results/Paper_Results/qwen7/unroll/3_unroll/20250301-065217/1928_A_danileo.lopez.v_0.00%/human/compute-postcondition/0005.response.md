Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` indicating the number of pairs `(a, b)` to process. For each pair `(a, b)`, it checks if either `a` or `b` is an even number. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all pairs for each test case, it outputs `t` lines of 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition check.**
