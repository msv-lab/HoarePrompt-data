Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. t is an integer within the range 1 to 50, and n is an integer within the range 2 to 10^3. For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value or result based on the given t and n.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers (t and n) with specified ranges. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without accepting any parameters directly in its definition.
