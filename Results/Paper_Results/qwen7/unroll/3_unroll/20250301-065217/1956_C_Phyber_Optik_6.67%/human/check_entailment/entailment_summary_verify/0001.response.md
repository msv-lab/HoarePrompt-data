### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the provided Python program is correct. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \( \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} \).
- Operations can be either Type 1 (permuting entire rows) or Type 2 (permuting entire columns).
- The solution should use no more than \(2n\) operations.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(t\) and an integer \(n\).
- It calculates a sum based on specific conditions and prints the sum along with a number derived from \(n\) and \(r\).
- It then prints two blocks of lines: the first block contains \(n\) lines with the first column as 1 and the second column as numbers from 1 to \(n\), and the second block contains \(r\) lines with the first column as 2 and the second column as numbers from 1 to \(n\) in a cyclic manner.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating `sum` is incorrect. The program does not maximize the sum of the matrix elements.
   - The current logic does not reflect the actual goal of the problem, which is to strategically place permutations to maximize the sum.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined in the loop.
   - The operations do not follow the rules specified in the problem:
     - Type 1 operations should permute entire rows.
     - Type 2 operations should permute entire columns.
   - The current implementation does not correctly reflect these operations. Instead, it sets the first row and column to `[1, 2, ..., n]` repeatedly, which does not maximize the sum.

#### Correct Solution Approach:
- To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each element \(a_{i,j}\) is set to the maximum possible value, which is \(n\).
- We can achieve this by performing \(n\) Type 1 operations to set each row to `[1, 2, ..., n]` and \(n\) Type 2 operations to set each column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        # Perform n Type 1 operations to set each row to [1, 2, ..., n]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        # Perform n Type 2 operations to set each column to [1, 2, ..., n]
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        # The maximum sum is n * n
        print(n * n, 2 * n)
```

This implementation correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix and uses exactly \(2n\) operations.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
