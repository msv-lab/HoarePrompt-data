Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the matrix elements and the number of operations required.
3. The logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations seems to be based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
4. The program prints the sum and the number of operations in the format specified.
5. The operations printed follow the rules for Type 1 and Type 2 operations as described in the problem.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the logic and the implementation:

- The calculation of `sum` and `r` does not seem to align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` is used in a way that doesn't correctly reflect the problem's constraints.
- The operations printed do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix as required by the problem. The operations should be designed to fill the matrix with the highest possible values in the most efficient way.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
