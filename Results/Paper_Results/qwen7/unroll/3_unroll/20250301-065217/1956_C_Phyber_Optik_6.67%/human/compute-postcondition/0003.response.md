Output State: The output will consist of `t` pairs of lines, each pair containing a sum and a number `n + r`. For each input `n`, it calculates `sum` based on certain conditions and prints `sum` and `n + r`. Then it prints two blocks of lines. The first block prints `n` lines with the first column being 1 and the second column being numbers from 1 to `n`. The second block prints `r` lines with the first column being 2 and the second column being numbers from 1 to `n` in a cyclic manner.
