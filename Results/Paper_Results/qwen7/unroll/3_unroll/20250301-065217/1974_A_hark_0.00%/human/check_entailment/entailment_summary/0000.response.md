Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a grid where each screen is a 5x3 grid.
2. The function `func_2()` seems to be designed to calculate the minimum number of screens required based on the given conditions:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it updates `x` and calculates the sum of the ceiling of `y` divided by 2 and 1.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the ceiling of `y` divided by 2.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the ceiling of `x` divided by 15.
   - If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0.
3. The function `func_1()` is not used in the main logic but might be intended for some internal calculations, though it is not clear from the provided information.
4. The function `func_3()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2()` for each test case, which correctly processes the input and outputs the result for each test case.

Given that the provided functions seem to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summaries match the expected behavior, the overall program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
