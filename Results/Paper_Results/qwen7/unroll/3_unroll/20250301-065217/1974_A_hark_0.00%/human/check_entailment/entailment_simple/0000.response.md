Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function simply returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. It's not used in the main logic of the program, so it doesn't affect the correctness directly. However, its presence is irrelevant to the problem at hand since the problem does not involve comparing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons (`x` and `y`). The logic inside this function is crucial for solving the problem:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed using a specific formula involving the ceiling of `y / 2` and adjusting `x` accordingly.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed as the ceiling of `y / 2`.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed as the ceiling of `x / 15`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function processes `t` test cases, calling `func_2` for each test case. It correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented in `func_2`, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for each test case. The logic in `func_2` matches the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
