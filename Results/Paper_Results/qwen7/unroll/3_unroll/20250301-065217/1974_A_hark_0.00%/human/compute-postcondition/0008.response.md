Output: **math.ceil(y / 2)** (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0)

Explanation:
- `x` is explicitly given as 0.
- `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. This means `y` can be any positive integer like 1, 2, 3, etc.
- `a` is a list of integers but its contents are not relevant to the print statement.

The expression `math.ceil(y / 2)` will take the value of `y`, divide it by 2, and then apply the ceiling function to round up to the nearest integer if the division result is not already an integer. Since `y` is a positive integer, the result of `y / 2` could be either an integer or a float. If `y` is even, `y / 2` will be an integer, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will return that integer. If `y` is odd, `y / 2` will be a float, and `math.ceil(y / 2)` will round it up to the next integer.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `y / 2`, represented as `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
