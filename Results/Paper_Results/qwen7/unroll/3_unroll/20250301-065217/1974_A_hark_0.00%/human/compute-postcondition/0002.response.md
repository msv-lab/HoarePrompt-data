Output State: **t test cases have been processed, but no specific output or state change within each test case is described.**

Explanation: The given code initializes `t` test cases but does not specify what `func_2()` does or how it affects any variables. Therefore, after the loop completes, we know that `t` test cases have been processed, but we cannot provide more detailed information about the state because the effect of `func_2()` is unknown.
