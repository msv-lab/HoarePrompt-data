Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1` Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the necessary parameters or logic to perform the required operations. The function should process the input and produce the desired output, but it currently does nothing meaningful.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Set `S`**:
   - The program attempts to use a `Counter` to count occurrences of elements in `a`, but this is unnecessary and complicates the solution. Instead, it should directly insert the modified values into a set `S`.

3. **Incorrect Construction of Array `b`**:
   - The program constructs `b` by sorting the set `a` and then appending additional elements to `ans`. However, it does not ensure that the final array `b` is constructed in a way that maximizes its lexicographical order.

4. **Missing Key Steps**:
   - The program lacks the crucial steps to ensure that the elements are inserted and deleted in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array `b`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Insert Elements into Set `S`**:
   - For each element `a_i`, insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

2. **Sort the Set `S` in Decreasing Order**:
   - After all elements have been inserted, sort the set in decreasing order to form the array `b`.

3. **Ensure Lexicographical Maximization**:
   - Ensure that the elements are inserted and deleted in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Step 1: Insert elements into set S
    S = set()
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    
    # Step 2: Sort the set S in decreasing order
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 3: Print the result
    print(' '.join(map(str, b)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the elements are inserted into the set `S` correctly and then sorted in decreasing order to form the lexicographically largest array `b`.
