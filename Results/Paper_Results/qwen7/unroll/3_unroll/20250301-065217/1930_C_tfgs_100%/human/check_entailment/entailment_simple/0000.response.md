### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem requirements.

1. **Input Reading and Preparation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It increments each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`.

2. **Generating Unique Elements:**
   - The program uses `Counter(a)` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - This step ensures that each element in the final array `b` is unique and sorted in descending order.

3. **Constructing the Final Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes `cnt` as the difference between `n` and the length of the unique sorted list `a`.
   - It iterates through the unique sorted list `a` and calculates how many times each element can be repeated based on the differences between consecutive elements and the remaining count `cnt`.
   - It appends these calculated values to `ans`.
   - It updates the counter and current count `cur` accordingly.
   - If there are remaining elements to add (`cnt > 0`), it appends `cnt` more elements, each one less than the last element in `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final list `ans`, which represents the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

### Verification:

- **Step 1:** Incrementing each element by its index ensures that each element is unique when added to the set `S`.
- **Step 2:** Sorting the unique elements in descending order and constructing the final array `b` ensures that the elements are in the required order.
- **Step 3:** The logic for appending additional elements to `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements and the remaining count `cnt` ensures that the final array `b` is constructed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
