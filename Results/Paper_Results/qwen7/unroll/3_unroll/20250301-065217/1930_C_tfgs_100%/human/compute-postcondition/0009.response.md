Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list where each element a[i] (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by (i + 1), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is n - len(a).**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `cnt` and assigns it the value of `n - len(a)`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as does the value of `a`, `t`, and `cur`. The `counter` object and the list `a` retain their previous states. Therefore, the only change is that `cnt` is now set to `n - len(a)`.
