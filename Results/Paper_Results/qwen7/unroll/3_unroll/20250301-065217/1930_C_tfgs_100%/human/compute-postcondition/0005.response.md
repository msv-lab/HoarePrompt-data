Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers where each element a[i] (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by (i + 1) after the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

The code `counter = Counter(a)` creates a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the modified list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
