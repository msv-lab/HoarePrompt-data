Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, `a` is a list of unique integers from the original list where each element a[i] (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by (i + 1), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a`, making it a list of unique integers. The original condition that each element `a[i]` is increased by `(i + 1)` after the loop executes all the iterations remains unchanged. The other variables (`counter`, `t`, `n`, and `cur`) are not affected by this operation.
