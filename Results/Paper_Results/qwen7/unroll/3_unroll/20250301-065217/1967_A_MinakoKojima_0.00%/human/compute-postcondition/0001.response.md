Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case will run the loop once.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that the input value (which is `t`) is within the specified range. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust any other variables inside the loop.

4. **Formulate the Final State**: The state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` is within the valid range and that the loop will execute `t` times.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the loop will execute t times**
