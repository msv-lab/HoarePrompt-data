Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`, which is correct because removing any elements won't change the fact that all elements are the same.
4. It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to get unique elements in the array. This step is unnecessary for determining if the array needs to be modified but doesn't affect the correctness of the logic.
5. It iterates through the array and counts the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`. When a different element is encountered, it updates the answer with the minimum count found so far.
6. After the loop, it prints the final minimum count, which is the answer for the current test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. It correctly identifies when the array needs to be modified and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
