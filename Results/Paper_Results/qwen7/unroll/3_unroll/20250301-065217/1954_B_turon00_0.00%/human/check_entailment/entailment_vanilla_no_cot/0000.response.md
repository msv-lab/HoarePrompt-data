Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, but it does not correctly handle the conditions under which an array is beautiful according to the problem statement.

Hereâ€™s why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Beauty**: The solution checks if all elements are the same (`len(aa) == 1`) and prints `-1` if they are. However, this only handles one specific case where the array is already beautiful due to all elements being the same. It does not correctly identify other cases where the array can be made beautiful by the specified operation.

2. **Incorrect Counting Mechanism**: The solution uses `cnt` to count consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. This approach does not account for the condition `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` which is necessary to determine if the array is beautiful. The logic should focus on identifying sequences where the middle element can be removed to break the beauty condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the longest sequence where the middle element can be removed without breaking the beauty condition.
2. Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Dictionary to store the last occurrence of each element
        last_occurrence = {}
        for i in range(n):
            last_occurrence[a[i]] = i
        
        max_length = 0
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                # Find the longest sequence that can be broken by removing one element
                left = i - 1
                right = i + 1
                while left > 0 and right < n-1 and a[left-1] == a[right+1]:
                    left -= 1
                    right += 1
                
                # The length of the sequence that can be broken
                length = right - left + 1
                max_length = max(max_length, length)
        
        # If the entire array can be broken into identical segments, return -1
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the longest sequence that can be broken to make the array non-beautiful and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove accordingly.
