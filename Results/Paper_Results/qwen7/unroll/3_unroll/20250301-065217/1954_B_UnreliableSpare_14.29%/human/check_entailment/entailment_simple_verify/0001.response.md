### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Array Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Non-Beautiful**:
   - The program checks if the array is already non-beautiful by verifying if all elements are the same. This is done using the `flag` variable.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), the program prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to a very large value (`Decimal('Infinity')`) to keep track of the minimum number of removals needed.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element.
   - For each change in the value, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array was initially beautiful (`flag` is `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis:

- The logic for checking if the array is already non-beautiful is correct.
- However, the method to find the minimum number of removals is flawed. The current implementation only counts the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and sets `ans` to 0, which is incorrect. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no two adjacent elements are equal.

### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and calculate the number of elements to remove as the difference between the length of the sequence and 1 (since we want to break the sequence).

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`:
- The longest sequence of consecutive identical elements is `1, 2, 1` (length 3).
- To break this sequence, we need to remove `3 - 1 = 2` elements.

### Revised Code:

```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_len = 1
    current_len = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
            current_len += 1
            max_len = max(max_len, current_len)
        else:
            current_len = 1
    
    ans = max_len - 1 if max_len > 1 else -1
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Revised Code:
- We iterate through the array to find the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
- We maintain a `current_len` to count the length of the current sequence and update `max_len` accordingly.
- After the loop, we calculate the minimum number of elements to remove as `max_len - 1` if `max_len` is greater than 1; otherwise, we print `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of removals. The revised code addresses this issue.

### Final:
**False**
