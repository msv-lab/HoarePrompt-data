Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called within the loop but defined outside the loop without parameters. This will cause a `TypeError` when trying to call `func_1()` inside the loop.

2. **Logic for Checking and Counting**: The logic for checking whether the array is already non-beautiful is flawed. The current implementation checks if all elements are the same, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should check if there are any positions where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

3. **Minimum Removal Calculation**: The calculation of the minimum number of elements to remove is also incorrect. The current logic only counts consecutive occurrences of the same element and does not account for the required operations to make the array non-beautiful.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already non-beautiful
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if arr[i-1] == arr[i+1] and arr[i] != arr[i-1]:
                print(1)
                continue
        
        # If the array is beautiful, find the minimum removals
        if all(arr[i-1] == arr[i+1] for i in range(1, n-1)):
            max_count = 0
            current_count = 1
            for i in range(1, n):
                if arr[i] == arr[i-1]:
                    current_count += 1
                else:
                    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
                    current_count = 1
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            print(n - max_count)
        else:
            print(-1)
```

This corrected version properly checks if the array is already non-beautiful and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array is no longer beautiful.
