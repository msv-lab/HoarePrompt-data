Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration.
   - `n` is mentioned as remaining unchanged.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **List the adjusted states**:
   - `flag` remains unchanged (False).
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `val` is equal to `arr[0]`.
   - `cnt` is 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`flag` is False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0**.
