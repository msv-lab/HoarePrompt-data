Output State: `flag` is False, t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged.

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, `flag` will be set to False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
