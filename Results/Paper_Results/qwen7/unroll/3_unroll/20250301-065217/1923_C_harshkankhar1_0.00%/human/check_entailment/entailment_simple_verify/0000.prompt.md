You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. The array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the formula `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x`, with `x = 1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all iterations, `b` will contain values where each element (except the first one which is 0) is the sum of the previous element in `b` and either 1 or 2, depending on whether the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1 or not.

        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer, n is an input integer, q is the number of iterations the loop has executed, a is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements from the original input list up to that index, b is a list of length n + 1 where each element (except the first one which is 0) is the sum of the previous element in b and either 1 or 2 depending on whether the corresponding element in a is greater than 1 or not, the loop has printed 'NO' for pairs (x, y) where a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or x equals y, and printed 'YES' otherwise for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program does not check if the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) such that the sum of elements in both arrays is equal, no element in the subarray is the same as its corresponding element in \(b\), and all elements in \(b\) are positive.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

- For the subarray `1 2 1 4 5` (query 1), the program prints `NO`, which is incorrect because we can transform it into `2 1 2 5 6` (where the sum of elements is the same and no element is the same as its corresponding element in \(b\)).

- For the subarray `4` (query 2), the program prints `NO`, which is correct.

- For the subarray `1 4` (query 3), the program prints `YES`, which is correct.

- For the subarray `1 3` (query 4), the program prints `NO`, which is incorrect because we can transform it into `2 1 2` (where the sum of elements is the same and no element is the same as its corresponding element in \(b\)).

The program does not correctly handle the transformation logic required to determine if a subarray is good. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
