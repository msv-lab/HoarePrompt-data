Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called properly within the main loop.
   - The main loop should call `func_1()` for each test case, but it currently calls `func_1()` once and then does nothing with the result.

2. **Accumulation and Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the prefix sums (`a`) and a modified prefix sum (`b`).
   - `a` is the prefix sum of the array `c`.
   - `b` is constructed such that `b[i]` represents a value derived from `a[i]`. Specifically, `b[i]` is calculated as `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program prints the prefix sums `a` but does not use them for further processing.
   - It then processes each query by comparing the difference between the prefix sums at indices `y` and `x-1` with the corresponding values in `b`.
   - If the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y` is met, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function Call Issue:**
   - The main loop should call `func_1()` for each test case, but it only calls it once and does not process subsequent test cases.

2. **Logic for Determining Good Subarray:**
   - The logic used to determine if a subarray is good is flawed. The comparison `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` does not correctly reflect the conditions for a good subarray.
   - A subarray is good if there exists a permutation `b` such that the sum of elements in both arrays is equal, no element is the same, and all elements in `b` are positive. The current logic does not check these conditions properly.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the comparison, which is incorrect due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
