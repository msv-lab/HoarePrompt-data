Output State: t is a positive integer, n is an input integer, q is the number of iterations the loop has executed, a is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements from the original input list up to that index, b is a list of length n + 1 where each element (except the first one which is 0) is the sum of the previous element in b and either 1 or 2 depending on whether the corresponding element in a is greater than 1 or not, the loop has printed 'NO' for pairs (x, y) where a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or x equals y, and printed 'YES' otherwise for each iteration.
