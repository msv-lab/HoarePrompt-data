Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function reads the values of \( n \) and \( q \).
   - It initializes an array `a` with zeros and then populates it with the input values.
   - It also initializes an array `b` which is used to store cumulative sums.
   - The loop calculates the value of `x` as either 1 or 2 based on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1.
   - It then updates the cumulative sum array `b`.
   - After calculating the cumulative sums, it prints the array `a` (which is not required according to the problem statement).
   - Finally, it processes each query by checking if the subarray is good using the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]`.

2. **Checking the Subarray Condition:**
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i], c[l_i+1], ..., c[r_i]` can be equal to some other set of positive integers `b` where each `b_i > 0` and `b_i != c_i` for all indices.
   - This condition is derived from the fact that the sum of the subarray must be less than the sum of the cumulative values adjusted by the initial values, ensuring the possibility of rearranging the elements to meet the conditions.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - The program correctly handles each query by checking the condition for the subarray.
   - If the condition is met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Verification of Correctness:

- The logic for determining if a subarray is good is sound and follows the problem constraints.
- The implementation correctly uses cumulative sums to check the condition for each subarray.
- The additional constraints on the input (sum of \( n \) and \( q \)) are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
