Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases through an internal mechanism. For each test case, it takes an array `c` of length `n`, two positive integers `n` and `q`, and a series of queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It processes these inputs to determine the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` for each query and returns the results accordingly.**

This means the function internally handles multiple test cases, each with its own array `c`, number of elements `n`, number of queries `q`, and a series of query ranges `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it calculates the sum of the specified subarray and returns these sums as the output.
