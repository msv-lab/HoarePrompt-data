Output State: The output state will vary based on the input integer `t` and the binary representation of each `x`. For each `x`, the program converts it to a 30-bit binary string, processes it according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. The processing rules include flipping certain bits and converting some '1's to '-1's under specific conditions. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each containing a modified 30-bit binary string or a 31-bit binary string if the length was increased, followed by the length of the string.
