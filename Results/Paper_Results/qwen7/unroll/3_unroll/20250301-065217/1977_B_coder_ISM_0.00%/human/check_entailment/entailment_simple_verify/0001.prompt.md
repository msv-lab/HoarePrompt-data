You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will vary based on the input integer `t` and the binary representation of each `x`. For each `x`, the program converts it to a 30-bit binary string, processes it according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. The processing rules include flipping certain bits and converting some '1's to '-1's under specific conditions. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each containing a modified 30-bit binary string or a 31-bit binary string if the length was increased, followed by the length of the string.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program attempts to find the binary representation of `x` using a list `s` initialized with 30 elements.
   - It iterates over the bits from 0 to 29 (since \(2^{30}\) is the upper limit).
   - If the bit at position `i` is set in `x`, it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The program then iterates over the bits again to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits.
   - If a zero bit is found after a `1`, it changes the `1` to `-1` and sets a flag.
   - If two consecutive `1`s are found, it changes the first `1` to `-1` and the second to `0`.
   - If necessary, it adjusts the length and ensures the constraints are met.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the array.
   - It then prints the modified array.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Consecutive Non-Zero Bits:**
   - The logic to handle consecutive non-zero bits is flawed. Specifically, the flag handling and bit modification do not correctly ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits.

2. **Length Calculation:**
   - The length calculation is based on a fixed 30-bit representation, which may not always be accurate. The actual length should be determined by the number of non-zero bits in the final array.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format should strictly follow the problem statement, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example test case `x = 14`:
- Binary representation: `1110`
- Initial array: `['1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`
- After adjustments, the array should be: `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]`

The program fails to correctly adjust the array to meet the constraints.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to generate a valid array according to the problem constraints.
