Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)) and a positive integer \( x \) (where \( 1 \leq x < 2^{30} \)). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into a 30-bit binary string, modifies this string according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. If the length of the binary string is increased during processing, it also prints the new length. The modifications include flipping certain bits and converting some '1's to '-1's under specific conditions.**
