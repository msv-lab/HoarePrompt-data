Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Median Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the median index. For an array of even length `n`, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the problem specifies that the median should be the element at the ceiling of `k/2` index in the sorted array. This means for an even `n`, the median should be the element at index `n//2`.

2. **Heap Usage**: The use of a heap to find the minimum number of operations is unnecessary and complicates the solution. Instead, we can directly compare the median with the elements around it to determine the minimum number of operations needed.

3. **Sorting and Operations Counting**: The sorting and heap operations are not necessary. We can directly count the number of operations needed to make the median greater than its current value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        arr = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
        test_cases.append((n, arr))
        index += 1 + n
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        arr.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        # Count how many operations are needed to make the median greater
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if arr[i] <= current_median:
                operations += current_median - arr[i] + 1
                arr[i] = current_median + 1
            else:
                break
        
        results.append(operations)
    return results
```

This version correctly calculates the median and counts the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.
