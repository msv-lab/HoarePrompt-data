Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `t` or `test_cases`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
