Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input from stdin and processes it to form test cases. This part is handled well, ensuring that each test case is correctly parsed and stored in the `test_cases` list.

2. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
   - It sorts the array to find the median index and the initial median value.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements until the median is increased.
   - The logic to increment the smallest elements in the heap until the median is increased is correct.

3. **Heap Usage**:
   - The use of a heap to manage the elements to be incremented is appropriate. By maintaining a heap of elements from the median index onwards, we can efficiently find and increment the smallest elements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the median is already the maximum possible value after incrementing the smallest elements. However, it's important to note that the program assumes the array is sorted initially, which is a valid assumption since sorting is done within the function.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the number of operations required for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
