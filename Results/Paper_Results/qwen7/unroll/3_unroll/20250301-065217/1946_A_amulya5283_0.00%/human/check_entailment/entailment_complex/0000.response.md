Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes them. This part is handled well by reading all input at once and then splitting it into individual test cases.

2. **Sorting and Median Calculation**: For each test case, the array is sorted, and the median index is calculated correctly. The median index is determined as `n // 2` for both even and odd lengths of the array.

3. **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the sorted array. This is a good approach to focus only on the relevant part of the array for finding the minimum operations needed to increase the median.

4. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the elements from the median onwards. By incrementing the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median, the program ensures that the median is increased with the minimum number of operations.

5. **Result Calculation**: The number of operations required to achieve this is correctly counted and added to the results list.

6. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct.

Given the above points, the logic and implementation in the provided code seem to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
