Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires counting the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on specific conditions involving two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function processes each test case and calculates the count of beautiful pairs. It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs \((rx, ry)\) where \(rx = (-a \% x + x) \% x\) and \(ry = a \% y\). If a pair \((rx, ry)\) appears more than once, it increments the count.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes it into test cases, and then calls `func_1` to get the results. It then prints the results for each test case.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Input Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles the input format and splits it into test cases.
   - **Processing Logic**: `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.
   - **Output**: `func_2` correctly prints the results for each test case.

Given that both functions work together to process the input and produce the expected output, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
