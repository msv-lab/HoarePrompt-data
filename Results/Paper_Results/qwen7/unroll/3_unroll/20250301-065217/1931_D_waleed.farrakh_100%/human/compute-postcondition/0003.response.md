Output State: **`t` is now the integer value of the first line in `data`, `data` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `input` retain their original values, `test_cases` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `test_cases`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `data`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `input` remain unchanged, and `test_cases` is set to an empty list.
