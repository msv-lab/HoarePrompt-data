You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `count` calculated for each corresponding test case in `test_cases`. For each test case, the value of `count` is determined by counting how many pairs `(rx, ry)` appear more than once during the iteration over the array `arr`, with `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.

    #The program returns a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the count of pairs (rx, ry) that appear more than once for each corresponding test case in 'test_cases'. For each test case, rx is calculated as (-a % x + x) % x and ry is calculated as a % y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains the size of an array `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and an array `arr` of integers. For each test case, it calculates the count of unique pairs `(rx, ry)` that appear more than once in the array `arr`. Here, `rx` is computed as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y` for each element `a` in `arr`. The function returns a list of integers called `results`, where each integer corresponds to the count of such pairs for each test case.

    #State: The output state will be the same as the initial state because the loop only prints the results from the `results` list without modifying any variables. The `results` list is derived from `func_1(test_cases)` and remains unchanged during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `n`, `x`, `y`, and an array `arr`. It then processes these test cases using `func_1` and prints the results. The function does not return any value but modifies no global state outside of its scope.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to store the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.
   - `count` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, compute `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This computes the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`. The expression ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - Check if the tuple `(rx, ry)` exists in the `freq` dictionary:
     - If it exists, add the value of `freq[rx, ry]` to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the final `count` to the `results` list and return it.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the entire input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Splits the input into lines.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Appends the test case to the `test_cases` list in the format `(n, x, y, arr)`.

3. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and stores the results.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - Iterates over the results and prints each one.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation `(-a % x + x) % x` correctly handles negative remainders, ensuring `rx` is always non-negative.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct. It checks if the required conditions for a beautiful pair are met by leveraging the remainders.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of pairs is appropriate and efficient.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - The input reading mechanism in `func_2` is correct and handles the large input sizes efficiently.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic in both functions is sound and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem description.
