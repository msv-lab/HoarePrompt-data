### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components and logic of the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure accuracy:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: Initializes `results` and `freq` dictionary, and sets `count` to 0.
   - **Loop through the array**: For each element `a` in the array `arr`, computes `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y` computes the remainder.
   - **Check and update frequency**: Checks if the tuple `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, adds the frequency to `count`. Updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.
   - **Return results**: Appends the final `count` to `results` and returns it.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: Reads the entire input from standard input and splits it into lines.
   - **Processing Test Cases**: Iterates over each test case, extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`, and appends them to `test_cases`.
   - **Calling `func_1`**: Calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and stores the results.
   - **Printing Results**: Iterates over the results and prints each one.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation `(-a % x + x) % x` correctly handles negative remainders, ensuring `rx` is always non-negative.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct. It checks if the required conditions for a beautiful pair are met by leveraging the remainders.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of pairs is appropriate and efficient.

4. **Input Reading**:
   - The input reading mechanism in `func_2` is correct and handles the large input sizes efficiently.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic in both functions is sound and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the given problem description.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**
