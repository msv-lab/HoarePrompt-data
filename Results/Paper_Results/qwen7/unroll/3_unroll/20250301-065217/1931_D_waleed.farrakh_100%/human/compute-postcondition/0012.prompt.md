You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, x, and y are integers for each test case such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9; arr is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the list, and the length of arr is n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` is a list containing tuples of the form (n, x, y, arr), where each tuple corresponds to the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` extracted from `data`. `idx` is `2 * t + 1`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state will be the same as the initial state because the loop only prints the results from the `results` list without modifying any variables. The `results` list is derived from `func_1(test_cases)` and remains unchanged during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), a list arr (containing n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the length of arr is n), and two integers n, x, and y (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9). The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
