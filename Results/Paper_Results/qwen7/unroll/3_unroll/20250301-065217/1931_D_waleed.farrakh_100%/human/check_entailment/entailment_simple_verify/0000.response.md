### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to store the frequency of `(rx, ry)` pairs.
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, calculate `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.

3. **Check and update the frequency dictionary**:
   - If `(rx, ry)` is already in `freq`, it means there is another element in the array that forms a beautiful pair with the current element. Hence, we increment `count` by the frequency of `(rx, ry)`.
   - Update the frequency of the current `(rx, ry)` pair in `freq`.

4. **Return the count**:
   - After processing all elements, append the `count` to the `results` list.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading input**:
   - Read the input from stdin and split it into lines.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Process each test case**:
   - Call `func_1` with the test case details.
   - Print the result for each test case.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Logic for Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies beautiful pairs by checking if the remainders of the sum and difference of two elements are divisible by `x` and `y` respectively.
   - The use of the frequency dictionary ensures that each pair is counted only once, which is crucial for efficiency.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases well, such as when `x` or `y` are large, and the array contains very large numbers.
   - The modulo operations ensure that the remainders are always within a manageable range.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads and processes multiple test cases from stdin, making it suitable for large inputs.

Given the detailed analysis and the provided annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs and handles the input and constraints appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description, the logic implemented, and the handling of edge cases.
