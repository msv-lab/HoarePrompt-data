### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each element `a` in the array and calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
   - These calculations ensure that `rx` and `ry` are always non-negative and within the bounds of `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - A frequency dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of how many times each `(rx, ry)` pair has been seen.
   - For each element `a`, the function checks if the `(rx, ry)` pair has already been seen in the frequency dictionary. If so, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
   - The function updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(rx, ry)` pair.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It then prints the results from `func_1`.

3. **Overall Logic Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies beautiful pairs by checking the conditions `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - The use of the frequency dictionary ensures efficient counting of pairs without redundant calculations.
   - The input reading and processing in `func_2` are correct and do not introduce any errors.

4. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - The provided code handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as when `x` or `y` are very large, and when the array contains duplicate elements.
   - The constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are handled appropriately by the algorithm.

Given the thorough analysis and the correctness of the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs in the array, and there are no issues with the given code.
