Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), a list arr (containing n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the length of arr is n), and two integers n, x, and y (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9). The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.**
