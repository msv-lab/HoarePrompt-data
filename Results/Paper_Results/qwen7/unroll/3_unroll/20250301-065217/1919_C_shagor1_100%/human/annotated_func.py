#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    pass
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`. If `n` is within the range 1 to 2⋅10^5 and each `a_i` is within the range 1 to `n`, the function performs some unspecified processing; otherwise, it returns an error or a specific message indicating the input is invalid.
