Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases internally. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`. It returns a result based on the given conditions: if the integer `n` is within the range 1 to 2⋅10^5 and each element `a_i` in the list is within the range 1 to `n`, then it processes these inputs; otherwise, it returns an error or a specific message indicating the input is invalid.**
