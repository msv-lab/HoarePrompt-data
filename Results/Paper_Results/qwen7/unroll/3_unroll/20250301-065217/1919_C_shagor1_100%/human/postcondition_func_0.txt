The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`. If `n` is within the range 1 to 2⋅10^5 and each `a_i` is within the range 1 to `n`, the function performs some unspecified processing; otherwise, it returns an error or a specific message indicating the input is invalid.
