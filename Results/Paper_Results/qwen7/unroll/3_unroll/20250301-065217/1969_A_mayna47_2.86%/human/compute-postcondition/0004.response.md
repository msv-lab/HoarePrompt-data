Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 2 and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length 3 where the first element is 0 and the rest are converted from the input split and mapped to integers, and the condition `n == 2` is satisfied.
