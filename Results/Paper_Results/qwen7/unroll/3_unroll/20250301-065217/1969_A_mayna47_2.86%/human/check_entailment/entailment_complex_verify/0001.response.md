### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The function `func_1` should be called `t` times, once for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - In `func_1`, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `v` representing the best friends.
   - If `n == 2`, it prints `2` directly because both friends are each other's best friends and must be invited.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through each friend and checks if the friend and their best friend's best friend form a cycle of length 2 (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and can be invited together.
   - If no such pair exists, it correctly assumes that at least three friends need to be invited to ensure at least two friends come to the party.
   - The code handles the special case of `n == 2` correctly by printing `2`.
   - However, the code does not handle the case where there might be multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. It only checks for one such pair and stops as soon as it finds one. This means it might miss other valid pairs and could incorrectly print `3` when a smaller number of invitations would suffice.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where `n == 2` correctly by printing `2`.
   - The main loop in `func_1` ensures that all friends are checked, but it does not guarantee that all possible pairs are considered if there are multiple valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. While it handles the special case of `n == 2` correctly, it fails to consider all possible pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. Therefore, it might incorrectly print `3` when a smaller number of invitations would suffice.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
