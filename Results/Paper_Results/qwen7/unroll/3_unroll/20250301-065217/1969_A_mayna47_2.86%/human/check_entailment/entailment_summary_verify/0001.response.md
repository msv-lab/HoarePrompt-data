### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The function `func_1` should be called `t` times, once for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - In `func_1`, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `v` representing the best friends.
   - If `n == 2`, it prints `2` directly because both friends are each other's best friends and must be invited.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through each friend and checks if the friend and their best friend's best friend form a cycle of length 2 (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and can be invited together.
   - If no such pair exists, it correctly assumes that at least three friends need to be invited to ensure at least two friends come to the party.
   - The code handles the special case of `n == 2` correctly by printing `2`.
   - However, the implementation of the main logic has a flaw. Specifically, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` does not necessarily mean that both friends in the pair will come to the party. This condition only checks if the friend and their best friend's best friend form a cycle of length 2, but it does not guarantee that the friend and their best friend will both receive invitations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where `n == 2` correctly by printing `2`.
   - However, the main loop in `func_1` does not correctly identify all possible pairs of friends who can be invited together. For example, consider the input `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. The function will incorrectly print `2` because it only checks the first friend and their best friend's best friend, missing the fact that friends 4 and 5 are also each other's best friends and can be invited together.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for identifying pairs of friends who can be invited together is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
