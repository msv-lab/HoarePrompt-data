Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is 2.
- `p` is a list of 2 integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ 2 and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. This means `p` could be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`.
- `v` is a list of length 3 where the first element is 0 and the rest are converted from the input split and mapped to integers. Since no specific input is given, we cannot determine the exact values of the second and third elements of `v`.
- The condition `n == 2` is satisfied.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`, which will output the integer 2.

Output: **2**
