Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect `t` or the list `p`. The precondition for `t` and `p` remains unchanged.
