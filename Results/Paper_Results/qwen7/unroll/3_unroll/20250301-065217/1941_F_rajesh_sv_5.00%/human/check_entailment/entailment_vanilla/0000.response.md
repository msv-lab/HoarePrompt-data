### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - Functions `func_1` and `wrapper` are defined but not used in the main logic of the program. These functions appear to be part of a caching mechanism, but they are not utilized in the provided code.
   
2. **Reading Input**:
   - Functions `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6` are defined to read input from standard input. This is consistent with the problem statement.
   - `func_4` reads multiple space-separated integers, which is appropriate for reading the complexities of the problems, models, and functions.
   - `func_6` reads a single line of input, which is used to read the number of test cases.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It initializes variables `A`, `D`, and `F` to store the complexities of the prepared problems, models, and functions, respectively.
   - It calculates the initial maximum difference (`max_diff`) and its corresponding index.
   - It then iterates through the functions to find the optimal addition that minimizes the imbalance.
   - The logic uses binary search (`bisect_right` and `bisect_left`) to efficiently find the best position to insert the new problem complexity.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum achievable imbalance.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no improvement is possible by comparing the result with `next_max_diff`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes it, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
