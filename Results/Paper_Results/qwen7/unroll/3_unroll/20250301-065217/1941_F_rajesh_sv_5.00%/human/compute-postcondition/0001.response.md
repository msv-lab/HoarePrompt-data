State: **`testcases` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `range(testcases)`. The only relevant state here is `testcases`.

2. **Determine Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `testcases` is a positive integer. Given that `t` is defined such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `testcases` is the result of `func_3()`, we need to ensure that `testcases` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust States**: Since the loop will iterate based on the value of `testcases`, it must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing. The value of `t` itself does not directly affect the loop's execution but is given as a constraint for `testcases`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `testcases` is at least 1.
