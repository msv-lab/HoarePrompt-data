Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, `a` is a list of n integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of the first element in the list `data` (at index `idx`, which is 0) to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented to 1 because the next element in `data` will be processed in subsequent steps. The values of `data`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
