Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing through a predefined list `a` of integers. It processes a list `a` which contains `n` integers representing the numbers on cards in a player's hand, where `t` (the number of test cases) is an integer and `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and `n` (the number of cards in each player's hand) is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`. For each test case, it checks the list `a` and returns a result based on the conditions specified.**

This means the function `func_2` indirectly accepts parameters `t` and `n` through its processing of a list `a` and performs operations based on these inputs, returning a result for each test case.
