Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, playing a card game where each player starts with \( n \) cards out of a total of \( 2n \) cards. The goal is to maximize your score by selecting cards such that you gain points when placing a card that matches a card already on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(n, a)**:
     - This function calculates the number of pairs of identical cards in your hand using a `Counter`.
     - It then returns the minimum value between the number of such pairs and \( \frac{n}{2} \).
     - The logic here is that if you have more than \( \frac{n}{2} \) pairs, you can't guarantee more than \( \frac{n}{2} \) points because Nene will block you if possible.
     - This function correctly models the scenario where you can only score up to \( \frac{n}{2} \) points if Nene plays optimally.

   - **func_2()**:
     - This function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.
     - It correctly handles reading input, processing each test case, and printing the results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` accurately reflects the constraints and rules of the game.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get based on the given constraints and rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
