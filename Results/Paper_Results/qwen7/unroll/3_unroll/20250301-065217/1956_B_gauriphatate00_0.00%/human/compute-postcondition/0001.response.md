Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, `a` is a list of n integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `input()`, which is set to `sys.stdin.read`, splits the input into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t` and `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
