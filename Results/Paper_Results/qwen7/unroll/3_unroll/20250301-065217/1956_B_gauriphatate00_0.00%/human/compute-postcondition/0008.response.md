Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `idx` is given as `2 + t * (1 + n)`.
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `data` is a list of strings (not involved in the loop).
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `a` is a list of n integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand for each iteration (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `results` is a list of outputs from `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, `results` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute.
   - There is no specific initialization or modification needed for `result` within the loop itself; its value is taken from `results` during each iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `results` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final State**:
State: **`results` must be a non-empty list**
