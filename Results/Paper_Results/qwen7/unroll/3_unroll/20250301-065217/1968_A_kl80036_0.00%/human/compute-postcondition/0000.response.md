Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a non-negative integer.
   - Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the input will always be a valid number within this range.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `t` is given as a positive integer between 1 and 1000, we need to ensure that the input matches this condition.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration of the loop.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and the input value should be within the specified range.

Given these points, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `i` and the condition for the input.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 0 (since the loop starts with `i = 0`).

Since the input value must match `t`, we need to ensure that the input is within the specified range. However, since the problem specifies that `t` is already a valid input, we don't need to explicitly mention the input value itself but rather the condition it must satisfy.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 0**
