Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program is to set `y` to be half of `x` (i.e., `y = x // 2`). However, this approach does not guarantee that the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) will be maximized.

To maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor. A better approach would be to iterate through possible values of `y` from 1 to \(x-1\) and find the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max_gcd_y_sum = 0
        best_y = 0
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_gcd = gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = current_gcd + y
            if current_sum > max_gcd_y_sum:
                max_gcd_y_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        print(best_y)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates through all possible values of `y` from 1 to \(x-1\), calculates \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for each, and keeps track of the `y` that gives the maximum value. This ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
