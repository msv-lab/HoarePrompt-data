Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. However, the current implementation simply prints \( y = x // 2 \), which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example:
- If \( x = 10 \), the output is \( y = 5 \). But \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10\).
- If \( x = 21 \), the output is \( y = 10 \). But \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 13\), which is not the maximum possible value. The maximum would be achieved with \( y = 14 \) because \(\gcd(21, 14) + 14 = 21\).

Therefore, the solution provided does not meet the requirement of maximizing \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Correctness: **False**
