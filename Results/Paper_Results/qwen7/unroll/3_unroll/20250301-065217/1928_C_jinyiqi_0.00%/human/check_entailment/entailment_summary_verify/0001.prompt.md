You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. It finds all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, stores them in `output1` in reverse order, and their corresponding quotients in `output2`. Finally, it returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the position `n` and the number `x` for each test case.

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of `k` such that the settling pattern fits the given position `n` and the number `x`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The position `n` and the number `x` must satisfy certain conditions based on the settling pattern.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns the divisors in ascending order.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - If either condition is true, it calls `func_1` on the respective value and processes the divisors.
   - It filters the divisors to find those that satisfy the conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

6. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a set to remove duplicates before returning the result.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are necessary but not sufficient. They ensure that `2k - 2` divides `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, which implies `k` can be derived from these conditions.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of the given number.
   - However, the logic inside the main loop needs to be corrected to properly filter and count valid `k` values.

3. **Filtering and Counting:**
   - The filtering logic should correctly identify valid `k` values based on the divisor conditions.
   - The final output should be the count of valid `k` values.

### Corrected Program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []

    # Check the first condition
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n + x - 2) // 2 + 1
        if k > 1 and k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 >= x:
            output.append(k)

    # Check the second condition
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n - x) // 2 + 1
        if k > 1 and k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 >= x:
            output.append(k)

    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws in how it processes the divisors and filters the valid `k` values. The corrected program ensures that the conditions are correctly checked and filtered.

Correctness: **False**
