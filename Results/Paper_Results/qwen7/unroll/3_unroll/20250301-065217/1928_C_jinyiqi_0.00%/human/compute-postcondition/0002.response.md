Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x ** 0.5`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `output2` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to start, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be a positive integer.
   - This means `x ** 0.5` must be at least `1`, implying `x` must be at least `1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is the variable used in the loop, we need to ensure that `x` is at least `1`.
   - The value of `i` will start from `1` and increment until it reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 1**.
