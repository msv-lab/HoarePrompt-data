Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining how many values of \( k \) satisfy the given conditions for a given position \( n \) and number \( x \). The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions, and we need to find all possible \( k \) such that the number assigned to position \( n \) is \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern can be described as repeating every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that the number at position \( n \) is \( x \).
   - The key is to determine the divisors of \( (n - x) \) and \( (n + x - 2) \), as these will give us potential values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - The logic of the main program is to check both \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) for possible values of \( k \).

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even, which is necessary for \( k \) to be an integer.
   - It then uses `func_1` to get the divisors and filters them based on the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The final output is deduplicated using `set` and converted back to a list, ensuring no duplicate values of \( k \) are included.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The steps are logically sound, and the implementation matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
