The function accepts an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. It finds all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, stores them in `output1` in reverse order, and their corresponding quotients in `output2`. Finally, it returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`.
