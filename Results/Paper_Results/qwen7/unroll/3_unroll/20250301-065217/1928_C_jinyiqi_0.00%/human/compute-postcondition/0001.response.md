Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `output2` as an empty list. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `output2` is the only new variable introduced with a specific value (an empty list), while `x` and `n` retain their initial conditions.
