Output State: **The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` (which contains the corresponding quotients for each divisor of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`) and `output1` (which contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order)**
