Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `output1 = []` initializes an empty list named `output1`. This does not change the values of `x` or `n`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `x` and `n` remain the same as the initial state, and `output1` is now an empty list.
