Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of `x` and returns them in a combined list where divisors are paired with their corresponding quotients. This part is correct and works as intended.

2. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic checks two conditions for each test case:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the total length of the sequence is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to repeat properly.
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the position `x` is within the repeating segment of the sequence.
   - If either condition is met, the function calls `func_1` on the appropriate value (`n + x - 2` or `n - x`) and processes the returned divisors to check if they satisfy the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - The results are stored in a set to avoid duplicates before being converted to a list.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem specifies that the settling does not exist for `k = 1`, which is handled implicitly by the conditions checked in the main logic.
   - The solution correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks the necessary conditions and processes the divisors appropriately to find the valid values of `k`.

Correctness: **True**
