### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect because the provided program does not correctly simulate the game according to the problem description. Let's break down the issues and provide a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling and Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the array elements.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element, but this is not necessary for simulating the game.

2. **Game Simulation**:
   - The original program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - Alice and Bob should take turns picking elements from the array `a` as described in the problem statement.
   - Alice picks elements that are not already chosen by Bob, and Bob picks any remaining elements.

3. **Building Array `c`**:
   - The program does not build the array `c` as Alice's choices.
   - Instead, it tries to determine the MEX by counting unique elements, which is not aligned with the game rules.

4. **Returning the MEX**:
   - The original program returns the first `i` where the conditions are met, which does not reflect the actual game state.

### Correct Approach

To correctly simulate the game, we need to follow these steps:
1. Read the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.
2. Simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice picks elements not already chosen by Bob.
3. Build the array `c` with Alice's choices.
4. Calculate the MEX of the array `c`.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize counters
    alice_choices = []
    bob_choices = []
    
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    while i < N and j < N:
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            if a[i] not in bob_choices:
                alice_choices.append(a[i])
                a.pop(i)
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:  # Bob's turn
            if a[j] not in alice_choices:
                bob_choices.append(a[j])
                a.pop(j)
                j += 1
            else:
                j += 1
    
    # Calculate MEX of Alice's choices
    mex = 0
    seen = set(alice_choices)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Simulating Turns**:
   - Use two pointers `i` and `j` to simulate Alice's and Bob's turns.
   - Alice picks elements from `a` that are not already chosen by Bob.
   - Bob picks any remaining elements from `a`.

3. **Building Alice's Choices**:
   - Append Alice's choices to the `alice_choices` list.
   - Remove the chosen elements from `a`.

4. **Calculating MEX**:
   - Use a set to keep track of Alice's choices.
   - Iterate to find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the detailed analysis and the corrected implementation, the original program does not correctly simulate the game and does not return the correct MEX value. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

**Final: False**
