Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), another positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (each less than `n`). The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. It processes these inputs according to specified rules and returns a result for each test case.
