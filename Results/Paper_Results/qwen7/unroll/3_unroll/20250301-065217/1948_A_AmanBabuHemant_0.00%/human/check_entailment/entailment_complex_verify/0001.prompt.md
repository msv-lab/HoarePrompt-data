You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. For each iteration of the loop:
    #- If the input integer `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.
    #- If `n` is even and less than 400, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times, but only if the length of `s` is less than 200. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 50 test cases, each involving an integer `n`. For each `n`, it checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and the resulting string `s` (consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times) is less than 200 characters, it outputs 'YES' followed by `s`; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking Parity of `n`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (as explained in the problem statement).

3. **Generating the String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a string `s` with the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)`.
   - This pattern creates a sequence where every third character is different from its neighbors, making them special.
   - The program then checks if the generated string `s` has a length less than 200.
   - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string `s`.
   - If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO".

### Issues Identified

1. **Pattern Generation:**
   - The pattern `'110' * (n // 2)` does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters but instead uses digits (`1`, `0`). This violates the problem constraints which require the string to consist of uppercase Latin letters.

2. **Special Character Definition:**
   - The pattern `'110'` does not necessarily create exactly `n` special characters. For example, if `n = 4`, the generated string would be `"1101"`, which has only 2 special characters (positions 2 and 4), not 4.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program should output "YES" followed by a suitable string or "NO" if no suitable string exists. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the generated string meets the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters.

### Correct Solution Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate a string that meets the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters. Here’s a revised approach:

1. **Generate a Pattern:**
   - Use a pattern like `"ABAC"` which ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, creating special characters.
   - Repeat this pattern until the desired length is achieved.

2. **Ensure Length Constraint:**
   - Ensure the generated string does not exceed 200 characters.

3. **Check Special Characters:**
   - Verify that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters.

### Revised Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Generate a pattern with special characters
            pattern = 'ABAC'
            s = ''
            while len(s) < 200:
                s += pattern
                if len(s) >= n:
                    break
            # Trim the string to the required length
            s = s[:n]
            # Check if the string has exactly n special characters
            special_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s[i] != s[(i + 1) % n])
            if special_count == n:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The revised program addresses these issues and should correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the original program is **Incorrect**.
