Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. For each iteration of the loop:
- If the input integer `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is even and less than 400, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times, but only if the length of `s` is less than 200. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
