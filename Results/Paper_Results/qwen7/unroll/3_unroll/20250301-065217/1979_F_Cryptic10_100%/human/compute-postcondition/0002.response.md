Output State: **t** test cases, each with a sequence of integers printed in a specific order after performing a series of operations. The operations involve removing elements from a set and recording the operations in a list. After processing, the remaining elements and the recorded operations are used to reconstruct the original sequence or a modified version of it, which is then printed in reverse order.
