Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. This means the loop will continue until the user inputs a non-positive integer.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**: 
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `int(input())` determines whether the loop continues. Therefore, the state of `int(input())` must be such that it returns a positive integer.

4. **Consider the constraints**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `q` is a lambda function that prints `'? %d' % d` followed by reading a line of input split into integers and returning them as a map object. However, this function is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

Given these points, the key state adjustment needed is ensuring that `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Since the loop will continue as long as the input is positive, we need to ensure that the input is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input to `int(input())` such that it returns a positive integer.

**State:**
**`int(input())` must return a positive integer**
