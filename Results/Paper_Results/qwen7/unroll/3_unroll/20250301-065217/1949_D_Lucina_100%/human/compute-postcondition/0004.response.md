Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - The variable `i` should be set to 1 initially because the loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - The variable `n` should be such that the loop can execute, meaning `n` must be at least 1.

4. **List the adjusted states**: Based on the above points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
