The function processes an n x n grid (where n is between 2 and 24) containing undecided ('?'), funny ('F'), and scary ('S') transition video characters. It determines the type of transition video needed for each undecided position based on the surrounding cells. If a cell is already decided (either 'F' or 'S'), it keeps that decision. For undecided positions, it decides whether to use a funny ('F') or scary ('S') video based on the majority of surrounding decisions. If the number of undecided positions is greater, it uses more 'F' videos; otherwise, it uses more 'S' videos. The function outputs a new n x n grid with the determined transition videos for all positions.
