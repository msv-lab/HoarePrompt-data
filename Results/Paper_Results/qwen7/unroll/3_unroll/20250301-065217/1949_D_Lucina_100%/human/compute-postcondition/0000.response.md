Output State: **n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and n is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the input is guaranteed to be within the range of 2 to 24, the precondition that `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24 remains valid. The value of `n` is updated to the input integer, and all other variables remain unchanged.
