Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 1 (since the loop starts with `i` in the range `1` to `n+1`).
   - The variable `n` represents the upper limit of the loop, which is the length of the lists `sa` and `sb`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` should start at 1.
   - The variable `n` should be set to the length of `sa` (or equivalently `sb` since they are of the same length).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `sa` (or `sb`)**.
