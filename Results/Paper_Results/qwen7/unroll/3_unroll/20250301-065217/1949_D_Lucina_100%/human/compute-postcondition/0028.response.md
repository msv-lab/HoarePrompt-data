Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating the type of transition video needed for each undecided position in the n x n grid, where n is an integer between 2 and 24. If a position is already decided (F or S), it returns the corresponding character. For undecided positions (?), it determines whether a funny (F) or scary (S) video is needed based on the surrounding cells.**

This means the function processes a grid of size n x n, where each cell can either be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '.', or '?'. The function needs to decide the type of transition video ('F' or 'S') for each '?' based on the surrounding cells, ensuring no more than half of the total cells have a decision made. If a cell is already decided, the function returns that character. If a cell is undecided, the function decides based on the majority of the surrounding cells.
