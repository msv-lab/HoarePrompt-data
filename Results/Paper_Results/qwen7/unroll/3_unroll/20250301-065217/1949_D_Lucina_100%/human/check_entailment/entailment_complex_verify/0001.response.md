### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to fill in the undecided transition videos (`?`) in a way that no matter the order of scenarios, no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type (`F` or `S`) appear.
   - The input guarantees that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transitions are already decided.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the input and processes it to count the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario.
   - It then categorizes scenarios into two lists: `sa` for those with more `F` transitions and `sb` for those with more `S` transitions.
   - If `sa` is longer than or equal to `sb`, it fills in the undecided transitions (`?`) by favoring `F` for scenarios in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) positions of `sa`.
   - Otherwise, it favors `S` for scenarios in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) positions of `sb`.

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The code incorrectly categorizes scenarios into `sa` and `sb` based on the number of `F` and `S` transitions. This is flawed because it should consider the balance of `F` and `S` transitions across all pairs, not just individual scenarios.
   - The logic for filling in the undecided transitions (`?`) is overly simplistic and does not ensure the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive `F` or `S` transitions is met for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The code does not account for the fact that the distribution of `F` and `S` transitions needs to be balanced across all pairs, not just individual scenarios.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the distribution of `F` and `S` transitions is balanced across all pairs of scenarios. This involves a more complex algorithm that considers the entire matrix of transitions rather than just individual scenarios.
   - A correct approach would involve:
     - Counting the total number of `F` and `S` transitions.
     - Ensuring that the difference between the number of `F` and `S` transitions is minimized.
     - Using a greedy or dynamic programming approach to fill in the undecided transitions while maintaining the balance.

5. **Evaluation of the Given Code:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the necessary logic to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios.
   - The categorization of `sa` and `sb` based on individual scenarios is insufficient and does not guarantee the required balance across all pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to ensure the required constraint is met for all possible permutations of scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
