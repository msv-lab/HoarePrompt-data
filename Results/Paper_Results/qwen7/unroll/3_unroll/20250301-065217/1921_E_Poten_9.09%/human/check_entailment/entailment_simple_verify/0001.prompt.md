You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

The length of the list is equal to the value of `test_cases`, which is an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. Each element in the list corresponds to the result ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') of the evaluation for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input into individual variables representing the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Base Case:**
   - The program checks if Alice's initial row position `x_a` is greater than Bob's initial row position `x_b` or if Alice is in the last row (`x_a == h`). In these cases, it immediately appends "Draw" to the answers list. This part is correct.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The program checks the parity (even or odd nature) of the initial row positions of Alice and Bob. This is relevant because the game dynamics depend on whether the starting positions are even or odd.
   - If both starting positions are even or both are odd, the program proceeds to further checks. This part is also correct.

4. **Special Cases for Initial Column Positions:**
   - The program handles special cases where Alice and Bob start in the same column. If they start in the same column, the program correctly determines the winner based on the relative row positions. This logic seems to handle this scenario correctly.

5. **General Case:**
   - For the general case, the program makes decisions based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob, considering the constraints of their movements. The logic here is complex but seems to cover most scenarios.
   - The program uses the absolute difference between the row positions and the relative column positions to determine if a player can force a win or if the game results in a draw.

6. **Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case after processing all test cases.

### Analysis of Test Cases:

Given the complexity of the logic and the detailed handling of different scenarios, we need to verify the correctness against the provided test cases. The test cases cover various edge cases and typical scenarios, which helps in validating the program.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided test cases, the program appears to handle all the specified scenarios correctly. The logic is sound and covers all the necessary conditions for determining the game outcome.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
