Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

    #State: Output State: `distances` is a list containing the distance of all nodes from the starting node, each distance is represented as a number indicating the path length from the start node, and no node is listed more than once unless it has multiple paths of different lengths from the start node. The `nodes` dictionary remains unchanged, `start` remains as the initial node index, and `parent` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

    #The program returns the list `distances` which contains the distance of all nodes from the starting node, each distance is represented as a number indicating the path length from the start node, and no node is listed more than once unless it has multiple paths of different lengths from the start node.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an edge between nodes u and v, and start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the starting node for the first round.

There either exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd, or all moves in `moves` are even numbers.
