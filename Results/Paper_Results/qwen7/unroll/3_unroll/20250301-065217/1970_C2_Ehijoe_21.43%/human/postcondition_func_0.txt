The function `func_1` takes a tree structure represented as a dictionary `nodes`, an initial node index `start`, and an optional parent node index `parent`. It returns a list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. If the starting node has only one neighbor and that neighbor is the parent, it returns a list containing the single element 0. Otherwise, it calculates the distances recursively for each neighbor of the starting node (excluding the parent) and compiles these distances into a final list to return.
