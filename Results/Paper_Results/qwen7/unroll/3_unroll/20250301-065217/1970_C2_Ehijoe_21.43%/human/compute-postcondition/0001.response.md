Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, and `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code initializes `edges` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `t`, and `start` are updated from their initial state to the integer inputs provided, while `edges` is explicitly set to an empty list.
