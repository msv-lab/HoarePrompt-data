### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array.
- If there are no such segments, it outputs `-1`.
- Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length found.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
       ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and the array for each test case.

2. **Main Logic**:
   ```python
   same = 1
   num = ar[0]
   minn = inf
   i = 1
   while i < len(ar):
       if ar[i] == num:
           same += 1
       else:
           i += 1
           num = ar[i]
           minn = min(minn, same)
           same = 1
       i += 1
   minn = min(minn, same)
   ```

   - The variable `same` keeps track of the length of the current segment of consecutive elements.
   - `num` stores the current element being checked.
   - `minn` stores the minimum length of any segment found.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` accordingly.

3. **Output**:
   ```python
   if minn == inf:
       print(-1)
   else:
       print(minn)
   ```

   - If `minn` remains `inf`, it means there were no segments of consecutive elements, so the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the output is the minimum length of any segment found.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value, but it does not correctly determine the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.
- The logic to find the minimum number of removals is flawed. It only finds the minimum length of any segment, but it does not consider the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `-1`

The program incorrectly sets `minn` to infinity and does not properly handle the logic to find the minimum number of removals needed. It should identify that removing the element at index `2` (value `1`) makes the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful. The logic in the program does not accurately determine the minimum number of removals required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
