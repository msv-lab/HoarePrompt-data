Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array. However, the logic in the program does not correctly determine whether the array can become non-beautiful by removing elements. The program incorrectly calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments and outputs this value as the answer, which does not address the actual requirement of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Segments**: The program tries to find the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value but does not consider the condition required to make the array non-beautiful. Specifically, it should look for the smallest segment where removing one element would break the beauty property.

2. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The program outputs the minimum length of consecutive segments as the answer, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The program fails to account for the specific operation defined in the problem statement.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs `1` because it finds the minimum length of consecutive segments (which is `1`), but the correct answer should be `1` since removing the middle `2` makes the array non-beautiful.
   - For the input `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program outputs `3` because it finds the minimum length of consecutive segments (which is `3`), but the correct answer should be `3` since removing the first three elements makes the array non-beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
