Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the call to `int(input())`. 

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. It is used to iterate over the number of test cases.
   - The call to `int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which determines how many times the loop will run.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the one that will be read by `int(input())`. This integer will determine the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is a valid integer within the specified range for the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`input` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ input ≤ 10^4**
