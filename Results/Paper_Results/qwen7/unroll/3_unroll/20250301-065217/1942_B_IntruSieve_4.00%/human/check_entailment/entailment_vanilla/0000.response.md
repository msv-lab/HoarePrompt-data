Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a` for each test case.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the MEX value for each position.
   - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` to the `mex` list.
   - It updates `maxx` if the calculated MEX value is greater than the current `maxx`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the values in the `mex` list, which should represent the permutation `p`.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating MEX seems correct. It ensures that the MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation.
  - However, the program does not actually construct the permutation `p` but instead constructs a list `mex` that should match the MEX values as defined in the problem.

- **Permutation Construction:**
  - The program does not explicitly construct the permutation `p` from the `mex` list. Instead, it directly prints the `mex` values.
  - According to the problem, the `mex` values should be used to construct the permutation `p`, but the program does not do this.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles both positive and negative values in `arr` correctly.
  - It ensures that `minn` and `maxx` are updated appropriately to reflect the MEX values.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It constructs a list of MEX values (`mex`) instead of constructing the actual permutation `p`. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
