Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks if the number of extroverts (`b`) when divided by 3 leaves a remainder. If this remainder is not zero and the sum of the remaining extroverts and universals (`c`) is less than 3, the program correctly identifies that it's impossible to accommodate everyone and prints `-1`.
3. If the above condition is not met, the program calculates the number of tents required as follows:
   - `a + (b + c) // 3`: This accounts for each introvert needing a separate tent and each group of 3 people (extroverts and/or universals) needing one tent.
   - An additional tent is added if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, which ensures that any remaining people who cannot form a full group of 3 are also accommodated.
4. The program logic matches the problem statement and correctly implements the conditions to determine the minimum number of tents needed or whether it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
