Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, the first row of the grid (`a`), and the second row of the grid (`b`).

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `b[-2] != '>'`, the program immediately prints 'NO'. This check ensures that the last two cells in the second row cannot both point to the left, which would prevent reaching the last column.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'YES'. This is a special case where the robot only needs to move down to reach the target cell `(2, 1)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - A variable `no_path` is set to `True` initially.
   - The program iterates through the second row (`b`) in steps of 2, checking if the arrow points to the right (`>`). If any arrow does not point to the right, `no_path` is set to `False`.
   - Another loop iterates through the first row (`a`) in steps of 2, checking if the arrow points to the right (`>`). If any arrow does not point to the right, `no_path` is set to `False`.
   - After these checks, if `no_path` is still `True`, the program prints 'YES', indicating a path exists. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by printing 'YES'.
   - However, it should also handle the case when `n == 2` separately, as the initial check `if b[-2] != '>'` will fail but the robot can still reach the target.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic for determining if a path exists is flawed. The program assumes that if any arrow does not point to the right, no path exists. This is not always true. For example, consider the grid:
     ```
     >>
     <>
     ```
     Here, `b[-2] == '<'`, so the program would incorrectly print 'NO'. However, the robot can still reach the target by moving down from `(1, 2)` to `(2, 2)`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the robot can move back and forth between the rows, potentially reaching the target cell.

### Corrected Approach:
A more robust approach would involve simulating the robot's movement and checking if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain edge cases and has a flawed logic for determining if a path exists.

**Correctness: **False**
