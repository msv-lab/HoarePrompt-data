State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(cases)` will execute as long as `cases` is greater than 0.
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition but is mentioned in the initial state. It is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `cases` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is set to 0, and `t` is already defined as a positive integer within the specified range.
