Output State: The output state will consist of three lowercase letters printed for each iteration of the outer loop, based on the value of `lex` after processing. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it will be decremented by 1 and appended as 1, otherwise, it will be decremented by 26 and appended as 26. After the inner loops, `lex` is appended to the list `arr`, which is then sorted before printing the first three elements converted to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. This process repeats for each case provided by the user.
