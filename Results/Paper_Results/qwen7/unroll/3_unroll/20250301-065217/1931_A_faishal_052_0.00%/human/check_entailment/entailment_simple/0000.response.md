Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program reads the encoded integer `lex` for each test case.
   - It then attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by breaking down `lex` into parts that correspond to the positions of letters in the alphabet.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically:
     - The condition `if lex <= 26:` and `elif lex < 52:` do not cover all possible values of `lex`. For instance, `lex` can be greater than 52, which is not handled correctly.
     - The program incorrectly appends `26` to `arr` multiple times without properly reducing `lex` by the appropriate amount.
     - The final `arr.append(lex)` does not make sense in the context of constructing the smallest word.

3. **Constructing the Word**:
   - After the loop, the array `arr` is sorted, which is unnecessary since we are trying to construct the smallest word.
   - The program then prints characters corresponding to the values in `arr`, but the logic for determining these values is incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process. It fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for most test cases.

Correctness: **False**
