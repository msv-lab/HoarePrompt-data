Output State: The output state will consist of three lowercase letters printed for each iteration of the outer loop, based on the value of `lex` after processing. Specifically, the first two characters will always be 'a' and 'z', and the third character will be a letter corresponding to the remaining value of `lex` after it has been reduced by multiples of 26. This process is repeated `cases` times.
