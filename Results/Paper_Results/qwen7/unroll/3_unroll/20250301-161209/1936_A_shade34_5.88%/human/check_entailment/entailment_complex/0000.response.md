Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum XOR Value**:
   - The program starts by comparing `p_mak` with `p_i` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`. It uses the bitwise OR operation to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. This step ensures that `mak` is set to the index `i` where the OR operation results in the highest value compared to `p_mak | p_mak`. This is a reasonable approach to find a candidate for the maximum XOR value.

3. **Finding Additional Indices**:
   - The program then iterates through all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` to find additional indices that could potentially maximize the XOR value. It compares `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`. If the result is less than, it updates `mak` and stores the index `i` in `pans`. If the result is equal, it appends the index `i` to `pans`.

4. **Refining the Indices**:
   - The program then refines the indices by comparing pairs within `pans` to ensure that the final `mak` is the index that maximizes the XOR value when paired with `mak2`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices `mak2` and `mak` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for finding the initial candidate (`mak`) for the maximum XOR value is sound. It leverages the properties of the OR operation to identify a potential high-value index.
- The subsequent steps of refining the indices and ensuring the correct pair are also logically sound and aim to maximize the XOR value.
- The program adheres to the constraint of making at most `3n` queries.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps in the program, the provided code appears to be correct and should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
