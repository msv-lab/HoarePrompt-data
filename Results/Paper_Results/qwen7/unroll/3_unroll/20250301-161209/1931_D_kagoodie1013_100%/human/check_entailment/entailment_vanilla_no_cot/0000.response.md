Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using the `func_1` function. The implementation uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues of array elements with respect to `x` and `y`, which helps in efficiently counting the pairs that satisfy the conditions. The overall structure and logic of the code match the requirements of the problem.
