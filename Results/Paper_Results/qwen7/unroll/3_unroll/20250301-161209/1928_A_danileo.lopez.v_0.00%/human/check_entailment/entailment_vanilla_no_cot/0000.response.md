Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1, which results in a single 1x1 square that cannot be cut further.
2. **Even Sides Check**: The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes' because cutting along the even side will result in at least one rectangle that can be rearranged to form another rectangle. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'No' because cutting an odd-sized rectangle will always result in two smaller odd-sized rectangles, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle without a 90-degree rotation.
3. **Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Given the logic and the examples provided, the program works as intended and thus is correct.
