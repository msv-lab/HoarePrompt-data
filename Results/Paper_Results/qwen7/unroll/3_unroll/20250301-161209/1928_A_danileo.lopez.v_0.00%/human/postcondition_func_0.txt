The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if at least one of the integers \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If so, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, it outputs a total of \(t\) lines, where \(t\) is the number of test cases provided.
