Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. Based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, the function calculates and prints an integer for each test case. Specifically, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1`. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus `a * n`.**
