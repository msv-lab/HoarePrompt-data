Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers. For each test case specified by the initial integer `t`, the output will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as follows:
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output will be `n * a`.
- If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output will be the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2b - n + 1`, which can be calculated as `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
- Otherwise, the output will be the sum of the first `b - a` natural numbers plus `a * n`, which can be calculated as `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`.
