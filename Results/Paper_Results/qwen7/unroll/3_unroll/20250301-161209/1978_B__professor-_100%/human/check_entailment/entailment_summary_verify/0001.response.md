### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can make by selling `n` buns under the given promotion rules.
   - Bob can choose an integer `k` (where \(0 \le k \le \min(n, b)\)), and the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins for the `i-th` bun.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - It then checks different conditions to calculate the maximum profit:
     - If `b <= a`, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` gives the maximum profit.
     - If `b - a >= n`, it means selling the first `n` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price gives the maximum profit.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the profit by selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.

3. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The condition `if b <= a` correctly identifies when selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal.
   - The condition `elif b - a >= n` correctly identifies when selling the first `n` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price is optimal.
   - The condition `else` calculates the profit for the general case where `k` is chosen optimally.

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The formula used in the code is correct for calculating the profit:
     - For the first `k` buns, the total profit is \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)\), which simplifies to \(\frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}\).
     - For the remaining `n - k` buns, the total profit is \((n - k) \times a\).

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the conditions and the formulas used in the code.
   - The formula \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\) in the `elif` block is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `2b - n + 1` and the number of terms is `n`.
   - The formula \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\) in the `else` block is derived from the sum of the first `(b - a)` natural numbers plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and the function summary, we can see that the conditions and the profit calculations are correct. The code correctly handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
