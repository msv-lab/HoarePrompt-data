Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It then calculates the total number of shapes that can be formed using these sticks, where each shape requires three sticks of the same length. The function outputs the total number of such shapes for each test case.**
