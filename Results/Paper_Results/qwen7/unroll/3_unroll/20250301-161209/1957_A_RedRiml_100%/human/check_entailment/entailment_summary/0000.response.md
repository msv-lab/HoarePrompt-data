Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
- It then counts the occurrences of each stick length and determines how many regular polygons (triangles) can be formed from these sticks.
- The logic to calculate the number of polygons is correct. Specifically, for each unique stick length, the program divides the count of that length by 3 and sums these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.
- The program handles the constraints and requirements as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
