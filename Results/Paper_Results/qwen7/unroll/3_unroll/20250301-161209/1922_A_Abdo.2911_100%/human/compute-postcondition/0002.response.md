Output State: **The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If for any iteration 'possible' is set to True, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final state will be determined by the last printed output after all iterations.**
