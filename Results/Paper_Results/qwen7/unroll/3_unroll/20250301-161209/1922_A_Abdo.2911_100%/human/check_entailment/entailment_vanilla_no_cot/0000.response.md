Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in determining whether a template exists that satisfies the conditions. Specifically, the logic for checking if `c` can match the template while `a` and `b` do not is incorrect.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Template Matching:**
   - The current implementation only checks if `c` differs from both `a` and `b` at some positions but does not correctly handle the template constraints.
   - The variable `possible` is set to `True` if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` when `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

2. **Template Constraint Violation:**
   - The template should ensure that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not. The current implementation does not properly enforce these constraints.

### Corrected Program:
To correctly determine if a valid template exists, we need to construct the template character by character based on the characters in `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            elif a[i].islower() and b[i].isupper() and a[i] != c[i] and b[i].lower() != c[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            elif a[i].isupper() and b[i].islower() and a[i].lower() != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                template.append(b[i])
            else:
                template.append('?')  # If no valid character can be determined, mark it as '?'
        
        # Check if the template is valid
        valid_template = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i] != '?' and (template[i] == a[i] or template[i] == b[i]):
                if template[i] == c[i]:
                    valid_template = False
                    break
            elif template[i] == '?':
                if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                    valid_template = False
                    break
        
        if valid_template:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This corrected program constructs the template character by character and ensures that the template meets the required conditions. It then checks if the constructed template is valid according to the given constraints.
