Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes values within specified ranges for t, n, a, b, and c. It validates that t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 20 inclusive, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters when called. Instead, it implicitly expects certain conditions to be met regarding the values of variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` which should be set before calling the function. The function checks if `t` is an integer within the range [1, 1000], `n` is an integer within the range [1, 20], and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If these conditions are satisfied, the function processes these values as intended.
