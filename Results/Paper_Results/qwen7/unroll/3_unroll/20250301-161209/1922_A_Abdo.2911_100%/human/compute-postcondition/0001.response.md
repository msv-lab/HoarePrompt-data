Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Maintain Other States**: The states of `a`, `b`, and `c` should remain as they are because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters**
