Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1` to check the conditions for a possible template.
4. The logic checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same:
   - If they are the same, it checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, it checks if `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
5. After checking all positions, if `possible` is still `False`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
6. This logic correctly follows the problem statement and handles all given examples.

Correctness: **True**
