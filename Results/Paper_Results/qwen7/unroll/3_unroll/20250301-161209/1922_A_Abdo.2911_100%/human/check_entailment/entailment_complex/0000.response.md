Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the length `n` of the strings and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - For each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the function checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same.
   - If they are the same and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop since this satisfies the condition for `a` and `b` matching the template but `c` not matching.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the function checks if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If it is, the function continues to the next character; otherwise, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no character violates the conditions, the function prints 'NO'.

3. **Output Handling**: The function correctly prints 'YES' if a valid template is found for the current test case and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function accurately implements the required logic without any errors. Therefore, the provided function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
