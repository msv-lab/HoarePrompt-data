### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the provided program. The program attempts to find the maximum and minimum values in the array and calculates the difference, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty as defined in the problem statement. The beauty is calculated as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Sorting the array ensures that the differences are maximized because the largest and smallest values are placed next to each other, leading to the largest possible differences.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This corrected program works as follows:
1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. Sorts the array `nums`.
4. Calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
5. Prints the calculated beauty.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Calculated beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Actual Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Sorted array: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Calculated beauty: `0`
  - Actual Output: `0`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Expected Output: `57`
  - Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Calculated beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
  - Actual Output: `57`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Sorted array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Calculated beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
  - Actual Output: `1`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2]`
  - Calculated beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
  - Actual Output: `1`

The corrected program produces the correct results for all test cases.
