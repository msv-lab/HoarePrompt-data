You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; l is an integer; nums is a list of integers; x and y are integers with their final values determined by the loop; no other variables are defined or changed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Two variables `x` and `y` are initialized to `0` and `100000000` respectively. These variables are intended to keep track of the maximum and minimum values in the array.

3. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - The program iterates through the array and updates `x` and `y` with the maximum and minimum values found in the array.
   - This logic is flawed because it only considers one element at a time and does not ensure that `x` is the maximum and `y` is the minimum after the loop completes.

4. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After finding `x` and `y`, the program calculates the difference `x - y` and prints it as the result.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty of the array.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** 
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Actual Output: `1` (since `max(2, 1, 3) - min(2, 1, 3) = 3 - 1 = 2`, but the program outputs `2 - 1 = 1`)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Actual Output: `0` (correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Expected Output: `57`
  - Actual Output: `57` (correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Actual Output: `1` (correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Actual Output: `1` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. It only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty as defined in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

The correct solution should involve rearranging the array to maximize the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})`. This typically involves sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
