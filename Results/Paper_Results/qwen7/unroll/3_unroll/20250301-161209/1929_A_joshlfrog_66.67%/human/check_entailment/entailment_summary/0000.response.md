Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum possible "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- The given solution only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array (`x - y`). This approach does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array.
- To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. Rearranging the array such that the largest values are placed at the beginning and the smallest values at the end would achieve this.
- However, the current implementation simply finds the max and min values without considering the arrangement of the array elements. It does not sort or rearrange the array to maximize the beauty.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
