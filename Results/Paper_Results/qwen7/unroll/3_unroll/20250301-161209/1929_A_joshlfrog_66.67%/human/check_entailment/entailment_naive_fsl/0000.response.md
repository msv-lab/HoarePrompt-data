Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program aims to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty according to the given formula.

To maximize the beauty, we need to arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The current implementation simply finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates their difference, which may not yield the highest possible beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
3
10 20 10
```
The program would output `10` (since `max - min = 20 - 10 = 10`), but the correct output should be `10` (by arranging the array as `[10, 20, 10]`, the beauty is `(20-10) + (10-20) = 10`).

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
