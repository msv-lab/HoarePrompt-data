Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the maximum and minimum values in the array and calculates their difference, which is not the correct approach for maximizing the beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This ensures that the largest numbers are paired with the smallest numbers to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This program first sorts the array and then computes the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which correctly maximizes the beauty according to the problem's definition.
