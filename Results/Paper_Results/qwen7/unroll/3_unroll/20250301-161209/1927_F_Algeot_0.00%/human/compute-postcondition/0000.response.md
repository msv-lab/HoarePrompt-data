Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the recursion limit is set to 10 ** 6**.

Explanation: The code sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\) using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This changes the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack to \(10^6\). The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
