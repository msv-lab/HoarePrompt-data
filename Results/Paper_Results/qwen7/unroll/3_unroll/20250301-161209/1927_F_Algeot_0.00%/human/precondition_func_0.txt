t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n-1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), and the subsequent m lines contain three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices and the sum of m for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
