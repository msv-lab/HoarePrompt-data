Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block with no free cells between them, minimizing the number of moves.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement this logic. Specifically, the program attempts to find the first and last positions of '1' (chips) in the string representation of the array and then counts the zeros between these positions. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of moves required to achieve the desired configuration.
3. The program fails to consider the correct strategy for moving chips. Instead of counting zeros directly, it should simulate the process of moving chips to the left until they form a single block.
4. The correct approach would involve iterating through the array and counting how many chips need to be moved to the leftmost possible position to form a continuous block.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
