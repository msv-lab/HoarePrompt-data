Output State: **`a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the number of stones in each of the n piles, where n is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than 2, and `winNext` is the result of calling `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_2` with two arguments: `a[1:]`, which is the list `a` excluding its first element, and `n - 1`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than 2 (which means `n` is 2), `n - 1` is 1. The value of `winNext` is the result of this function call, but the exact value depends on the implementation of `func_2`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` is not directly used in the given code snippet, so its value remains as per the initial state.
