Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where some edges are missing. The graph is initially complete, but exactly \(n-2\) edges are removed. We can query the degree of vertices and find non-existent edges to reconstruct the graph and identify a Hamiltonian path.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a set of vertices and an operations list.
   - It enters a loop until the set of vertices has 2 or fewer elements.
     - It queries the degree of vertices and identifies a vertex with the minimum degree and its non-existent edge.
     - It removes the identified vertex and records the operation.
   - Once the set has 2 or fewer elements, it reconstructs the Hamiltonian path by reversing the operations and printing the result.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly handles the removal of vertices and recording of operations.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed by reversing the operations and including the remaining vertices.
   - The logic for querying and removing vertices is sound and follows the problem's constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the graph is reduced to 2 vertices directly.
   - It correctly identifies and removes vertices with the minimum degree and handles the case where no non-existent edge is found.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function formats the output correctly as specified, ensuring the path is printed in the required format.

Given the analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the solution for finding a Hamiltonian path under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
