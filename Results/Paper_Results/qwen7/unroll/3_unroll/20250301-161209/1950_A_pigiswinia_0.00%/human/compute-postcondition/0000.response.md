Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (a, b, and c) are not affected by this code snippet.
