Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   
2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation:**
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`):
     - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it uses the promotion price for pairs of yogurts and buys the last yogurt at the regular price: `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`):
     - It directly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying them at the regular price (`a`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so it calculates the total cost as `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it uses the promotion price for all pairs of yogurts: `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.
   - It considers the promotion price for buying pairs of yogurts and compares it with the regular price to minimize the cost.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so use the promotion price: `2 * 9 = 18` (but since we're buying 2, it's actually `9`).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`, so use the promotion price for pairs and regular price for the last: `1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14`.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so use the regular price for all: `3 * 5 = 15`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, we check `2 * a < b`:
    - `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`, so use the regular price for all: `4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly handles all these cases.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
