Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where it's more advantageous to buy two yogurts at the promotion price even when `n` is even. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is odd and then compares `2 * a` with `b`, but it fails to consider the scenario where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.

For example, consider the input:
```
2 5 10
```
Here, `n = 2`, `a = 5`, and `b = 10`. The correct minimum cost should be `10` (since buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as `2 * 5 = 10` for even `n` without considering the promotion price.

To fix this, the program should always check if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper before deciding the cost. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a)

func()
```

This version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for both odd and even values of `n`.
