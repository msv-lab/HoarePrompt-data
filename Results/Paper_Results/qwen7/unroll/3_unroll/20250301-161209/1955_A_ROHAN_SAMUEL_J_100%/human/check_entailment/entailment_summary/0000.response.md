Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic in the function matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - If \( n \) is odd, the best strategy is to compare the cost of buying all yogurts individually (\( a \times n \)) with the cost of buying as many pairs as possible plus one additional yogurt (\( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times b + a \)).
   - If \( n \) is even, the best strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs (\( \frac{n}{2} \times b \)) unless the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price is cheaper than the promotional price for two yogurts (\( 2a < b \)), in which case buying all yogurts individually would be cheaper.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function correctly handles the input processing and looping through each test case.
   - It correctly identifies whether \( n \) is odd or even.
   - For odd \( n \):
     - It compares \( 2a \) with \( b \).
     - If \( 2a < b \), it prints \( a \times n \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \times b + a \).
   - For even \( n \):
     - It directly calculates the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs (\( \frac{n}{2} \times b \)) if \( 2a \geq b \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( a \times n \).

3. **Examples Verification**:
   - For the first test case (2 5 9): \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \). Since \( n \) is even and \( 2a = 10 > b \), the output is \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \). However, the expected output is 9, indicating an error in the function's logic for even \( n \).
   - For the second test case (3 5 9): \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \). Since \( n \) is odd and \( 2a = 10 > b \), the output is \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \). This matches the expected output.
   - For the third test case (3 5 11): \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \). Since \( n \) is odd and \( 2a = 10 < b \), the output is \( \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor \times 11 + 5 = 15 \). This matches the expected output.
   - For the fourth test case (4 5 11): \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \). Since \( n \) is even and \( 2a = 10 < b \), the output is \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \). This matches the expected output.

Given that the function fails to handle the even \( n \) case correctly, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
