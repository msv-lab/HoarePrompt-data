### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, a)` is designed to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of integers that appear exactly twice (`pairs`).
   - Finally, it returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`.
   - This logic ensures that you can only score points if there is a matching card on the table, and it maximizes your score while minimizing Nene's score.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n` and the list `a`, then calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the result.
   - It collects all results in a list and prints each result after processing all test cases.
   - The function correctly handles the input format and ensures that the results are printed in the required order.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the maximum number of points you can get is calculated correctly based on the rules of the game.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the problem description and the example provided.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the game, based on the rules provided. Both functions work together to process the input and produce the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
