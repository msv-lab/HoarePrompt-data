Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (which is typically the console) and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but now there is a new variable `data` which contains the split input as a list of strings.
