Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with the first element being 1.**

Explanation: The initial state sets `A` to `True`, `not_c` to `False`, and `set_` to a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with the first element being 1. The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` to the opposite of its current value. Since `A` was initially `True`, after executing `A = not A`, `A` becomes `False`. The values of `not_c` and `set_` remain unchanged.
