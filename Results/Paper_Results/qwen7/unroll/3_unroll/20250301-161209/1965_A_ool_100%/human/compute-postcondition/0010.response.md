Output State: `A` is True; `not_c` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1.

Explanation: 
- The loop iterates over the elements of `set_` starting from the second element (index 1) and checks the difference between consecutive elements.
- If the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to False and the loop breaks.
- The variable `A` is toggled (flipped) between True and False with each iteration of the loop.
- Since the loop starts from index 1, it will check the difference between `set_[1]` and `set_[0]`. If the difference is greater than 1, the loop will break immediately, setting `not_c` to False.
- If the difference is not greater than 1 for any pair of consecutive elements, `A` will toggle between True and False based on the number of iterations, which will result in `A` being True after an even number of iterations or False after an odd number of iterations. Given the loop starts from index 1 and iterates up to `len(set_) - 1`, if `set_` has an even number of elements, `A` will end up as True (since it starts as False and toggles an even number of times). If `set_` has an odd number of elements, `A` would end up as False, but since we don't know the exact number of elements in `set_`, we can only say it ends as True based on the provided information.
