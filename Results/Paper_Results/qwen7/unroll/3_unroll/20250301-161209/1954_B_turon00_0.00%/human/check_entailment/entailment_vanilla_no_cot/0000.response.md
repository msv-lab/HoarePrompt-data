Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Beauty**: The code checks if all elements are the same and prints `-1` if they are. However, the problem requires removing elements to break the beauty condition, not just checking if all elements are identical.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**: The code attempts to count consecutive identical elements and find the minimum count, but this does not address the requirement of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements. It only considers sequences of identical elements without considering the operations allowed to break the beauty condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical through the allowed operations and then calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break this sequence.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Find the longest sequence that can be made identical
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        prev_val = a[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] == prev_val:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
            prev_val = a[i]
        
        # If the entire array can be made identical, it's already beautiful
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of removals
            min_removals = n - max_length
            print(min_removals)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected approach:
1. Identifies the longest sequence of identical elements.
2. Checks if the entire array can be made identical (in which case it's already beautiful).
3. Calculates the minimum number of removals required to break this sequence.

This should correctly solve the problem as per the given requirements.
