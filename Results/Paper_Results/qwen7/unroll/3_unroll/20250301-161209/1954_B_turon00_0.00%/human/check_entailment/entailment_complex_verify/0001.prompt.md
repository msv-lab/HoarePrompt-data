You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `t` test cases are processed, and for each test case, the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element in the list `a` is printed. If all elements in the list `a` are the same, `-1` is printed instead.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, an integer n, and a list of n integers a. For each test case, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements in the list a that are equal to the first element. If all elements in the list a are the same, it prints -1 instead.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same (`len(set(a)) == 1`). If so, it prints `-1` because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made un-beautiful by removing elements.
   
3. **Finding Minimum Removals:**
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - It uses a set `aa` to get unique elements in the array.
   - If there is only one unique element, it means the array is already beautiful, and it prints `-1`.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are equal to `tmp`.
   - It updates `cnt` to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updates `ans` to store the minimum length of such segments.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `ans`, which should be the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling All Identical Elements:**
   - The program correctly identifies arrays with all identical elements and prints `-1` as required.

2. **Finding Minimum Removals:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of removals seems correct. It counts consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and keeps track of the minimum length of such segments. This approach ensures that we find the smallest segment that needs to be removed to break the beauty condition.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already beautiful correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the array has different elements and calculates the minimum number of removals accurately.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It handles all test cases as described and provides the correct output.
