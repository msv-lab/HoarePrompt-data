Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals**: The program calculates the number of tents required but does not fully respect the constraints for accommodating the participants. Specifically, the logic for handling the remaining universals after placing extroverts is flawed.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the remaining participants cannot form complete groups of 3. For example, in the test case `1 4 1`, the program incorrectly prints `-1` when it should print `3`.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # Tents for introverts
        k += a
        
        # Tents for extroverts and universals
        remaining_people = b + c
        if remaining_people >= 3:
            k += remaining_people // 3
            remaining_people %= 3
        
        # Handle remaining universals
        if remaining_people == 2:
            if b > 0:
                k += 1
                b -= 1
                remaining_people = 0
            else:
                k += 2
        elif remaining_people == 1:
            if b > 0:
                k += 1
                b -= 1
                remaining_people = 0
        
        # Check if it's possible to place the remaining extroverts
        if b > 0 and remaining_people == 0:
            if b % 3 != 0:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
        print(k)

func()
```

This corrected solution ensures that all participants are accommodated according to their preferences and handles edge cases properly.
