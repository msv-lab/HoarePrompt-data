Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for the exact distribution of tents required for different combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 2 1`
- Expected Output: `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts, and 1 tent for 1 universal)

However, the current implementation checks if `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` and prints `-1` in such cases. This condition is too restrictive and does not allow for the correct distribution of tents in many scenarios.

For instance, in the case of `1 2 1`, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 3 + 1 < 3`. However, we can still accommodate the participants as follows:
- 1 tent for the introvert (1 person).
- 1 tent for the 2 extroverts (2 persons).
- 1 tent for the remaining universal (1 person).

Thus, the program fails to provide the correct output for this case and similar scenarios, making it incorrect.
