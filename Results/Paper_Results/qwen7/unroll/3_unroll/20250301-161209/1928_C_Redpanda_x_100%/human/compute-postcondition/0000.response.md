Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9; `factors` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `factors`. This does not change the value of `n`, but it introduces a new variable `factors` which is an empty dictionary. Therefore, the output state includes both the unchanged value of `n` and the newly introduced empty dictionary `factors`.
