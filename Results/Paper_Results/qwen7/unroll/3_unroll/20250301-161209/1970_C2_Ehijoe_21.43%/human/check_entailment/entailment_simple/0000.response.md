Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree structure. The game is played for a single round, and the winner is determined based on the parity (odd/even) of the number of moves required to reach a leaf node from the starting node. If there is at least one odd move, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree using a recursive approach.
   - It correctly handles the base case where the node has only one neighbor (itself), returning `[0]`.
   - For other nodes, it recursively calculates the distances to all neighbors except the parent node and adds 1 to each distance.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input and constructs the tree representation using a dictionary (`nodes`).
   - It identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one neighbor) and stores them in a deque (`leaves`).
   - It reads the starting node and calls `func_1` to get the list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd. If so, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione".

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct for determining the winner based on the parity of the distances.
   - The overall flow of the program matches the problem description and requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
