Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing (u, v) pairs for each edge entered during the loop, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes based on the edges provided, `leaves` is a deque() instance.**

The code initializes a deque object named `leaves`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, `empty`, and `nodes` remain unchanged. A new variable `leaves` is introduced as a deque instance.
