Functionality: **The function reads the number of nodes \( n \), the number of edges \( t \) (which is fixed at 1), the edges of a tree, and a starting node. It then constructs a graph representation using a dictionary where each node points to its adjacent nodes. Next, it identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one adjacent node) and stores them in a deque. After that, it calls another function `func_1` to determine a sequence of moves starting from the specified node. Based on whether any move in the sequence is odd, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione". The function does not return any value.**
