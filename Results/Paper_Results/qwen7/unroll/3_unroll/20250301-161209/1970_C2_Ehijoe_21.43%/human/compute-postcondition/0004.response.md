Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop.
   - The loop runs from `range(n - 1)`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to `n-2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Loop Variable `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to set `i` to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

4. **Check Other Variables:**
   - `t` is 1, and it is not used in the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - `edges` is an empty list, and it is not used in the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `edges`.
   - `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), and it is not used in the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `start`.
   - `empty` is True, and it is not used in the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `empty`.
   - `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and it is not used in the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `nodes`.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 0, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
