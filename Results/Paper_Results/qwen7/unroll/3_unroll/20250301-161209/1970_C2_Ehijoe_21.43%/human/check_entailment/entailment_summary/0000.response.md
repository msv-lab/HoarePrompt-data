Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game played on a tree structure where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from one node to an adjacent inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played over multiple rounds, but here, only one round is specified with `t=1`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(nodes, start, parent=None)`**: This function computes the distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and calculate distances. However, this function is not directly used in `func_2`, so it seems unnecessary for the current problem.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, identifies leaf nodes, and then calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all other nodes. It checks if any of these distances are odd and determines the winner based on this condition.

3. **Game Strategy**:
   - In combinatorial game theory, the game of Nim-like games (where each move changes the state of the game) can be analyzed using the concept of Grundy numbers or Nim-sums. For a tree, the Grundy number of a node is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of its children. However, in this specific problem, the key insight is that if any distance from the starting node to another node is odd, Ron wins because he can always force a win by making a move that results in an even distance for Hermione, and vice versa.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly identifies the starting node and computes the distances to all other nodes.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd, which aligns with the game strategy described above.
   - The output is determined based on this check, which is correct for the given problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
