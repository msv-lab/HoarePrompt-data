Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9, after sorting, `arr` will contain these integers in ascending order. The values of `n` and the individual elements of `arr` are not specified, but they are now arranged in a sorted manner.
