Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, and two arrays a and b. For each test case, t represents the number of test cases, n and m represent positive integers, k is an even integer, and arrays a and b contain integers within specified ranges. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions given for n, m, and k, along with the contents of arrays a and b.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and arrays, and process them according to the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.
