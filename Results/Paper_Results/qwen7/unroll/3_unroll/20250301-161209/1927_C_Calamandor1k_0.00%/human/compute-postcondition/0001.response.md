Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute if `t` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: We need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range for the loop to execute. Given that `t` is a positive integer, we can confirm that the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
