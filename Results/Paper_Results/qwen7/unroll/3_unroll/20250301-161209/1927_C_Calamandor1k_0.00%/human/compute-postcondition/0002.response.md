Output State: The output state is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration defined by the value of `t`. For each iteration, the program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It then counts how many elements in `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k` up to the length of the longer list. If both counts are greater than or equal to half of `k` (rounded down), it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the first integer input.
