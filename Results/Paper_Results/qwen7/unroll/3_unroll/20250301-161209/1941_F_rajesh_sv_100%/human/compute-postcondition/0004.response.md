Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with lists \( a \), \( d \), and \( f \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_6()` which performs some unspecified operations. The function does not return any value but processes the input data as described.**
