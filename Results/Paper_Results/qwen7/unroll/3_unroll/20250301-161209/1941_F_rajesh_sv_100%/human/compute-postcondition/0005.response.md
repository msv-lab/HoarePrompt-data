Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` are already initialized to `-inf`, `-inf`, and `None` respectively. These are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n)`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` is the variable that drives the loop, it should start from 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`), otherwise, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
