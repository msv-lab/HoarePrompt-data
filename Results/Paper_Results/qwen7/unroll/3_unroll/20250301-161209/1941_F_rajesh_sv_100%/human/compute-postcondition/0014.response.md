Functionality: **The function accepts three lists: A (problem complexities), D (sorted model complexities), and F (function complexities). It finds the largest difference (`max_diff`) and the second largest difference (`next_max_diff`) between consecutive elements in A. Then, for each complexity in F, it uses binary search to find the closest model complexity in D that can balance the differences. Finally, it prints the maximum value between `max_diff` and `next_max_diff`, or the minimum imbalance found during the search process.**
