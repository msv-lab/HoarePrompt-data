Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for updating `la` and `lb` and counting the penalty is flawed. 

Consider the following input:
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program's output for this case is `3`, but the correct output should be `3` as well, which the program correctly calculates. However, consider another input:
```
5
2 1 3 4 5
```

The program's output for this case is `1`, but the correct output should be `2`. Hereâ€™s why:

- One optimal split could be `s = [2, 3, 4, 5]` and `t = [1]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 3` and `p(t) = 0`, totaling `3`.
- Another optimal split could be `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`, resulting in penalties `p(s) = 2` and `p(t) = 1`, totaling `3`.

The program incorrectly counts the penalty by only considering the first occurrence of an element that is greater than both `la` and `lb`. This leads to an undercounting of the penalty in certain scenarios, as demonstrated by the second example. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
