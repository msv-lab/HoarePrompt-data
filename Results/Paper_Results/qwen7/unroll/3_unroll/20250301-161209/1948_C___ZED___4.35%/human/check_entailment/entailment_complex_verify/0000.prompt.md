You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively; after processing all test cases, the output contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings of length `n`, where each character is either '<' or '>'. It then checks specific conditions related to the characters in these strings. If certain conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each case based on the specified conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to check if the robot can reach the last column (2, n) when the arrows in the first row do not allow the robot to move down to the second row in the required manner.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 4). The path would be:
1. From (1, 1) to (1, 2) (right arrow in the first row).
2. From (1, 2) to (1, 3) (right arrow in the first row).
3. From (1, 3) to (1, 4) (right arrow in the first row).

Since there is no way for the robot to move down to the second row, the robot cannot reach (2, 4). However, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' because it only checks the last character of the second row and the value of `n`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the robot can reach the last column by checking if there is a valid path from the first row to the second row at each step. This can be done by ensuring that there is at least one sequence of arrows that allows the robot to move down to the second row and then proceed to the last column.
