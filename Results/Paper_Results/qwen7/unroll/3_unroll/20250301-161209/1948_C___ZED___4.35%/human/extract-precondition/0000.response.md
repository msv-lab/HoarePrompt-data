Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.**
