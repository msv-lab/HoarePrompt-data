You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers, start_index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, and res is a list that will store the results of the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, and `res` is an empty list.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, and `res` is an empty list.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is an empty list, and `i` is not equal to 0.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list where each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) is set to `i`, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is equal to 0.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - 1, `res` is a list containing one tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i]` equals `i`, then `i` is set to 0 and no changes are made to `arr` or `res`. Otherwise, each element from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) in `arr` is set to `i`, and `res` is updated to contain one tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter i, and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
