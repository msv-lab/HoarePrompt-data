You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] <= m:
            ans = ans + m - d[val]
    print(ans)

def func_1():
    return 0



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts no parameters and always returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems that need to be created. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that each round requires a unique set of difficulty levels, and it incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of problems needed can be calculated by comparing the frequency of each difficulty level to the number of rounds.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `5`. Here's why:

- The bank has the following difficulties: B, G, E, C, D, B, D, C, B, E.
- For 2 rounds, we need at least one problem of each of the 7 difficulty levels ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').
- The bank only has 2 'B's, 2 'C's, 2 'D's, and 2 'E's, which means we need to create additional problems for the remaining difficulty levels ('A', 'F', 'G').

Thus, the correct answer is 5 (one for each of 'A', 'F', and 'G', plus the extra 'B', 'C', and 'D' needed).

The program fails to handle this scenario correctly, making it incorrect.
