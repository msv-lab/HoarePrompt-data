#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5; a is a string of n characters where each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0
