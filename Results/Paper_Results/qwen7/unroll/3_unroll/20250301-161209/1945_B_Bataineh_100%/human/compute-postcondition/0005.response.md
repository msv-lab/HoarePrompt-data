Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases (up to 10^4 cases), where for each case, it takes three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) as inputs. Based on the relationships between these integers, it prints one of four possible outputs: 2, \(2 + \frac{m}{b}\), \(2 + \frac{m}{a}\), or \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\). After processing all test cases, it concludes without returning any value.**
