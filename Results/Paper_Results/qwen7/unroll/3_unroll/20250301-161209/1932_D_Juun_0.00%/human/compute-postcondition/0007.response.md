Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings), `answers` is a list of strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None. The `trumps` list contains all ranks of cards that match the trump suit. For each suit that appears more than once in the input, `answers` contains a string with the sorted ranks of that suit concatenated with the suit itself. If a suit does not appear more than once, its value in the `suits` dictionary remains None.
