State right before the while loop, the `trumps` list is a sorted list of the ranks (strings) from the original `trumps` list.
```
while trumps != []:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `trumps != []`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, `trumps` must not be an empty list.

Given that `trumps` is a sorted list of the ranks (strings) from the original `trumps` list, it means `trumps` was originally non-empty. However, since we don't know the exact state of `trumps` just before the loop, we need to ensure that `trumps` is not empty for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `trumps` is not an empty list.

State: **`trumps` is a non-empty sorted list of the ranks (strings) from the original `trumps` list**
