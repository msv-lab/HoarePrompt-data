Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of type i after processing all iterations of the loop. The value of ans is calculated based on the final state of the list a and the value of k, where ans is either the factorial of n if k is sufficient to equalize all card types, or a product of differences between consecutive elements in the modified list a.
