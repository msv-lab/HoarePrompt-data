Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and a list a containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). For each test case, the function returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function takes a set of inputs including multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t`, two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information related to the given constraints and relationships between the inputs.
