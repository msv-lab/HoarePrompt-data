Output State: **`cnt` is a defaultdict where the keys are the unique integers from the list `a` and the values are their respective counts after iterating through the list `a` for `N` times; `t` is 0.**

The variable `t` is assigned the value 0, which initializes `t` to zero. The state of `cnt` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it within the given code snippet.
