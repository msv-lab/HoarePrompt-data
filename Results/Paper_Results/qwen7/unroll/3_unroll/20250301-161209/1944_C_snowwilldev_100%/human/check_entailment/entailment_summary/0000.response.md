Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The problem specifies that Alice can pick any element from the array `a`, append it to her array `c`, and then delete it from `a`. However, the provided code does not simulate Alice appending elements to `c`. Instead, it only counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.

2. **Incorrect Objective**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i]` is 0 or `t` (which increments when `cnt[i]` is 1) reaches 2. This does not align with the goal of determining the MEX of `c` after the game ends. The MEX of `c` should be calculated based on the elements Alice and Bob have picked, not just the count of elements.

3. **No Simulation of Turns**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. It simply counts the occurrences of elements and determines the MEX based on these counts without considering whose turn it is or how the game progresses.

Given these discrepancies, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
