You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. If the count of `0` is not zero, it finds the smallest index `j` (starting from 1) where the count of `j` is less than 2 or reaches the end of the array. If the count of `0` is zero, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a count array `cntl` to keep track of how many times each element appears in `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using the `cntl` array.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it means there is no zero in the array, so the MEX is 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the MEX as follows:
     - `c` is initially set to the minimum of 2 and the count of zeros (`cntl[0]`).
     - It then iterates through the elements from 1 to `n`:
       - If the count of any element `j` is less than 2, it decrements `c`.
       - If `c` becomes zero or the loop reaches the end of the array, it prints the current value of `j` as the MEX.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Zero Handling:**
   - The logic correctly handles the case where there are no zeros in the array by printing 0 immediately.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. Here’s why:
     - The program assumes that the MEX can only be up to 2, which is incorrect.
     - The program does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
     - The program does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Alice can strategically pick elements to ensure the MEX is maximized, and Bob can strategically pick elements to minimize the MEX.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's re-evaluate the given example test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `4`, `0 0 1 1`
- Expected Output: `2`

The program's output is correct here, but it's due to the specific sequence of moves rather than the optimal strategy.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `4`, `0 1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `1`

Here, the program correctly identifies that the MEX is 1 because there are no zeros and the smallest missing number is 1.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2`, `1 1`
- Expected Output: `0`

Here, the program correctly identifies that the MEX is 0 because there are no zeros and the smallest missing number is 0.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It assumes a fixed upper limit for the MEX and does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
