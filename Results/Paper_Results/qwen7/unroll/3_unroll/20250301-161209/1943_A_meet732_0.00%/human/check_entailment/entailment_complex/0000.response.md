Reasoning:
- The provided code correctly processes the input and calculates the MEX of the array `c` formed during the game.
- The logic for determining the MEX is sound:
  - It first checks if there are any zeros in the array. If there are, the MEX will be 0 because 0 can always be placed in `c`.
  - If there are no zeros, it then determines the smallest index `j` where the count of `j` is less than 2 or reaches the end of the array. This ensures that the smallest missing non-negative integer is found.
- The code handles all edge cases appropriately, such as when the count of `0` is zero and when the count of `j` is less than 2 for some `j`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the code correctly implements the logic to find the optimal MEX for the given game scenario.

Correctness: **True**
