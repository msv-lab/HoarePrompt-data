Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the calculation of the MEX value. Specifically, the program does not account for the different strategies Alice and Bob would use to maximize and minimize the MEX value, respectively. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to pick elements that help her maximize the MEX value. However, the current implementation does not ensure that Alice always picks the optimal element to achieve this.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should aim to pick elements that help him minimize the MEX value. Again, the current implementation does not ensure that Bob always picks the optimal element to achieve this.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct output should be `2`, as shown in the example. However, the provided program will not necessarily produce this result because it does not simulate the optimal moves for both players.

A more accurate approach would involve simulating the optimal moves for both players, ensuring that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. The current implementation does not handle this complexity and thus fails to provide the correct MEX value in all cases.
