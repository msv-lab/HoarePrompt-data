### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Statement Recap

- Alice and Bob play optimally.
- Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
- Bob can pick any element from `a` and delete it without appending it to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The MEX of `c` is calculated at the end.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the arrays for each test case.
   - It initializes a count array `cntl` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a`.

3. **Determining the MEX:**
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed:
     - It assumes that the MEX can only be up to 2, which is incorrect.
     - It does not consider the optimal strategy of both players. Alice can strategically pick elements to ensure the MEX is maximized, and Bob can strategically pick elements to minimize the MEX.
     - The program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

#### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's re-evaluate the given example test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `4`, `0 0 1 1`
- Expected Output: `2`

The program's output is correct here, but it's due to the specific sequence of moves rather than the optimal strategy.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `4`, `0 1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `1`

Here, the program correctly identifies that the MEX is 1 because there are no zeros and the smallest missing number is 1.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2`, `1 1`
- Expected Output: `0`

Here, the program correctly identifies that the MEX is 0 because there are no zeros and the smallest missing number is 0.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It assumes a fixed upper limit for the MEX and does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
