Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. The satisfaction condition is checked using the ceiling function, ensuring that the number of satisfied residents on each side is at least \(\lceil \frac{\text{number of houses on that side}}{2} \rceil\).

2. **Data Structures and Variables**:
   - `n`: Number of houses.
   - `a`: String representing the preferences of the residents (0 for left, 1 for right).
   - `S`: A list storing cumulative counts of 0s and 1s up to each house index.
   - `ans`: Variable to store the optimal position `i`.

3. **Cumulative Count Calculation**:
   - `S` is initialized with `[0, 0]` to handle the prefix sums easily.
   - For each house, update the count of 0s and 1s in `S`.
   - This ensures that `S[i]` contains the total count of 0s and 1s up to house `i-1`.

4. **Optimization Check**:
   - Iterate through each possible position `i` from 0 to `n`.
   - Calculate the number of 0s (`left`) and 1s (`right`) on the left and right sides of the road.
   - Ensure that the number of satisfied residents on each side meets the condition.
   - Update `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the center of the village.

5. **Function Implementation**:
   - `func_1()` performs the logic described above.
   - `func_2()` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles edge cases such as when the road can be placed before the first house (by setting `ans` to 0).
   - It also handles cases where multiple positions have the same minimal distance to the center, choosing the smaller one.

Given the detailed implementation and the correctness of the logic, the provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
