Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly check whether the conditions for the number of satisfied residents on both sides of the road are met. 

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Logic for Checking Conditions**: The program calculates the number of zeros (`left`) and ones (`right`) on both sides of the road but does not correctly apply the condition that at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents should be satisfied on each side. Instead, it checks if \(2 \times \text{left} \geq \text{lsum}\) and \(2 \times \text{right} \geq \text{rsum}\), which is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be that the number of zeros on the left side and the number of ones on the right side should each be at least \(\lceil \frac{\text{lsum}}{2} \rceil\) and \(\lceil \frac{\text{rsum}}{2} \rceil\), respectively.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the input `n = 3` and `a = "101"`. According to the problem description, the road should be placed after the second house (index 2). However, the current implementation incorrectly identifies the road placement after the first house (index 1).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        (x, y) = S[-1]
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        S.append([x, y])
    
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        lsum = i
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        rsum = n - i
        
        if (left >= ceil(lsum / 2)) and (right >= ceil(rsum / 2)):
            if abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans) or (abs(n / 2 - i) == abs(n / 2 - ans) and i < ans):
                ans = i
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected function ensures that the conditions for the number of satisfied residents on both sides are correctly checked, and it finds the optimal position for the road.
