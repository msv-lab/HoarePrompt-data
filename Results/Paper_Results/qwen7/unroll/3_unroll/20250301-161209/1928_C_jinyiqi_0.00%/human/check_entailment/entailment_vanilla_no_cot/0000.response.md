Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sep`**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`. However, the logic to filter valid `k` values is flawed. Specifically, the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be adjusted to ensure it correctly identifies valid `k`.

2. **Redundant Filtering**:
   - The filtering condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is incorrect because it should check if `s + 2` is a valid `k` value. Instead, it should directly check if `s + 2` is even and within the range of possible `k` values.

3. **Unnecessary Use of `set`**:
   - Using `list(set(output))` to remove duplicates is unnecessary since the divisors returned by `func_1` are already unique.

4. **Missing Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `x` is very close to `n`, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []

    # Check for (n + x - 2)
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n + x - 2) // 2
        if k >= x:
            output.append(k)

    # Check for (n - x)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n - x) // 2
        if k >= x:
            output.append(k)

    print(len(output))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Divisor Calculation**:
   - We directly calculate potential `k` values using `(n + x - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`.
   - These values are checked to ensure they are greater than or equal to `x`.

2. **Output**:
   - The length of the resulting list `output` is printed, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies all valid `k` values for each test case.
