You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, listed in reverse order, followed by their corresponding quotients.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - It splits the input into `n` and `x` for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions for Valid `k`:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` is even and if `(n - x)` is even.
   - If either condition is met, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate value and processes the results.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It calculates both proper divisors and their corresponding pairs.
   - The function returns the divisors in a specific order (though the order is not critical for the logic).

4. **Processing Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` from `func_1`, the program checks if `(s + 2)` is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are met, the divisor `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the `output` list.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set and then back to a list to remove duplicates.

### Correctness Check

1. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of the given number.
   - However, the logic for determining valid `k` values seems flawed because:
     - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be checked against `n` instead of `x`.
     - The divisor `s` should be checked if it fits within the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Condition for Valid `k`:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be replaced with `(s + 2) / 2 <= n` to ensure `k` is within the valid range.
   - Additionally, the condition `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` need to be consistent with the problem statement.

### Revised Logic

Here is a revised version of the logic to ensure correctness:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    
    # Check for (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) // 2 <= n:
                output.append((s + 2) // 2)
    
    # Check for (n - x) % 2 == 0
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) // 2 <= n:
                output.append((s + 2) // 2)
    
    output = list(set(output))
```

### Conclusion

Given the revised logic, the original program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine valid `k` values. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
