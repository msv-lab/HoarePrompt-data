Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining how many values of \( k \) satisfy the given conditions for a given position \( n \) and number \( x \) received by Vasya during the settling process.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( x \) received by Vasya must fit within the repeating pattern of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` computes all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - It returns divisors in reverse order followed by their corresponding quotients.

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     2. \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - These conditions ensure that \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, which is necessary for the divisors to be correctly interpreted in the context of the settling pattern.

5. **Divisor Calculation and Filtering**:
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to get all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It filters these divisors to find those that are greater than or equal to \( x \) when divided by 2.

6. **Set Conversion**:
   - The program converts the filtered results to a set to remove duplicates.

Given the analysis, the logic in the annotated program seems to correctly implement the steps required to solve the problem. The main steps include:
- Checking the parity conditions.
- Using `func_1` to find relevant divisors.
- Filtering and converting the results to a set.

Therefore, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
