### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\).
   - If no such pair exists, the program should output \((-1, -1)\).

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries defined by pairs of indices `l` and `r`.
   - It determines a subarray within `nums` and outputs either the start and end indices of a segment within this subarray or \((-1, -1)\) if no valid segment is found.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case where there are no two different elements within the queried range.
   - The program assumes that there will always be a pair of different elements within the queried range, but this is not necessarily true. For example, if all elements in the queried range are the same, the program should output \((-1, -1)\).

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program constructs a list `arr` where each element is a tuple containing the start index, end index, and the value of the segment.
   - It then uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment within the queried range.
   - The program checks if the start index `s` of the segment is greater than `l` and if the end index `e` of the segment is less than `r`.
   - If these conditions are met, it prints the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, it prints \((-1, -1)\).

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the queried range consists of identical elements by printing \((-1, -1)\) when no valid segment is found.
   - The program also handles the case where the start index `s` is exactly `l` and the end index `e` is exactly `r`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles the edge case where there are no two different elements within the queried range. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does handle this case properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
