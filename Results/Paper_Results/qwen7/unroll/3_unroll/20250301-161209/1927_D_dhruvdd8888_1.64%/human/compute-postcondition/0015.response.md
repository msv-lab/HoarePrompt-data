Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop head is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer (since the range function requires a non-negative integer).
   - Therefore, the input must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust any other variables related to the loop body itself.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

### Final Answer:

State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer**
