### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the input and processes the array `nums` to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - It then uses these segments to efficiently answer the queries.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts within the range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the position of this segment, it determines whether there are distinct elements within the queried range.
   - The logic handles various cases:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the first and second element of the segment.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `r`, it prints `-1 -1` because no distinct elements exist in the range.
     - If the end of the segment is within bounds but not in the last segment, it prints the indices of the start and end of the segment.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles edge cases like when the start of the segment is exactly `l` and when the end of the segment is exactly `r`.

4. **Output Consistency**:
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The annotated program includes a check for `ppp == 23` to print intermediate values, which helps in debugging.
   - The logic seems to handle the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement correctly.
