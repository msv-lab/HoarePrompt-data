Functionality: **The function processes a series of inputs, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each input, it checks specific conditions involving these integers and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether those conditions are satisfied. After processing all inputs, it outputs a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' values corresponding to each input's evaluation.**
