Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. The logic within the loop checks different conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal:
   - If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 1`. This condition ensures that Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario of losing up to `x` times in a row and still have enough coins to start a new sequence of bets.
   - If `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 3`. This condition is specific to the case where the maximum number of consecutive losses equals `k - 1`, ensuring Sasha can recover after a series of losses.
   - For all other cases (`x > k - 1`), the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can continue betting without running out of coins before the promotion limit is reached. The formula used is derived from the recurrence relation considering the growth of Sasha's coins after winning and the reduction after losing.
4. The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can achieve his goal and 'NO' otherwise.
5. Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all edge cases and correctly determines whether Sasha can achieve his goal.

Correctness: **True**
