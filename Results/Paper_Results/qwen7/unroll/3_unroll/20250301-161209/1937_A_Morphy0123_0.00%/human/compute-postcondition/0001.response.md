Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n_cases)` will execute if `n_cases` is at least 1. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `n_cases` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will start from 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
