Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)). For each \( n \), it determines and prints either \( 1 \) or \( 2^{\text{power}} \), where \( \text{power} \) is the smallest integer such that \( 2^{\text{power}} \geq n \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
