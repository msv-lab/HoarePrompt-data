You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The list a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) where each element dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from index i with j cards in hand, given the conditions specified in the loop. The exact values depend on the input `cards`, but the structure remains as described.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from index 0 with 0 cards in hand, as represented by the dp[0][0] element in the 2D list dp.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with global variables or predefined lists and integers. It calculates and returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from index 0 with 0 cards in hand, as represented by the dp[0][0] element in the 2D list dp.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from index 0 with 0 cards in hand, as represented by the dp[0][0] element in the 2D list dp.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
