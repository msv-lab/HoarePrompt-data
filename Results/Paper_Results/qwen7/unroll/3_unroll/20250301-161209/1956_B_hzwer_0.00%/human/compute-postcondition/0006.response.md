Output State: `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) where each element dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from index i with j cards in hand. The exact values depend on the input `cards`, but generally, dp[0][0] will contain the solution to the problem of maximizing the number of cards collected.
