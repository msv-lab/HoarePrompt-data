Output State: `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) where each element dp[i][j] represents the maximum number of cards that can be collected starting from index i with j cards in hand, given the conditions specified in the loop. The exact values depend on the input `cards`, but the structure remains as described.
