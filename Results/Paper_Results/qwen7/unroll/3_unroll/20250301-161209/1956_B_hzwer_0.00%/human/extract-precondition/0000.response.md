Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The list a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
