Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the list `A` starting from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found under the same conditions, and `index` is the index `i` where `max_diff` was last updated; `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`; `ans` is equal to `max_diff`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = max_diff` assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
