Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: The state before the loop starts is given as `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf`, and `index` is `None`. These variables are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should start from 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
