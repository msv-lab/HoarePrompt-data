Output State: `max_diff` is the minimum difference found between `left + f` and `D[l] + f` or `right - D[l] - f` for all `f` in `F`, `next_max_diff` remains the second maximum difference found under the same conditions, `index` remains the index `i` where `max_diff` was last updated; `left` and `right` remain `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` respectively; `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.
