Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum imbalance after potentially adding one new problem with a custom complexity derived from combining a model and a function.
2. **Key Components**:
   - **Initial Setup**: The program correctly initializes the necessary data structures and functions.
   - **Reading Input**: Functions `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` handle reading input and converting it to the required data types.
   - **Core Logic**: Function `func_6` implements the core logic to find the minimum imbalance.
   - **Output**: Function `func_7` processes multiple test cases and calls `func_6` for each.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**, **func_2**, **func_3**, **func_4**, **func_5**, and **func_6** are helper functions that support the main logic.
   - **func_6** correctly identifies the current maximum and second maximum differences (`max_diff` and `next_max_diff`) and then iterates through all possible combinations of model and function to find the minimum imbalance.
   - **Fenwick Tree and SortedList**: These data structures are used efficiently to manage and query the complexities of the problems.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled appropriately with the use of efficient data structures like Fenwick Tree and SortedList.
   - The logic correctly considers all possible additions of a new problem and updates the imbalance accordingly.

5. **Overall Flow**:
   - The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the problem requirements accurately and handles all necessary operations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
