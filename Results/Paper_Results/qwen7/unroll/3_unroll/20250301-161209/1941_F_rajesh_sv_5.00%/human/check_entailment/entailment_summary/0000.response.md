Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the minimum imbalance after potentially adding one new problem complexity by combining a model and a function.
- The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem:
  - `func_2` reads a line from standard input.
  - `func_3` converts the input line to an integer.
  - `func_4` reads a line from standard input, splits it by spaces, and converts the resulting strings to integers.
  - `func_5` calls `func_2` and returns the result.
  - `func_6` calculates the initial imbalance and attempts to reduce it by adding a new problem complexity using available models and functions.
  - `func_7` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.

- The core logic in `func_6`:
  - It first calculates the initial imbalance (`max_diff`) between consecutive problem complexities.
  - It then iterates over each function complexity and tries to find a combination of a model and a function that minimizes the imbalance.
  - The final result is the minimum of the initial imbalance and the best possible imbalance found by adding a new problem complexity.

Given the provided functions and their execution summaries, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. There are no apparent errors or missing parts that would cause the program to fail in meeting the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
