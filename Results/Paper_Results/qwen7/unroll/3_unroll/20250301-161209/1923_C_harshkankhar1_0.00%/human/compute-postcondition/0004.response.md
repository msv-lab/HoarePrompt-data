Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is equal to `1 * i` if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise `2 * i`.

This means that for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, the value of `b[i]` will be either `i` (if `a[i] > 1`) or `2i` (if `a[i] <= 1`). The first element of `b` remains 0 as it was initialized.
