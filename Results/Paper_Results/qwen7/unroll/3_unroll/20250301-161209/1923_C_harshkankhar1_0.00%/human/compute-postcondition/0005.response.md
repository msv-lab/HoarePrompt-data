Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is equal to `x * i`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` or 2 if `a[i] <= 1`.

In this output state, the variable `b` is updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the previous element `b[i-1]` and `x`, where `x` is 1 if the corresponding element `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
