Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by processing the input array `arr` and computing a list `mex` based on the positive elements in `arr`. However, the logic used to compute the `mex` values is flawed and does not correctly implement the MEX calculation as described in the problem statement.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program only considers the positive elements in `arr` to calculate the MEX values. This is incorrect because the MEX of a set should consider all elements up to the current index, not just the positive ones.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**: The program handles negative values incorrectly by subtracting the minimum non-negative integer (`minn`) from their absolute values. This does not reflect the MEX calculation as defined in the problem.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The program increments `minn` and checks if it equals `maxx`, which is not relevant to the MEX calculation. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subset of the array up to the current index.

Given these issues, the program does not produce the correct permutation `p` that satisfies the condition `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

Correctness: **False**
