Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `minn` is the maximum value between the last updated `minn` and `maxx` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing the values of `minn` for each positive element in `arr`, and `maxx` is the maximum value between the original `maxx` and the differences between elements in `arr` and `minn`.
Code of the loop:
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
