Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over `itm` in `mex`. Therefore, the objects in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `itm` will take on the values from the list `mex` one by one during each iteration of the loop.
   - `mex` is a list containing the values of `minn` for each positive element in `arr`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `mex` must contain at least one element. If `mex` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `itm` will take on the values from `mex`, the initial state of `itm` is not as critical as ensuring `mex` is non-empty.
   - We need to ensure that `mex` contains at least one element.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `mex` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`mex` must contain at least one element**
