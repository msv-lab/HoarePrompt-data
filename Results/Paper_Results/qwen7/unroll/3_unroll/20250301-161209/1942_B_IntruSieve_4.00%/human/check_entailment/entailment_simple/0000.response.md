Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: Inside `func_1()`, the variables `n`, `arr`, `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` are initialized properly. This is also correct.

3. **Mex Calculation**: The logic for calculating `mex` values seems to have some issues:
   - The intention is to calculate the MEX for each prefix of the permutation `p`. However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate the construction of `p` from `a`.
   - The `mex` list is supposed to store the MEX values for each position in the permutation. Instead, the code is trying to update `minn` and `maxx` based on the values in `arr`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the `mex` values, which do not correspond to the expected output of the permutation `p`.

Given the problem statement, the goal is to construct a permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`. The current implementation does not achieve this goal. It seems to be attempting to calculate MEX values but does not correctly simulate the construction of the permutation.

Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
