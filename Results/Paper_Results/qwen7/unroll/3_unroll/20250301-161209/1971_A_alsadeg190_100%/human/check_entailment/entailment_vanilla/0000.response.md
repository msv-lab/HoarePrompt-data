### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires processing multiple test cases. For each test case, it needs to find the minimum and maximum of two integers \(x\) and \(y\), and then print them in the specified order.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line of input.
   
3. **Loop for Test Cases**: The `for i in range(x)` loop iterates over each test case, where `x` is the number of test cases read initially.

4. **Reading Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers \(x\) and \(y\) using `input().split()`, which is correctly converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This part is correct.

5. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: 
   - The program checks if \(x < y\) and prints \(x\) followed by \(y\) if true.
   - If not, it prints \(y\) followed by \(x\).
   - This logic ensures that the smaller number is always printed first, followed by the larger number.

6. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem statement, with each pair of integers separated by a space.

Given the above points, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
