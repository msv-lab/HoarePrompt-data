### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Special Character Calculation**:
   - For `n == 1`, the program correctly outputs "NO" since it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of length 1.
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string with pairs of distinct characters, ensuring each character has exactly one special neighbor. This is correct because each character except the first and last will have exactly one special neighbor.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' to ensure the first three characters meet the special condition, and then continues to add pairs of distinct characters. This ensures that all characters except possibly the last one will have exactly one special neighbor. However, the last character might not have a special neighbor, but this is acceptable since the problem only requires exactly `n` special characters, not all characters to be special.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if a valid string exists, and "NO" otherwise. This matches the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case when `n == 1` correctly by outputting "NO".
   - It also handles both even and odd values of `n` appropriately, ensuring the construction logic is sound.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:

**True**
