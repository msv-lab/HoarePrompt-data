Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the case when \( n = 1 \) by printing "NO".
2. For even \( n \), the function constructs a string where each character appears twice, ensuring that every character except the first and last is special. This is because each character (except the first and last) has exactly one different neighbor.
3. For odd \( n \), the function starts with 'AAA' and then constructs the rest of the string similarly to the even case, ensuring that the first three characters are special and the remaining characters follow the same pattern as the even case.
4. The function ensures that the constructed string has a length of at most 200, which is within the constraints given.
5. The function processes each test case correctly and prints the appropriate output for each case.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
