The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( t \) and \( n \). It prints 'YES' followed by a string \( ans \) based on the value of \( n \). If \( n \) is 1, it prints 'NO'. For even \( n \), \( ans \) consists of pairs of characters from the string \( s \) repeated \( n/2 \) times. For odd \( n \), \( ans \) starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of characters from \( s \) repeated \( (n-3)/2 \) times. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
