Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two integers: t and n, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each test case, if t is within the specified range and n is within the specified range, the function does not return anything specific but processes these values.**

Given the constraints and the provided format, it's important to note that the function itself does not accept any parameters in the traditional sense (i.e., through its definition). Instead, it seems to imply processing a series of test cases with specific ranges for t and n. The function's behavior is not detailed in the provided output, so it's described based on the input constraints.
