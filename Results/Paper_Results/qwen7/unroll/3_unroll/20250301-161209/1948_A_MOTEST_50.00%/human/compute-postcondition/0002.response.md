Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `s` is a string containing the uppercase English alphabet**.

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 50, and `s` remains a string containing the uppercase English alphabet.
