Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the input values provided in each line of the input file (standard input), where `s` is read from. Each line contains values for `k`, `x`, and `a` which are used to determine the output for that specific iteration.
