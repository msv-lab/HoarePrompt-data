### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`. This approach is appropriate for handling multiple test cases where each test case is on a new line.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are correctly extracted from the input string using `map(int, s.split())`.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**: 
     - If Sasha can lose at most \( x \) times in a row and \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from any number of losses by betting appropriately. The condition `if a >= x + 1:` ensures that Sasha can afford at least one more bet after a series of losses. This logic is correct.
   
   - **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \)**:
     - If Sasha can lose exactly \( k - 1 \) times in a row, Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from \( k - 1 \) consecutive losses. The condition `if a >= x + 2:` checks if Sasha can afford two consecutive wins after a series of losses. This logic is also correct.
   
   - **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**:
     - If Sasha can lose more than \( k - 1 \) times in a row, Sasha needs to check if he can recover from a series of losses. The nested loop calculates the minimum number of coins required to recover from \( x \) consecutive losses. The logic here is to iteratively calculate the required coins using the formula \( z = z // (k - 1) + 1 \). This logic is correct as well.

4. **Output Generation**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked, which matches the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases accurately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
