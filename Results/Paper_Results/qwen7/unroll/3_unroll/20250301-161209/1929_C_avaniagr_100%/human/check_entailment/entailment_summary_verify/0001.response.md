### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Input Reading and Parsing
- The program reads from standard input and parses the input values `k`, `x`, and `a` from each test case.
- This part is correct and matches the problem description.

#### Condition Checking
- The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`:
  - If `x < k - 1`:
    - It checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
  - If `x == k - 1`:
    - It checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
  - If `x > k - 1`:
    - It calculates `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

#### Calculation of `z`
- The calculation of `z` in the loop seems to be an attempt to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times to accumulate any desired number of coins.
- The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used within the loop, which iterates `x - k + 3` times.

### Detailed Explanation of `z` Calculation

- **Initial Value of `z`:**
  - Initially, `z` is set to `k - 2`.

- **Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop runs `x - k + 3` times.
  - In each iteration, `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Case `x < k - 1`:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least one win.
   - This condition is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Case `x == k - 1`:**
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still win enough times to get any number of coins because he can place a bet of 1 coin after a loss.
   - The condition `a >= x + 2` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start with at least two wins.
   - This condition is correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Case `x > k - 1`:**
   - The loop calculates `z` to determine the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple wins and losses.
   - The condition `a >= z` checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to reach the calculated value `z`.
   - However, the loop calculation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is incorrect. This formula does not accurately represent the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple wins and losses. Instead, it should be more complex to account for the exponential growth due to the promotion rule.

### Example Counter-Example

Consider the test case:
- `k = 3`, `x = 2`, `a = 1`

- **Expected Behavior:**
  - Sasha can win twice in a row, so he can get 2 * 2 = 4 coins.
  - Therefore, the expected output is 'YES'.

- **Program Behavior:**
  - `x == k - 1` is true.
  - The condition `a >= x + 2` is checked.
  - `a = 1` and `x + 2 = 3`, so the condition fails.
  - The program prints 'NO'.

This counter-example shows that the program is incorrect for the case `x == k - 1`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was inaccurate because the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can win enough times. The loop calculation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately represent the growth of Sasha's coins over multiple wins and losses.
