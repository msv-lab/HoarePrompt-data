Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where `x` (maximum number of consecutive losses) is greater than `k-1` (the multiplier for winning bets minus one). 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `4 88 1000000000`
- Expected Output: `YES`

However, the program logic does not cover the case where `x` is significantly larger than `k-1`. For large values of `x`, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it does not properly calculate the required number of coins `z` to ensure Sasha can eventually win any number of coins. The program's logic for calculating `z` is flawed and does not correctly account for the growth of Sasha's coin count over multiple rounds of betting.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can eventually win any number of coins, considering the constraints on consecutive losses and the multiplier for winning bets.
