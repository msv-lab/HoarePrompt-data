Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the input values provided in each line of the input file, which are read by the loop. Since the input values are not specified, the output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific inputs. However, it will be a series of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to each line of input processed by the loop.
