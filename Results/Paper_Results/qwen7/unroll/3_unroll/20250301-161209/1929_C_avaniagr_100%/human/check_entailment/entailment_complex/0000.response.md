Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input values \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\) from each line of the input.
2. It handles the different conditions specified in the problem statement:
   - If \(x < k - 1\), it checks if \(a \geq x + 1\).
   - If \(x = k - 1\), it checks if \(a \geq x + 2\).
   - If \(x > k - 1\), it calculates a value \(z\) using the formula and checks if \(a \geq z\).
3. The logic for calculating \(z\) seems to be based on the idea that Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue betting to increase his coins. This part of the logic appears to be correct based on the problem constraints and the provided examples.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements and conditions specified in the problem. The program correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee having at least \(n\) coins for any integer \(n\).

Correctness: **True**
