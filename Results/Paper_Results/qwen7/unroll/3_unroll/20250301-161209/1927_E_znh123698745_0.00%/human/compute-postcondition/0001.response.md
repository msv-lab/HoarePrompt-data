Output State: t test cases are processed, and for each test case, the output is a sequence of numbers printed based on the given rules. Specifically, for each test case with n elements and k (where k is even), the output sequence starts with 1 and alternates between moving left and right in the original array until all elements are visited. The final output is a series of these sequences separated by newlines.
