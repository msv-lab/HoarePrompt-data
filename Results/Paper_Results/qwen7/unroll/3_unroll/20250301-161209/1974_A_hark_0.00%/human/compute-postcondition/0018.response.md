Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the total number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons.**

Given that the function does not accept any parameters but is described in terms of non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) (representing the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively), it implies that the function calculates the total number of icons by summing \(x\) and \(2 \times y\). However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, the description focuses on the absence of parameters and the expected return value based on the provided context.
