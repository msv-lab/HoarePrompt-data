Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and it is assigned the value after all iterations of the loop have executed `func_2()`. The value of `t` remains unchanged because the loop variable `_` is not used inside the loop, and no assignment to `t` is made within the loop body. Therefore, `t` retains its initial value.
