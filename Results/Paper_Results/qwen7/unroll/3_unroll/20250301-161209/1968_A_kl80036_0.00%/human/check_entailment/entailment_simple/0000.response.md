### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized for each test case.

2. **Given Solution**: The provided solution simply prints \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) (integer division) for each test case. 

3. **Analysis**:
   - Let's consider the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - If \( y = \frac{x}{2} \), then \(\gcd(x, \frac{x}{2}) = \frac{x}{2}\) when \( x \) is even, and \(\gcd(x, \frac{x}{2}) = 1\) when \( x \) is odd.
   - For even \( x \):
     - \(\gcd(x, \frac{x}{2}) + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = x\).
   - For odd \( x \):
     - \(\gcd(x, \frac{x}{2}) + \frac{x}{2} = 1 + \frac{x-1}{2}\).

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( x = 10 \):
     - \( y = 5 \): \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
     - However, \( y = 9 \): \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), which is also maximal.
   - Consider \( x = 15 \):
     - \( y = 7 \): \(\gcd(15, 7) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8\).
     - \( y = 9 \): \(\gcd(15, 9) + 9 = 3 + 9 = 12\), which is greater than 8.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not always maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). It only considers \( y = \frac{x}{2} \), which is not necessarily the optimal choice.
