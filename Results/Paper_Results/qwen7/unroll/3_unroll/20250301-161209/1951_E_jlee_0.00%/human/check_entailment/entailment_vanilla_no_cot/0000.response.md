Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The code correctly handles single-character strings by printing "NO" when `n == 1`. However, it should also handle cases where the string consists entirely of the same character, which is a valid scenario for a "NO" output.

2. **Logic for Partitioning**: The logic for determining whether a partition can be made into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. The current implementation checks for specific conditions without considering general cases where the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it incorrectly prints "YES" for some cases where the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings.

4. **General Approach**: The approach taken in the code is overly complex and does not cover all possible scenarios. A simpler and more robust approach would be to check each substring to see if it is a palindrome and then construct the partition accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
        if string == string[::-1]:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Try to find a non-palindromic substring
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(j + 2, n + 1):
                if string[j:k] != string[j:k][::-1]:
                    print("YES")
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:k])
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the entire string is a palindrome and then tries to find a non-palindromic substring. If found, it prints "YES" with the appropriate partition. If no such partition is found, it prints "NO". This approach is simpler and covers all necessary cases.
