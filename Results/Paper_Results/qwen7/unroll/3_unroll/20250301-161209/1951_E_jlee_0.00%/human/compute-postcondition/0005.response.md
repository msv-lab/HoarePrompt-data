Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each string `s`, it checks specific conditions related to the characters in the string. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO', and in some cases, it may also print additional details such as indices or substrings. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
