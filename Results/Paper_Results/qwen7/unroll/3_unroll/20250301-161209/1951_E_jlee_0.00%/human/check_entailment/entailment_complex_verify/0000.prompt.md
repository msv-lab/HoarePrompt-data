You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: Output State: The output state will depend on the input integer `t` and the strings provided as input within each iteration of the loop. For each input string, the program checks specific conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. If the string meets certain criteria, it may also print indices or substrings. After all iterations, the final output consists of all printed statements from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each string `s`, it checks specific conditions related to the characters in the string. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO', and in some cases, it may also print additional details such as indices or substrings. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, consider the input `aaaa`. According to the problem description, the output should be "YES" because we can partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, for example, `a a a a`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this case. Here's why:

1. The program checks if the first character is different from the last character. If they are different, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
2. If the first character is the same as the last character and appears only once, it also prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
3. If the first character is the same as the last character and appears more than once, it further checks if the length of the string is odd and if the middle character is different from the first/last character. If these conditions are met, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
4. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

For the input `aaaa`, the program incorrectly returns "NO" because it does not consider the possibility of partitioning the string into multiple non-palindromic substrings. A correct solution would recognize that `a a a a` is a valid partition.
