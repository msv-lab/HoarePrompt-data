Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `m`) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by this line of code.
