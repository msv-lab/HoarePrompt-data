Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously. The issue lies in the way the variables `A` and `B` are calculated. Specifically, `A` and `B` represent the number of fireworks launched by the first and second installations within the visibility period `m`, respectively. However, the current implementation calculates these values incorrectly.

To illustrate the problem, consider the following test case:
- Input: `6 7 4`

According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and the second installation launches every 7 minutes. Both installations launch fireworks that are visible for 5 minutes. The correct calculation should account for the overlap of these intervals.

However, the current implementation calculates:
- `A = int(m / a) + 1 = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `B = int(m / b) + 1 = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`

This results in `A + B = 2`, which is incorrect because the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously should be 2, as explained in the example note.

A correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches and then calculating the number of simultaneous launches within the visibility period `m`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_visible = min(int(m / a), int(m / b)) + 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected function correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously by considering the periodicity of simultaneous launches.
