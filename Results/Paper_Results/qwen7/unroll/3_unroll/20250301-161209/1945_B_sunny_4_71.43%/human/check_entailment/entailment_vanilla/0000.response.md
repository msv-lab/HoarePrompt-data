Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculating Maximum Visible Fireworks:**
   - The program calculates `A` as the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m`. This is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - Similarly, it calculates `B` as the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m`. This is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sum of `A` and `B`, which represents the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic and the example provided:

#### Example Breakdown

1. **Case 1:**
   - Input: `6 7 4`
   - Calculations:
     - `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1 + 1 = 2`

2. **Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 4 10`
   - Calculations:
     - `A = int(10 / 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`
     - `B = int(10 / 4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Output: `4 + 3 = 7`

3. **Case 3:**
   - Input: `7 8 56`
   - Calculations:
     - `A = int(56 / 7) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9`
     - `B = int(56 / 8) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8`
   - Output: `9 + 8 = 17`

4. **Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 6 78123459896`
   - Calculations:
     - `A = int(78123459896 / 5) + 1 = 15624691979 + 1 = 15624691980`
     - `B = int(78123459896 / 6) + 1 = 13020576649 + 1 = 13020576650`
   - Output: `15624691980 + 13020576650 = 28645268630`

5. **Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Calculations:
     - `A = int(1 / 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - `B = int(1 / 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2 + 2 = 4`

6. **Case 6:**
   - Input: `1 1 1000000000000000000`
   - Calculations:
     - `A = int(1000000000000000000 / 1) + 1 = 1000000000000000000 + 1 = 1000000000000000001`
     - `B = int(1000000000000000000 / 1) + 1 = 1000000000000000000 + 1 = 1000000000000000001`
   - Output: `1000000000000000001 + 1000000000000000001 = 2000000000000000002`

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time based on the given logic. The calculations and outputs match the expected results provided in the examples.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
