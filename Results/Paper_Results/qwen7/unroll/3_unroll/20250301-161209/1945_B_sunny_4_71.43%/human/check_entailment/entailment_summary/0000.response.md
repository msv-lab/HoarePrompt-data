Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of fireworks visible at the same time using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\). However, this approach does not correctly account for the overlap between the intervals of fireworks from both installations. 

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\). The LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) gives us the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. We should calculate the number of intervals within \(m + 1\) minutes for each installation and adjust for the overlap.

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Determining how many times each installation launches fireworks within \(m + 1\) minutes.
3. Adjusting for the overlap to get the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

Given the provided execution summary, the current implementation does not correctly handle the overlap and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
