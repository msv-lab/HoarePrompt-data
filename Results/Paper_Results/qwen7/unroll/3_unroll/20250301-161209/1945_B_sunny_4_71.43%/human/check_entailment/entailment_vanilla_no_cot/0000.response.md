Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period \(m\), but it fails to account for the simultaneous launches that can overlap and be visible at the same time.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches, and then calculate how many such simultaneous launches fit into the visibility period \(m\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of simultaneous launches
        num_simultaneous_launches = (m // lcm_ab) + 1
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        # The maximum number of fireworks seen at the same time
        max_visible = A + B - num_simultaneous_launches
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program should provide the right answer by accounting for the simultaneous launches.
