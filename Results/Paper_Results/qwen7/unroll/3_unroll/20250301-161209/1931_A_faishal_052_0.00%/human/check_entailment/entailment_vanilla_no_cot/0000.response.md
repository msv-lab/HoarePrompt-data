Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Characters:**
   - The program tries to determine the characters by checking ranges (`lex <= 26` and `lex < 52`). However, it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the characters based on the remaining value after each subtraction.
   - For example, for the input `24`, the program incorrectly outputs `aav` instead of the correct answer `aaa`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value:**
   - The program attempts to append values directly without considering the correct character positions. It should determine the characters based on the remaining value after each subtraction from 26.

3. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array before converting to characters is unnecessary and incorrect. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest word, which means we need to determine the characters directly from the remaining value.

### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should:
1. Determine the first character by taking the minimum possible value that fits within the remaining sum.
2. Subtract the value of the first character from the sum.
3. Repeat the process for the second and third characters.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        result = []
        for j in range(3):
            # Find the maximum possible character that can fit into the remaining sum
            for k in range(26, 0, -1):
                if lex >= k:
                    result.append(k)
                    lex -= k
                    break
        # Convert numbers to characters
        for k in result:
            print(chr(k + 96), end='')
        print()

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.
