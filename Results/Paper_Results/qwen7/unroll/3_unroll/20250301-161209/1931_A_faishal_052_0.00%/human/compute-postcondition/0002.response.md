Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lowercase letters based on the input value of `lex`. For each iteration of the outer loop, the program processes the value of `lex`, which is reduced according to specific rules, and then prints three sorted characters corresponding to the modified `lex` value. The exact characters printed depend on the initial value of `lex`, but they will always be lowercase letters due to the addition of 96 to the array elements before printing (since 'a' in ASCII is 97). The number of such sets of three characters printed will be equal to the value of `cases`.
