Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the inner loops is flawed and does not accurately determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Specifically, the program incorrectly processes the value of `lex` and does not handle the full range of possible values for `n` (from 3 to 78).

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of `lex`**: The program attempts to reduce `lex` by either 1 or 26 in the inner loops, which is not a comprehensive approach to handling all possible values of `lex`.
2. **Sorting and Replacing Values**: The program sorts the array `arr` and then replaces the last element with the remaining value of `lex`, which does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.
3. **Character Conversion**: The program converts the values to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, but the process of determining the values in `arr` is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest combination of three letters that sum up to `n`. This involves finding the largest possible value for the first character, then the second, and finally the third, ensuring the sum matches `n`.

Correctness: **False**
