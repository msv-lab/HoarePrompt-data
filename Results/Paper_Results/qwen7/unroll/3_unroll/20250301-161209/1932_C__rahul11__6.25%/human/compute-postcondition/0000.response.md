Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; the string `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `MOD` is 10 ** 9 + 6.**

The code initializes the constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 6`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
