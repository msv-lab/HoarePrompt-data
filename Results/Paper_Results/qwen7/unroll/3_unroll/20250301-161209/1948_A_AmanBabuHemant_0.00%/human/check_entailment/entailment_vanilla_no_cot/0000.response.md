Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Odd `n`**: The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, no solution exists and prints "NO". However, it should still check if `n` is even before attempting to construct the string, as the logic to generate the string is only valid for even `n`.

2. **String Construction Logic**: The string construction logic using `'110' * (n // 2)` is flawed because:
   - It generates a string with a fixed pattern (`110`), which does not necessarily meet the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
   - The pattern `'110'` does not guarantee that each character will have exactly one neighbor that matches it, especially when constructing longer strings.

3. **Special Character Requirement**: The program needs to ensure that each character in the generated string has exactly one matching neighbor, which is not guaranteed by the current approach.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Check if `n` is even.
- Construct a string where each character has exactly one matching neighbor, ensuring the count of special characters is `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Generate a string with exactly n special characters
            s = 'A' + 'B' * (n - 1)
            print('YES')
            print(s)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the string generated has exactly `n` special characters by alternating between 'A' and 'B'.
