You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) and another positive integer \( n \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string \( s \) consisting of '110' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of \( s \) is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by \( s \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the number of special characters required in the string.
   - It checks if `n` is odd:
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character has exactly one neighbor different from it.
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string with `n` special characters.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)`. This pattern ensures that every third character is different from its neighbors, making them special.
   - It then checks if the constructed string `s` is less than 200 characters long. If it is, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Pattern Construction:**
   - The pattern `'110'` is used to create special characters. However, this pattern does not ensure that every character is special. For example, in the string `AAABAACC`, all characters are special, but the pattern `'110'` does not guarantee this.
   - The pattern `'110'` creates a repeating sequence of three characters, which does not necessarily meet the requirement of having exactly one neighbor different for each special character.

2. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n` is odd by printing "NO". This is correct because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the given constraints.

3. **String Length Check:**
   - The program checks if the constructed string is less than 200 characters. However, this check is unnecessary since the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, it will fit within 200 characters.

4. **Special Character Definition:**
   - The program does not correctly define or count special characters. The pattern `'110'` does not ensure that each character is special according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not properly construct a string with the required number of special characters. The pattern `'110'` does not guarantee that each character is special, and the program does not handle the construction of the string correctly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
