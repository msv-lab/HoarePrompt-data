Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it correctly checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' immediately, which is correct because an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given construction method.
- If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that each character in the string, except the first and last, has exactly one neighbor that is different, making them special characters.
- The constructed string `s` is checked to ensure its length is less than 200. If it is, 'YES' is printed followed by `s`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
- The logic for constructing the string and checking its length is sound and meets the problem requirements.
- The program handles all edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 2 (resulting in 'MM') or when `n` is 6 (resulting in 'AAABAACC').

Correctness: **True**
