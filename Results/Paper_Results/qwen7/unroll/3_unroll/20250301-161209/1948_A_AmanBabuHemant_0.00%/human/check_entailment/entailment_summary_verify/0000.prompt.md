You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) and another positive integer \( n \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string \( s \) consisting of '110' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of \( s \) is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by \( s \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters. According to the problem description, a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. However, the current implementation generates strings that do not necessarily meet this criterion. For example, consider the case when `n = 1`. The program will output "NO", which is correct according to the problem statement. However, for other values of `n`, the generated string may not have exactly `n` special characters. For instance, if `n = 2`, the program outputs "MM" which has 2 special characters, but the logic used to generate the string does not guarantee that exactly `n` characters will be special. A more rigorous approach is needed to ensure that the generated string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.
