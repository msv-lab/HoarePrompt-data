Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even and non-negative for it to be possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the current implementation checks only if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, which is not sufficient. 

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. Here, `n - m = -2`, which satisfies the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, but it is impossible to end up with 4 cubes after 2 moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move. Thus, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for this case.
