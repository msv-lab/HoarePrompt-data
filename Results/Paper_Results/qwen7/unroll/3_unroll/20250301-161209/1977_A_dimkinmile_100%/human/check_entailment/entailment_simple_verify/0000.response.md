### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move involves adding or removing exactly one cube.
- **Constraints**: 
  - `1 ≤ t ≤ 100` (number of test cases)
  - `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100` (values for each test case)

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
   - Checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are true, prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, prints "No".

2. **Main Loop**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `kreker`.
   - Iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()`.

#### Annotations:
- **Initial State**: `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, and each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` such that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.
- **Postcondition**: After processing each test case, the program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.

#### Evaluation:
- **Condition Analysis**:
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
  - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

These conditions are necessary and sufficient for the problem because:
- If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `m` cubes.
- If `n - m` is odd or negative, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Given the constraints and the logic in the code, the program correctly handles all valid cases.

#### Example Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 0` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n - m = -2` (even but negative), so the output is "No".
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n - m = 2` (even and non-negative), so the output is "Yes".

The program correctly outputs "Yes" for valid cases and "No" for invalid cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given constraints.
