### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified the main issue correctly: the function `func_1()` is called without being defined. However, the logic within `func_1()` is actually correct for determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's break down the logic and verify it:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and then processes each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to process the input `n` and `m` and check the conditions.
   - The logic in `func_1()` is correct:
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the final and initial number of cubes is even.
     - `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is non-negative.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The program correctly reads `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly prints "Yes" if the conditions are met and "No" otherwise.

Given that the logic within `func_1()` is correct, the issue lies solely in the fact that `func_1()` is called without being defined. However, since the logic itself is correct, the program would work correctly if `func_1()` were defined properly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issue with the function definition, but the logic within `func_1()` is correct. Therefore, the program would be correct if `func_1()` were defined properly.

Correctness: **False**

End of Original Assessment

Final: **False**

The final evaluation is **False** because the program would be correct if the function `func_1()` were defined properly.
