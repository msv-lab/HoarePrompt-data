Output State: **The program returns a list of integers called `results` where each element is the value of `best_y` calculated for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the integer (where 1 < y < x) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`.**

This means that for each `x` in the `test_cases` list, the program finds the integer `y` (where `1 < y < x`) that gives the maximum value when added to its greatest common divisor with `x`. This `y` is then appended to the `results` list, and the final output is this list of `best_y` values.
