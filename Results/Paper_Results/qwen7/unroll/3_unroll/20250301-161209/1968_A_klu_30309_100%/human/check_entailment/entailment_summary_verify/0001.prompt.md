You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it calculates the integer `best_y` (where 1 < `y` < `x`) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`, and returns a list of these `best_y` values corresponding to each `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `x` for each test case.
   - This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(t, test_cases)` is defined to process each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.

3. **Finding the Best `y`:**
   - For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
   - It computes the sum `current_sum = gcd_val + y`.
   - If this sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary checks.

4. **Appending Results:**
   - After finding the best `y` for each `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

5. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints each element of the `results` list, which is correct.

### Verification:

- The logic for finding the best `y` is sound. It correctly maximizes the sum `gcd(x, y) + y` by checking all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
- The use of `break` ensures that the first `y` that gives the maximum sum is chosen, which is sufficient as per the problem statement.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by processing them sequentially.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the required `y` for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
