Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases, and `results` is a list of integers where each element is the value of `best_y` calculated for the corresponding `x` in `test_cases`. The calculation for each `x` involves finding the integer `y` (where 1 < y < x) that maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y`, and appending this `y` to the `results` list.
