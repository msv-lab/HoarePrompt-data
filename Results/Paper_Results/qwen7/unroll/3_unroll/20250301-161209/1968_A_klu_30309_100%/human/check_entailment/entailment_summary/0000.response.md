Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the list of integers (`test_cases`) from the input.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that processes each test case to find the optimal `y` for each `x`.
3. For each `x`, it iterates over all possible `y` values from `x-1` down to `1`, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd`.
4. It then checks if the sum of the GCD and `y` is greater than the current maximum sum. If so, it updates the maximum sum and records the current `y` as the best candidate.
5. The loop breaks early once a better candidate is found, ensuring efficiency.
6. The function returns a list of the best `y` values for each `x`.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to follow the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
