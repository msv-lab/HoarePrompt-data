Output State: `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing tuples of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, where each tuple corresponds to the values read from the input for each iteration of the loop, `n` is the number of elements in the array `arr` for each iteration, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input for each iteration, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input for each iteration, `input` is not yet defined, `idx` is equal to `t * 2 + 1`.
