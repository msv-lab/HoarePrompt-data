The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the size of an array, two integers representing Polycarp's favorite numbers, and the array itself. For each tuple, it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) in the array such that \(a \mod x\) equals \((-b \mod x + x) \mod x\) and \(a \mod y\) equals \(b \mod y\). It then returns a list of these counts for each test case.
