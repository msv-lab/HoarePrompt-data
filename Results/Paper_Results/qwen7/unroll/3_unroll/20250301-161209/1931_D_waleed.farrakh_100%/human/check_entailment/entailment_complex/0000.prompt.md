Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and n, x, and y satisfy the constraints 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.

    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the value of `count` calculated for each corresponding test case after executing the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the size of an array, two integers representing Polycarp's favorite numbers, and the array itself. For each tuple, it calculates the number of pairs (a, b) in the array such that \(a \mod x\) equals \((-b \mod x + x) \mod x\) and \(a \mod y\) equals \(b \mod y\). It then returns a list of these counts for each test case.

    #State: data is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, t is the first element of data converted to an integer, test_cases is a list containing tuples of integers where each tuple consists of n, x, y, and arr, results is the return value of func_1(test_cases), idx is equal to t * 2 + 1, the console has printed each result in the results list once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of inputs. Each set includes integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list \( arr \) of \( n \) integers. It calls another function `func_1` with the collected test cases and prints the results returned by `func_1`. The final state of the program includes the console output of the results for all test cases.
