### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
   - `rx` is essentially the remainder of `-a` when divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
   - `ry` is simply the remainder of `a` when divided by `y`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is used to store the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)` seen so far.
   - For each element `a` in the array, the program checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`.
   - If it does, it adds the frequency of that pair to the count `count`.

3. **Current Pair Calculation**:
   - The current pair is calculated as `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - This pair is then added to the frequency dictionary if it doesn't already exist.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code provides a clear step-by-step breakdown of the program's state and logic.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the conditions for a beautiful pair.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through an example to ensure the logic is correct.

**Example Input:**
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. **Initialize**:
   - `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`, `arr = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`
   - `freq = {}`
   - `count = 0`

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - For `a = 1`:
     - `rx = (-1 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 4`
     - `ry = 1 % 2 = 1`
     - `(4, 1)` is not in `freq`, so `freq[(4, 1)] = 1`
   - For `a = 2`:
     - `rx = (-2 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 3`
     - `ry = 2 % 2 = 0`
     - `(3, 0)` is not in `freq`, so `freq[(3, 0)] = 1`
   - For `a = 7`:
     - `rx = (-7 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 3`
     - `ry = 7 % 2 = 1`
     - `(3, 1)` is not in `freq`, so `freq[(3, 1)] = 1`
   - For `a = 4`:
     - `rx = (-4 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 1`
     - `ry = 4 % 2 = 0`
     - `(1, 0)` is not in `freq`, so `freq[(1, 0)] = 1`
   - For `a = 9`:
     - `rx = (-9 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 1`
     - `ry = 9 % 2 = 1`
     - `(1, 1)` is not in `freq`, so `freq[(1, 1)] = 1`
   - For `a = 6`:
     - `rx = (-6 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 4`
     - `ry = 6 % 2 = 0`
     - `(4, 0)` is not in `freq`, so `freq[(4, 0)] = 1`

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - Check `(4, 1)` in `freq`: Not found.
   - Check `(3, 0)` in `freq`: Not found.
   - Check `(3, 1)` in `freq`: Not found.
   - Check `(1, 0)` in `freq`: Not found.
   - Check `(1, 1)` in `freq`: Not found.
   - Check `(4, 0)` in `freq`: Not found.

4. **Result**:
   - No pairs match the conditions, so `count = 0`.

This matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. The annotated code and the step-by-step analysis confirm that the program works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
