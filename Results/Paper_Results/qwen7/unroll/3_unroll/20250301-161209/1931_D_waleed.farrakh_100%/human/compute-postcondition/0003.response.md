Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `test_cases` is an empty list, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `input` are not yet defined.**

The code initializes an empty list named `test_cases`. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, or `input`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
