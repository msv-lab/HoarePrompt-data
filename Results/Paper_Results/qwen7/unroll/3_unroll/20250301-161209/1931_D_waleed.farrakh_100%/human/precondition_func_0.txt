test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and n, x, and y satisfy the constraints 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
