To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze both `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it calculates the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and uses these frequencies to count the number of beautiful pairs.
3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, it computes `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count`.
   - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the dictionary.
4. **Appending Results**: After processing each test case, it appends the count of beautiful pairs to `results`.

### Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the input from standard input, splitting the lines into a list of strings.
2. **Extracting Test Cases**: It extracts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. **Calling `func_1`**: It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and stores the results.
4. **Printing Results**: It prints each result from the `results` list.

### Verification Against Provided Examples

Let's verify the solution using the provided examples:

```python
test_cases = [
    (6, 5, 2, [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]),
    (7, 9, 5, [1, 10, 15, 3, 8, 12, 15]),
    (9, 4, 10, [14, 10, 2, 2, 11, 11, 13, 5, 6]),
    (9, 5, 6, [10, 7, 6, 7, 9, 7, 7, 10, 10]),
    (9, 6, 2, [4, 9, 7, 1, 2, 2, 13, 3, 15]),
    (9, 2, 3, [14, 6, 1, 15, 12, 15, 8, 2, 15]),
    (10, 5, 7, [13, 3, 3, 2, 12, 11, 3, 7, 13, 14])
]

expected_output = [2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 0]

results = func_1(test_cases)
print(results == expected_output)
```

Running the above code should give `True` if the implementation is correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
