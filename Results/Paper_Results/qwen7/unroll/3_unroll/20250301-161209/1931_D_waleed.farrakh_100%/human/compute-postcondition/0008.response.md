Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input along line breaks, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing tuples of integers where each tuple consists of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `idx` is equal to `t * 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `results = func_1(test_cases)` calls the function `func_1` with `test_cases` as its argument and assigns the return value to `results`. The values of `data`, `t`, `test_cases`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial state.
