Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the value of \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\) and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each test case.**
