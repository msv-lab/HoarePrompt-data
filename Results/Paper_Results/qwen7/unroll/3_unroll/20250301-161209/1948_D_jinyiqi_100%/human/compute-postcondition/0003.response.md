Output State: The output state depends on the input string `s`. The loop checks for substrings of length `j` where each character matches the corresponding character `j` positions ahead (with '?' acting as a wildcard). If such a substring of length `j` is found, it prints `2 * j` and returns. Therefore, the output could be any value of the form `2 * j` where `1 ≤ j ≤ n // 2`, or no output at all if no such matching substrings exist.
