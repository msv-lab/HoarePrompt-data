You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: `answers` is a list containing the outcomes ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') for each iteration of the loop based on the input provided during the loop's execution. The exact contents of the list depend on the input values given for each test case within the specified range (1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4).

    #State: The output state will be a series of lines, each containing one element from the `answers` list, printed in the order they appear in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). It checks specific conditions and based on the values of these integers, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or a Draw occurs. The function then prints the outcome for each test case in the order they were processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly implements the rules of the game and produces the expected outcomes.

1. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if Alice's initial row `x_a` is greater than Bob's initial row `x_b` or if Alice is in the last row (`h`). If either condition is true, the game is a draw.
   
2. **Parity Check**:
   - The program checks the parity (odd/even) of Alice's and Bob's initial rows. If both are even or both are odd, it proceeds to further checks.
   - If Alice's and Bob's initial rows have different parities, the program directly assigns the result based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob.

3. **Relative Position Checks**:
   - The program checks the relative positions of Alice and Bob's initial columns (`y_a` and `y_b`). It uses these positions to determine if Alice or Bob can force a win or if the game results in a draw.

4. **Detailed Logic Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: Alice's row > Bob's row or Alice is in the last row.
     - If this condition is met, the game is a draw.
   - **Case 2**: Parity Check:
     - If both rows have the same parity, the program checks the relative positions of the columns.
       - If Alice and Bob are in the same column, Bob wins.
       - If Alice is to the left of Bob, the program checks if the distance between them is more than 1. If so, the game is a draw; otherwise, Bob wins.
       - If Alice is to the right of Bob, similar checks are made, but the logic is slightly different due to the direction of movement.
   - **Case 3**: Different Parity:
     - If Alice and Bob have different parities, the program directly assigns the result based on the relative positions of the columns.

### Testing Against Provided Examples:

The program seems to handle the basic cases correctly, but let's verify against the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Expected Output: `Alice`
   - Explanation: Alice starts in row 2, and Bob starts in row 5. Since Alice's row is less than Bob's, Alice can move down to row 3, and Bob cannot block her from winning by moving up. Hence, Alice wins.

2. **Example 2**: 
   - Input: `4 1 2 1 4 1`
   - Expected Output: `Bob`
   - Explanation: Alice starts in row 2, and Bob starts in row 4. Since Alice's row is less than Bob's, Alice cannot move down without losing, and Bob can always move up to block Alice. Hence, Bob wins.

3. **Example 3**: 
   - Input: `1 4 1 3 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `Draw`
   - Explanation: Alice starts in row 1, and Bob starts in row 1. Since both start in the same row, the game is a draw.

4. **Example 4**: 
   - Input: `5 5 1 4 5 2`
   - Expected Output: `Draw`
   - Explanation: Alice starts in row 1, and Bob starts in row 5. Since Alice is in the first row, she cannot move down, and Bob cannot move up. Hence, the game is a draw.

After verifying the logic and testing against the provided examples, the program appears to handle the game rules correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game rules and produces the expected outcomes based on the provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
