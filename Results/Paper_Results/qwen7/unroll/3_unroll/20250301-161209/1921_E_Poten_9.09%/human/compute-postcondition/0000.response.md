Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. Since the input is an integer within the specified range, the output state reflects this. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be consistent with the given conditions.
