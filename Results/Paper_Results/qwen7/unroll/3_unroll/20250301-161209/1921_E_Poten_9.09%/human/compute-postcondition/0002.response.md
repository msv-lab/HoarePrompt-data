State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `i < test_cases` must be true.
3. Since `i` starts at 0, the smallest value for `test_cases` that allows the loop to execute is 1.
4. Therefore, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
5. The initial state of `answers` as an empty list does not affect the loop's execution condition directly, but it is included in the state for completeness.

Thus, the required adjustments are to set `i` to 0 and ensure `test_cases` is greater than 0.
