Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on both sides of the road are satisfied. The satisfaction condition is that at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents on each side must want to live on that side.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - **func_1()**: This function processes a single test case.
     - It reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `a`.
     - It calculates the cumulative counts of `0`s (left side) and `1`s (right side) using a list `S`. This list `S` keeps track of the prefix sums of `0`s and `1`s.
     - It iterates through each position `i` from `0` to `n-1` and checks if placing the road at `i` satisfies the condition.
       - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of `0`s (`left`) and `1`s (`right`) on the left and right sides respectively.
       - It checks if the conditions \(2 \times \text{left} \geq \text{lsum}\) and \(2 \times \text{right} \geq \text{rsum}\) are met, where `lsum` is the total number of residents on the left side and `rsum` is the total number of residents on the right side.
       - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village or if it is equally close but smaller than the previous answer.
   - **func_2()**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly calculates the cumulative counts and checks the conditions for each position `i`.
   - The logic for updating the answer `ans` ensures that the chosen position is the closest to the middle of the village while satisfying the conditions.
   - The code handles all the given constraints and examples correctly.

Based on the analysis, the given code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
