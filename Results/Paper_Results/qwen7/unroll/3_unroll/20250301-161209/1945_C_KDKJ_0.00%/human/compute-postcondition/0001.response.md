Output State: **a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', unchanged.**

Explanation: The given loop does not modify the variable `a`. It only calls a function `func_1()` for a number of times equal to the user's input. Since the problem statement does not provide any details about what `func_1()` does, we can only conclude that `a` remains unchanged because no operations are performed on it within the loop.
