Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `c` is 0, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `l`. None of the other variables (`ma`, `mi`, `m`, `s`, `c`, `d`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their initial values.
