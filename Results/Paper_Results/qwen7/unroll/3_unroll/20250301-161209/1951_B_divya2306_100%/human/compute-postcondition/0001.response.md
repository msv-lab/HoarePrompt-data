Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct, n and k are assigned the values from input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `n` is updated to the first value read from the input. All `a_i` values are distinct integers between 1 and 10^9, as specified in the initial state.
