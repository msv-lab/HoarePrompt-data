Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions given in the loop body. For each test case, the output will be either the value of `k`, `1`, or a specific derived value from `k` depending on whether `k` is a power of 2, odd, or neither. Specifically:

- If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`.
- If `k` is odd, it prints `1`.
- If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, subtracts it from `k`, and continues to do so until `k` becomes a power of 2, then prints the final value of `k`.

Each line of output corresponds to the result of one test case processed by the loop.
