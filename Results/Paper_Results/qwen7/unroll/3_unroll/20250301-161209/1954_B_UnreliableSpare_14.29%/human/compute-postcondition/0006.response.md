Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')**.

The code initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`, which does not affect the values of `flag`, `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `ans` is explicitly set to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
