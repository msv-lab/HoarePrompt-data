Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and arr is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The length of `arr` is equal to `n`. The values of `t` and the previous value of `n` remain unchanged.
