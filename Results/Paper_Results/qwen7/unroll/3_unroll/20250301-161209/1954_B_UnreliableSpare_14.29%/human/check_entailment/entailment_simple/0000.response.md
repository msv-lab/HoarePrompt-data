Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes one test case.
   - It first checks if the array is already non-beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any two consecutive elements are different, it immediately prints `-1` and returns because no further removals are needed.
   - If the array is beautiful, it calculates the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element (`val`) in the array (`cnt`). This is done by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that match the first element.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value between the initial value of `ans` (which is set to infinity) and `cnt`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies if the array is already non-beautiful and prints `-1` in such cases.
   - For a beautiful array, the code correctly calculates the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element and uses this to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` for `ans` ensures that the comparison logic works as intended.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the required logic without any apparent errors.

Correctness: **True**
