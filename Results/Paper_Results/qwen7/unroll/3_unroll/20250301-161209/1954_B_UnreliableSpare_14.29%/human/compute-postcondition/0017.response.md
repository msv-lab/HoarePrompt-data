Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and an array. It processes these inputs to determine a result for each test case according to the specified conditions.
