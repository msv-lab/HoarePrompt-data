Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` and the variable `cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `c`**: The loop starts with `c` being set to 0 (since `range(cases)` generates values from 0 to cases-1).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `c` is less than `cases`.

4. **Initial state of `cases`**: The problem states that `cases` is an input integer.

5. **Initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

6. **Adjust the states needed for the loop to execute**: Since the loop will execute if `c < cases`, we need to ensure that `c` is 0 initially and `cases` is at least 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `c` and `cases`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`c` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0**
