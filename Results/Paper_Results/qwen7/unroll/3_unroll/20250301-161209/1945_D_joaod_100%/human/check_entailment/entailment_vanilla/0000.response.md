Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads `n` and `m`, and the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - It correctly adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from both, which aligns with the problem statement where positions start from 1.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which is correct.
   - `best` is set to a very large value (`sys.float_info.max`), which is a good practice to ensure that any computed value will be smaller initially.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.
   - It checks if the current position `v` is within the allowed final position `pos_final`.
     - If `v` is within `pos_final`, it updates `best` and `total` based on whether swapping or passing is cheaper.
     - If `v` is beyond `pos_final`, it only adds the cost of passing to `total`.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating `total` and `best` seems to handle both swapping and passing costs correctly.
   - The conditions for swapping versus passing are correctly applied.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the `best` value, which is the minimum cost calculated.

### Edge Cases and Validation:
- The program handles the backward iteration and conditional checks appropriately.
- The use of `sys.float_info.max` ensures that the initial comparison is valid.
- The program correctly handles the transition between swapping and passing based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
