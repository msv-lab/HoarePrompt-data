Output State: The value of `t` after all iterations of the loop have finished, which is the minimum cost calculated for each test case. Each test case's cost is determined by the logic inside the loop, considering whether it's cheaper to swap or pass through each position. The final output for each test case is printed, and after all test cases, `t` will hold the last computed minimum cost.
