Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n` and checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2` (the sum of the first `n` natural numbers) is greater than `i * n`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required (`n + r`).
   - It then performs the operations:
     - For the first `n` operations (if `r` is 0, it will be `n`), it performs Type 1 operations.
     - For the remaining `r` operations, it performs Type 2 operations.

4. **Type 1 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first row to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Type 2 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Verification

#### Correctness of the Logic

- The logic for calculating the maximum sum seems correct. The sum is calculated based on the largest possible values that can be placed in the matrix without exceeding the constraints.
- The number of operations is correctly set to `n + r`, where `r` is the smallest integer such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

#### Implementation Details

- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The operations performed are indeed Type 1 and Type 2 operations as specified in the problem statement.
- The operations are performed in such a way that the sum of the matrix elements is maximized.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations within the constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
