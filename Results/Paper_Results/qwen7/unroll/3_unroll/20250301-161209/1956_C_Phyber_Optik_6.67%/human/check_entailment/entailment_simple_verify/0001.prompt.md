You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, there will be two lines:
    #
    #1. The first line contains two integers: the value of `sum` and `n + r`.
    #2. The second line contains either `n` or `n + r` lines, each representing a sequence of numbers. Each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by a space-separated list of numbers from `1` to `n`.
    #
    #For each iteration, `sum` is calculated based on the given logic, and `r` is determined by the condition in the inner loop. The exact values of `sum` and `r` depend on the input `n` for each iteration. The second part of the output generates a specific pattern of numbers based on the values of `n` and `r`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n` and checks if `n * (n + 1) // 2` (the sum of the first `n` natural numbers) is greater than `i * n`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets `r` to `i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required (`n + r`).
   - It then performs the operations:
     - For the first `n` operations (if `r` is 0, it will be `n`), it performs Type 1 operations.
     - For the remaining `r` operations, it performs Type 2 operations.

4. **Type 1 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first row to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Type 2 Operations:**
   - For each operation, it sets the entire first column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Verification

#### Correctness of the Logic

- The logic for calculating the maximum sum seems correct. The sum is calculated based on the largest possible values that can be placed in the matrix without exceeding the constraints.
- The number of operations is correctly set to `n + r`, where `r` is the smallest integer such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

#### Implementation Details

- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- The operations performed are indeed Type 1 and Type 2 operations as specified in the problem statement.
- The operations are performed in such a way that the sum of the matrix elements is maximized.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations within the constraints.
