Reasoning:
- The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
- The provided code seems to calculate the sum of the matrix and determine the number of operations needed, but it does not correctly implement the logic for performing the operations to maximize the sum.

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation part seems to be incorrect. The logic for calculating the sum and determining \( r \) is flawed. Specifically, the sum should be calculated by filling the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum, which is not done here.
3. **Printing Output**: The code prints the sum and \( n + r \) for each test case, but the values of \( r \) and the sum are not derived correctly. Additionally, the pattern of numbers printed does not reflect the required operations to achieve the maximum sum.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Fill the matrix such that the sum is maximized.
- Use at most \( 2n \) operations to achieve this.

Here's a corrected approach:
1. Fill the first \( n \) rows with the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
2. Fill the remaining rows (if any) by permuting the columns to maximize the sum.

Given this, the provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly fill the matrix to maximize the sum and does not follow the required operations.

Correctness: **False**
