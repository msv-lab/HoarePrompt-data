Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; n is not defined**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the range 1 to 50, inclusive, that is the new value of `t`. The variable `n` is not defined or affected by this line of code.
