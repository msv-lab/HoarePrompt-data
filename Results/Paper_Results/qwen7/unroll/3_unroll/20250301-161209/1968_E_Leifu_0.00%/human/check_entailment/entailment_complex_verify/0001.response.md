### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program needs to output a configuration of \(n\) cells that achieves this.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which will always contribute a Manhattan distance of 1.
   - If `n` is 3, it adds the point `(2, 3)`, contributing additional distances.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(1, 4)` and then prints points `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`.

3. **Checking for Distinct Manhattan Distances**:
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - Distances: 1.
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{1\}\).
     - The program correctly outputs two points, but it does not maximize the number of distinct distances. The maximum possible \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is \(\{0, 1\}\) (by placing points \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\)).
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
     - Distances: 1, 2, and 3.
     - \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2, 3\}\).
     - The program correctly outputs three points, but it does not maximize the number of distinct distances. The maximum possible \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) (by placing points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 1)\)).
   - For \(n > 3\):
     - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) contribute a distance of 1.
     - The point \((2, 4)\) contributes a distance of 3.
     - Points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) will contribute distances of \(j-1\) and \(2(j-1)\).
     - However, the program does not consider other configurations that might yield more distinct distances. For example, for \(n = 4\), the optimal configuration would include points like \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((4, 3)\), which would give \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).

4. **Verification**:
   - The program does not handle all possible configurations to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. It only considers specific points and does not explore other potential configurations that could yield more distinct distances.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all test cases to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
