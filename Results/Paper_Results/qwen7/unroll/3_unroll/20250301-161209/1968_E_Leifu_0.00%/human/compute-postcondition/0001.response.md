State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `i` must be 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires `t` to be at least 1.
- The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to 0 and ensure `t` is a valid integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
