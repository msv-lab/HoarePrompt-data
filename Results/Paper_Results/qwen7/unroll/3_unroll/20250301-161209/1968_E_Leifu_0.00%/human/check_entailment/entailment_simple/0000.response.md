Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to generate a set of points that might maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.
3. Let's analyze the program step-by-step:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which are always included.
   - If `n` is 3, it prints `(2, 3)`. This is a valid configuration for \(n = 3\) as it provides three distinct distances: 0, 1, and 3.
   - For \(n > 3\), it prints `(2, 4)` followed by points `(j, j)` for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\). This configuration ensures a variety of distances, including larger values like \(n-1\).

However, the program does not consider all possible configurations that could maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 4\), the provided configuration only gives distances {0, 1, 2, 3}, but a better configuration would include points like `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 2)`, and `(4, 4)`, which would give a larger set of distinct distances.

Given these considerations, the program does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
