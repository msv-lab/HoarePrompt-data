Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, two integers n and m, and a list a containing n integers. For each test case, it reverses the digits of each integer in the list, sorts the reversed integers, and then reconstructs a new string by alternating between the sorted reversed integers and their original reversed forms. Finally, it compares this reconstructed string (converted to an integer) with \(10^{max\_power}\), where \(max\_power\) is derived from the input. If the reconstructed string is greater, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.**
