Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversals**: The code reverses the digits of the numbers but does not properly account for the game rules where Anna reverses the digits and Sasha concatenates two numbers. The `rev_res` variable is used incorrectly and does not reflect the state of the list after Anna's moves.

2. **Game Logic Implementation**: The game logic should simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha. The current implementation does not simulate these turns correctly. Instead, it attempts to create a single string from the reversed numbers, which is not how the game works.

3. **Winning Condition Check**: The winning condition check is done at the end without considering the game turns. The game continues until Sasha cannot make a move, and the final state determines the winner.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha and keep track of the list state after each move. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        operational_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Anna's turn: Reverse the digits of each number
        operational_list = [int(str(num)[::-1]) for num in operational_list]
        
        # Sasha's turn: Concatenate two numbers if possible
        while len(operational_list) > 1:
            a = operational_list.pop(0)
            b = operational_list.pop(0)
            new_num = int(f"{a}{b}")
            operational_list.append(new_num)
        
        # Check the final number
        if 10 ** m <= operational_list[0]:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')

func()
```

This code correctly simulates the game turns and checks the final state to determine the winner.
