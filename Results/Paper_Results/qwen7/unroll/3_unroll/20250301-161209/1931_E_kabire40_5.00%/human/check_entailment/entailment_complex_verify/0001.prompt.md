You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: Output State: Sasha or Anna, depending on the input values provided during the loop executions. The final output will be either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' based on the comparison between `rev_res` and `10 ** int(max_power)`. If `rev_res` is greater than `10 ** int(max_power)`, 'Sasha' is printed; otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, two integers n and m, and a list a containing n integers. For each test case, it reverses the digits of each integer in the list, sorts the reversed integers, and then reconstructs a new string by alternating between the sorted reversed integers and their original reversed forms. Finally, it compares this reconstructed string (converted to an integer) with \(10^{max\_power}\), where \(max\_power\) is derived from the input. If the reconstructed string is greater, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers.

2. **Reversing Elements:**
   - The program reverses each element in the list and checks if the length of the reversed element is the same as the original element.
   - If the lengths are the same, it appends the reversed element to `rev_res` without modification.
   - If the lengths differ, it appends the reversed element to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Reconstructing:**
   - The `rev_val` list is sorted.
   - The program then reconstructs `rev_res` by alternating between elements from `rev_val` and their reversed forms.

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - Finally, it checks if the constructed string `rev_res` is greater than \(10^m\).
   - If it is, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversed Elements:**
   - The program should only append the reversed form of elements whose length has changed. However, it incorrectly appends the reversed form even if the length remains the same.

2. **Reconstruction Logic:**
   - The reconstruction logic is flawed because it alternates between elements and their reversed forms without considering the actual game rules. Specifically, Sasha and Anna take turns making moves according to the game rules, not just concatenating elements.

3. **Game Rules Not Implemented:**
   - The program does not simulate the game turns where Sasha and Anna make their respective moves. Instead, it simply constructs a string based on the reversed elements.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The final check to determine the winner is based on the constructed string `rev_res`, which does not reflect the actual game state after optimal play by both players.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
