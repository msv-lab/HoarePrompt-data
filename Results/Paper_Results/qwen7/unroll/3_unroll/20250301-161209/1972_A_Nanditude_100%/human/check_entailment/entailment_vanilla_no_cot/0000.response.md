Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution attempts to count how many times `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, but this approach does not account for the fact that after inserting a new problem, the array `a` needs to be sorted and the last element removed. 

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        i = 0
        for j in range(n):
            while i < n and a[i] <= b[j]:
                i += 1
            if i == n:
                break
            cnt += 1
            a.insert(i, float('inf'))
            a.sort()
            a.pop()
        print(cnt)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: Read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, read the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Counting Operations**: Initialize a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of operations needed.
3. **Iterate Over `b`**: For each value in `b`, use a while loop to find the position `i` where `a[i]` exceeds `b[j]`.
4. **Insert and Sort**: If such a position is found, increment the counter `cnt`. Insert a very large number (`float('inf')`) at position `i` to simulate the insertion of a new problem, sort the array `a`, and then remove the last element.
5. **Output**: Print the total number of operations required.

This approach ensures that the array `a` is always maintained in a sorted order and that the condition `a[i] <= b[i]` is checked after each insertion and sorting operation.
