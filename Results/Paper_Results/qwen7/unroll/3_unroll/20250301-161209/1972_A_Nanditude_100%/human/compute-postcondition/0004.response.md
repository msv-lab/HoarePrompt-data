Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through arrays a and b of length n, where each element in a and b is a positive integer. The function checks if the elements in array a are non-decreasing and elements in array b are non-decreasing, with both arrays having lengths between 1 and 100 and elements between 1 and 10^9. Based on these conditions, the function does not return any specific value but rather validates the input arrays according to the given constraints.**
