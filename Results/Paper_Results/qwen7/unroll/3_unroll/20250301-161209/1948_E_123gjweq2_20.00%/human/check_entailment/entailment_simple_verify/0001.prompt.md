You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of cliques needed (`cliques`) using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates over the range of `cliques`.
   - For each clique, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - The `make_array` function is responsible for assigning values to the array segments corresponding to each clique.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on the `left` and `right` indices.
   - It splits the segment `[left, right]` into two parts: one with `mid` elements and another with `not_mid` elements.
   - It assigns values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays accordingly.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliquess` Array**:
   - In the `make_array` function, the `cliquess` array is being updated inside the loop where `arr` is being filled.
   - However, the `cliquess` array should be updated after all elements in the segment are assigned, not during the assignment process.
   - This could lead to incorrect values in the `cliquess` array.

2. **Assignment Logic**:
   - The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` seems correct but needs to ensure that the values are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
   - The current implementation might not guarantee distinct values for all cases, especially when `k` is large.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not handle the output format correctly. It prints `cliques` and `cliquess` directly without ensuring they meet the required conditions.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    # Calculate the number of cliques
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    
    # Initialize arrays
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    
    # Assign values to arr and cliquess
    for i in range(cliques):
        start = i * k
        end = min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)
        
        # Assign values to arr
        for j in range(start, end + 1):
            arr[j] = j - start + 1
        
        # Assign clique index to cliquess
        for j in range(start, end + 1):
            cliquess[j] = i + 1
    
    # Print the results
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

### Conclusion

The original program had issues with the `cliquess` array and the assignment logic. After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected. Therefore, the original program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
