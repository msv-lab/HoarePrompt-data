Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1, with corresponding `cliquess` values for these indices set to `clique`. All other elements in `arr` and `cliquess` remain unchanged.
