Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph and then partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on a specific condition. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle this logic, and `make_array` is a helper function used within `func_1`.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)` calculates the minimum number of cliques needed.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized as arrays of zeros.
   - The function iterates over each clique and calls `make_array` to populate `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.
   - `make_array` correctly fills `arr` and `cliquess` based on the specified rules.

3. **Verification**:
   - The `make_array` function ensures that elements within each segment `[left, right]` are assigned distinct values and placed in the same clique.
   - The assignment of elements to cliques follows the rule that for any two vertices \(i\) and \(j\), if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\), they must be in the same clique.
   - The output format matches the required format: the values assigned to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partitioning of vertices into cliques.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
