The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers where `left` is less than `right`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function does not explicitly return anything in the given information, but based on typical array creation practices, it likely creates an array (or list) of integers starting from `left` up to `right-1`. The array might also include additional information related to the `clique` identifier.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `left` and `right` where `left` is less than `right`, and an integer `clique` representing the clique identifier. It returns an array (or list) of integers starting from `left` up to `right-1`, potentially including information related to the `clique` identifier.**
