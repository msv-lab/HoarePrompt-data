### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Clustering Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
- **Array Initialization**: It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.

#### Function `make_array`:
- **Segment Assignment**: The function attempts to assign values to segments of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
- **Issues Identified**:
  - **Cliquess Array Update**: The original assessment correctly pointed out that the `cliquess` array is being updated incorrectly. Instead of updating `cliquess` after assigning values to `arr`, it should be done simultaneously.
  - **Value Assignment**: The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` needs to ensure that the values are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.

#### Corrected Program:
- The corrected program ensures that the `cliquess` array is updated correctly and simultaneously with the `arr` array.
- The assignment logic guarantees distinct values for all cases.

#### Output Format:
- The program now correctly prints the values of `arr`, `cliques`, and `cliquess` in the required format.

Given the corrections and the analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect due to the issues with the `cliquess` array update and the potential lack of distinct values.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly update the `cliquess` array and may not guarantee distinct values for all cases.
