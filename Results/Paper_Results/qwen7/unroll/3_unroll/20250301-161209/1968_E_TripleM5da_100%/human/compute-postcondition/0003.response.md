Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers, t and n, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. It does not return any value directly but seems to perform some operations based on these parameters.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes or performs some operations involving the integers t and n, though the exact nature of these operations is not specified in the provided information.
