Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it prints the coordinates of \( n \) cells.
   - Specifically, it prints:
     - (1, 1)
     - (1, 2)
     - For \( i \) from 3 to \( n \), it prints (i, i).

3. **Checking the Output for Different Values of \( n \)**:
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The cells are (1, 1) and (1, 2).
     - Distances: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
     - Set of distances: \(\{0, 1\}\). Size is 2.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The cells are (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3).
     - Distances: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \), \( |1-1| + |1-3| = 2 \), \( |1-1| + |3-3| = 0 \), \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 2 \), \( |1-2| + |3-3| = 2 \), \( |1-3| + |3-3| = 2 \), \( |2-3| + |1-3| = 1 \), \( |2-3| + |3-3| = 1 \).
     - Set of distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\). Size is 3.
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The cells are (1, 1), (1, 2), (4, 4), and (4, 3).
     - Distances include all possible values up to \( n-1 \), ensuring the maximum number of distinct distances.
   - For larger \( n \), the pattern continues to ensure a large set of distinct distances.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly places the cells to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for various \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
