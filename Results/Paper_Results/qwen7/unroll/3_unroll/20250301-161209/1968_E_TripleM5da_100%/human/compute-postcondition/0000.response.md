Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < int(input())`.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` must be a valid integer input that determines the number of iterations.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `t` is given as a possible value for `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is within the range \(2 \leq \text{int(input())} \leq 10^3\).
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches the value of `int(input())`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `int(input())` must be a valid integer input within the range \(2 \leq \text{int(input())} \leq 10^3\).
- `i` should start at 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`int(input())` must be an integer within the range 2 to 10^3, `i` is 0**
