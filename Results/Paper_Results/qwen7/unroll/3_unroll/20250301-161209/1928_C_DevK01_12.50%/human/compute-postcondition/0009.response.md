Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where both are integers. `q` represents the position Vasya occupied in the line, and `x` represents the number Vasya received during the settling. The function returns a list `M` containing integers `i` and `q//i` for each `i` in the range from 1 to the integer part of `w // 1` (where `w` is a variable not defined in the given context but implied to be related to `q`), such that either `i` or `q//i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
