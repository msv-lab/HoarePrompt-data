The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes a permutation `p` of length `n`, an array `a` of length `n`, and four positive integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`. It calculates the maximum possible sums `resb` and `ress` that two players, Bodya and Sasha, can achieve starting from positions `P_B` and `P_S` respectively, over `k` steps. Based on these sums, it prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" to indicate which player has the higher sum or if they are equal.
