Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to calculate the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules of the game.
2. The program correctly initializes variables and reads input as specified.
3. It constructs the paths for both players using a loop that ensures no position is revisited, adhering to the rule that the permutation must not revisit any index.
4. The scoring logic is implemented correctly, where the score is accumulated by adding the value at the current position and then moving to the next position according to the permutation.
5. The program uses dynamic programming to compute the maximum possible scores for both players up to `k` steps.
6. The comparison of the final scores is done accurately, and the appropriate output ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw") is printed based on the comparison.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement and the execution summary accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or discrepancies in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
