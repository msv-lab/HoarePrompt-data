Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the loop calculates whether "Bodya" or "Sasha" has a higher result based on the given conditions and prints either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw". The final output state is a series of printed results, one for each input provided, indicating which of "Bodya" or "Sasha" has a higher result or if they are equal.
