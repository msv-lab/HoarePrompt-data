Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Variable Naming and Logic**: The variables `YES` and `NO` are defined but never used. The logic for determining the winner should use the variables `resb` and `ress` correctly.
2. **Loop Conditions and Break Statements**: The loop conditions and break statements are not correctly implemented. The loops should iterate until they reach the end of the path or the number of turns `k` is exhausted.
3. **Score Calculation**: The score calculation logic is flawed. The scores should be calculated based on the accumulated points from the path, considering the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
4. **Output Statements**: The output statements should directly print "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" without any additional characters or spaces.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        def calculate_score(start):
            path = []
            visited = [0] * n
            current = start - 1
            score = 0
            while True:
                path.append(a[current])
                visited[current] = 1
                current = p[current] - 1
                if visited[current] == 1:
                    break
            for i in range(len(path)):
                if k < i + 1:
                    break
                score += path[i] * (k - i)
            return score

        resb = calculate_score(pb)
        ress = calculate_score(ps)

        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the scores for both players and determines the winner based on the given rules.
