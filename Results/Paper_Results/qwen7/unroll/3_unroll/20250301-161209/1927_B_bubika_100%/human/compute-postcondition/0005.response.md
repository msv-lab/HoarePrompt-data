Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then maps each integer in the list to a corresponding character in the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and constructs a string based on these characters. Finally, it prints the constructed string for each test case.**
