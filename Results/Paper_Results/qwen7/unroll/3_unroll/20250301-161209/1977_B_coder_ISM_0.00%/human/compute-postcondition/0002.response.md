Output State: t lines of operations where each line contains a sequence of characters ('0', '1', or '-1') representing the binary representation of the input number with potential modifications according to the rules inside the loop, followed by an integer indicating the new length of the sequence after processing. The exact sequences and lengths depend on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop.
