Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it initializes an empty list `s` and sets the length to 30.
3. It iterates through the bits of `x` from the least significant bit to the most significant bit (up to 29th bit), appending '1' or '0' to the list `s` based on whether the corresponding bit is set in `x`.
4. After constructing the initial binary representation, it attempts to modify the representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. This is done by checking for consecutive '1's and converting them to '-1' and '0', respectively, while also ensuring the final element is not zero.
5. The program then prints the length of the modified list and the list itself, which represents the desired array.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the specified rules and generate valid outputs for each test case. The modifications made to the binary representation ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist, and the length of the array is within the required bounds.

Correctness: **True**
