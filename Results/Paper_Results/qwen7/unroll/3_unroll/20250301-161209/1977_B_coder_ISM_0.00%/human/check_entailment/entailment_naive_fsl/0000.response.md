Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies all the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \leq i \leq n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\).

Consider the test case \(x = 15\). The correct output should be:
```
4
-1 0 0 1
```
However, the provided program generates:
```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```
This output is incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero elements \(-1\) and \(1\), violating the condition that no two consecutive non-zero elements should exist.

Another example is \(x = 27\). The correct output should be:
```
5
-1 0 -1 0 1
```
But the program generates:
```
6
-1 0 -1 0 0 1
```
Again, this output is incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero elements \(-1\) and \(1\).

These examples demonstrate that the program does not always generate a valid array according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
