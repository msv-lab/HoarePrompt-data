Reasoning:
1. **Binary Representation**: The program correctly converts the integer \( x \) into a binary representation of 30 bits. This part is correct because the loop iterates over 30 bits and appends '1' or '0' to the list `s` based on whether \( x \) has the bit set at position \( i \).

2. **Modification Rules**: The program attempts to modify the binary representation according to the specified rules:
   - If there are consecutive non-zero bits, it changes them to alternate between '-1' and '0'.
   - If the last bit is '0' and the previous bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and the second last bit to '-1'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the last bit is '0' and the second last bit is '1', it correctly handles the case by changing the last bit to '1' and possibly increasing the length to 31.
   - The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist, which aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the modified array and the array itself, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem's constraints and requirements accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
