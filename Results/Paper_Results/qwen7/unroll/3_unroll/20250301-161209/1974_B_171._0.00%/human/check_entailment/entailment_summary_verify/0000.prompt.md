You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` which is the result of encoding some original string using a specific algorithm. It then decodes the `encoded` string by mapping each character back to its original form and constructs a new string `decoded`. Finally, it returns this decoded string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string but does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the program generates a mapping of characters from 'a' to 'z' to the characters in the encoded string, but it does not ensure that the mapping is consistent with the encoding process described. 

In the encoding process, each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of `s` sorted alphabetically. However, the provided program does not construct the string `r` and does not correctly map the characters from the encoded string back to the original characters.

For example, consider the input:
- Encoded string: `"serofedsoc"`
- Decoding should produce: `"codeforces"`

The program fails to correctly decode the string because it does not properly handle the symmetric mapping. Instead of finding the correct symmetric character, it simply appends the next available character from 'a' to 'z', which leads to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program needs to first construct the string `r` from the encoded string and then create a mapping for the symmetric characters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Find all unique characters in the encoded string
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected version constructs the string `r` from the unique characters in the encoded string and then creates a mapping for the symmetric characters, ensuring the correct decoding.
