Output State: `mapping` is a dictionary where each key from 'a' to 'z' maps to a unique character from the `encoded` string, and `decoded` is a list containing the characters from `encoded` based on their mappings in `mapping`. If a character in `encoded` does not have a mapping, it is assigned the next available lowercase letter and then mapped.
