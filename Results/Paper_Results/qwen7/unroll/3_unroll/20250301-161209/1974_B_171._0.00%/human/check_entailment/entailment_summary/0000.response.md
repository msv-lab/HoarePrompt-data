Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode an encoded string by constructing a mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the original string. However, there is a fundamental flaw in how the mapping is constructed and used.

1. **Mapping Construction**: The program tries to find the first available character in the alphabet that is not already mapped to any other character in the encoded string. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly reflect the relationship between characters in the encoded string and their original counterparts. Specifically, the mapping should be based on the reverse order of the unique characters in the encoded string.

2. **Decoding Process**: During the decoding process, the program appends characters to the `decoded` list based on the mapping. If a character is not found in the mapping, it assumes the next available character in the alphabet. This approach is incorrect because it does not follow the intended encoding logic.

To correctly decode the string, we need to:
- Construct a mapping where each character in the encoded string is paired with its corresponding character in the original string.
- Use the reverse order of the unique characters in the encoded string to create this mapping.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create a list of unique characters in the encoded string sorted in reverse order
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded), reverse=True)
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[i] for i, char in enumerate(encoded)}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

With this corrected approach, the program should correctly decode the encoded string according to the specified algorithm.

Correctness: **False**
