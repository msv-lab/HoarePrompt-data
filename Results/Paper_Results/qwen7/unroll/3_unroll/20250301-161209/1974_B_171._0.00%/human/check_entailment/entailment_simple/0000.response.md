Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` aims to decode the encoded string back to the original string `s`.
2. It initializes an empty dictionary `mapping` to store the reverse mapping from each character in the alphabet to a character in the encoded string.
3. It iterates through each character in the encoded string:
   - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
   - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it finds the next available character in the alphabet that hasn't been mapped yet and adds it to the `mapping` with the current encoded character.
4. Finally, it joins the `decoded` list into a string and returns it.

Given the problem description and the steps in the function, the logic appears to correctly map each character in the encoded string back to its original character in the alphabetically ordered set of unique characters from the original string `s`.

Therefore, the function should correctly decode the encoded string.

Correctness: **True**
