You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the array \( a \). If no such segment exists, it outputs -1. The function does not return any parameters but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observation**: For an array to be beautiful, there must be at least one position `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. This means that adjacent pairs of elements must be equal at some points in the array.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided function `func()` iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are the same.
   - It initializes `same` to count the length of consecutive segments and `minn` to store the minimum length found.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `num` and `same` as it encounters different elements.
   - After the loop, `minn` is checked to determine if any segment was found, and the result is printed accordingly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive segments is correct.
   - The condition to check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements is also correctly implemented.
   - The handling of the case where no such segment exists (i.e., printing `-1`) is appropriate.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the entire array is identical (`minn` remains `inf`), correctly printing `-1`.
   - The code correctly identifies and prints the minimum number of elements to remove for arrays that are not entirely identical.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function `func()` correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
