### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observation**: For an array to be beautiful, there must be at least one position `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. This means that adjacent pairs of elements must be equal at some points in the array.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided function `func()` iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where elements are the same.
   - It initializes `same` to count the length of consecutive segments and `minn` to store the minimum length found.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `num` and `same` as it encounters different elements.
   - After the loop, `minn` is checked to determine if any segment was found, and the result is printed accordingly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive segments is correct.
   - However, the function does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The function simply finds the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The function would correctly identify the minimum length of consecutive segments as 1, but removing just one element (e.g., the second element) would make the array non-beautiful. The function should instead calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break all such segments.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the entire array is identical (`minn` remains `inf`), correctly printing `-1`.
   - However, the code does not handle the case where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements than the minimum length of consecutive segments found.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function `func()` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. It only finds the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number, which does not guarantee the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
