Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element with its adjacent equal element.

2. **Key Insight**: To stop an array from being beautiful, we need to ensure that no two adjacent elements are equal after removals. The minimum number of removals needed corresponds to the minimum length of any segment of consecutive identical elements in the array.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - It initializes `same` to count the current segment of identical elements and `num` to track the current element.
   - `minn` keeps track of the minimum length of any segment of identical elements found.
   - After processing the entire array, `minn` is set to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` remains infinity (`inf`), it means there were no segments of identical elements, and thus, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the output is `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the array consists entirely of unique elements (no segments of identical elements).
   - The code correctly identifies the minimum segment length and outputs `-1` when necessary.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the code matches the problem requirements.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately.
   - The output is correct based on the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
