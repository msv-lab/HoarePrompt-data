Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by removing elements such that no two adjacent elements are equal.
3. The provided code attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the array. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
4. The logic in the code only checks for consecutive segments of the same number and finds the minimum length of such segments. However, this does not guarantee that the array will become non-beautiful after removing the minimum number of elements.
5. The code does not handle the actual removal of elements to achieve the goal of making the array non-beautiful. Instead, it incorrectly outputs the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number, which does not solve the problem as stated.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
