#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). The value of n for each test case satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^5, and each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the number of operations required for each test case to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median. Each element in `test_cases` is processed individually, and the operations count for each is appended to `results`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the number of operations required for each test case to ensure that all elements in the subarray starting from the median index are greater than the current median.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples containing the length of an array and the array itself. For each test case, it sorts the array, identifies the median, and then performs operations to ensure all elements from the median index onwards are greater than the median. It counts the number of such operations needed for each test case and returns a list of these counts.
