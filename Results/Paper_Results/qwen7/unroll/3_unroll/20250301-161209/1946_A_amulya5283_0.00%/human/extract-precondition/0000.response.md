Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (the array a). The value of n for each test case satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^5, and each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
