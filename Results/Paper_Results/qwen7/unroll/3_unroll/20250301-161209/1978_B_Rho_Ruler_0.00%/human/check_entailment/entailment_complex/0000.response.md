Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The goal is to maximize the profit from selling buns under a specific pricing scheme.
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)) to sell the first \( k \) buns at a modified price and the rest at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total profit for a given \( k \) and checks if it is within the allowed limit \( n \times \max(a, b) \).

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is used to find the maximum \( k \) such that the profit is still within the allowed limit.
   - The function `func_1` is called with different values of \( k \) to check the condition \( ans \le n \times \max(a, b) \).

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly calculates the total profit as \( ans = k \times b + (n - k) \times a \).
   - The function then checks if this profit is less than or equal to \( n \times \max(a, b) \), which ensures that the profit does not exceed the maximum possible profit.

5. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is implemented correctly to find the maximum \( k \) that satisfies the condition.
   - The loop continues until `low > high`, and the optimal \( k \) is stored in `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the optimal \( k \) found by the binary search, which corresponds to the maximum profit.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
