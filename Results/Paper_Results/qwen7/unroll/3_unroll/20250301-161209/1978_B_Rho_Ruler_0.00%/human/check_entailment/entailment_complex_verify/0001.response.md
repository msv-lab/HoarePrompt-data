### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` (number of buns sold at a modified price).
   - The modified price of the \(i\)-th bun (for \(1 \leq i \leq k\)) is \(b - i + 1\) coins.
   - The remaining \(n - k\) buns are sold at the usual price \(a\) coins each.

2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - The provided code uses binary search to find the optimal `k`.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total profit for a given `k`.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly with `low` starting at 0 and `high` starting at `n`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`, it means the current `mid` value is feasible, so we update `ans` to `mid` and move the lower bound `low` up to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we move the upper bound `high` down to `mid - 1`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - It sums the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.
   - The condition `return ans <= n * max(a, b)` ensures that the total profit does not exceed the maximum possible profit, which is `n * max(a, b)`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The binary search approach handles edge cases like `k = 0` and `k = n` correctly.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the profit calculation is accurate.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the binary search and the function `func_1`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly calculating the profit for a given `k`. The condition `return ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not appropriate because it checks if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct way to determine if the profit is maximized.

Instead, the function should directly return the calculated profit without comparing it to `n * max(a, b)`. The binary search should then use this profit value to decide whether to move the bounds.

### Corrected Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans
```

### Corrected Binary Search Logic:
```python
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    current_profit = func_1(mid, a, b, n)
    if current_profit > func_1(low, a, b, n):
        ans = mid
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1
```

With these corrections, the binary search will correctly find the maximum profit.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was incorrect because the function `func_1` and the binary search logic were flawed. The corrected function and logic ensure that the program finds the maximum profit correctly.

### Final:
**False**
