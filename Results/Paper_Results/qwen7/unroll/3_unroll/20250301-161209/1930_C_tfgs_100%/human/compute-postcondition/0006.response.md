Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `counter`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. `cur` is updated to 0.
