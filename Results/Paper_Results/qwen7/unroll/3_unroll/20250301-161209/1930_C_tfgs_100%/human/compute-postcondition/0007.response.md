Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where each element was originally increased by `i + 1` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each unique element in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The line `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a`. Since the original elements in `a` were each increased by `i + 1` for all `i` in the range of `n`, the new list `a` now contains unique integers. The `counter` object, which previously counted the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, now counts the frequency of each unique element in the new list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
