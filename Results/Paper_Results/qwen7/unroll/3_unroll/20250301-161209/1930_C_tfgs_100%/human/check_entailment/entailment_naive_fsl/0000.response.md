Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements in the array `a` are the same. According to the problem description, the set `S` should only contain unique elements. However, the program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of elements in `a`, and then adds these elements to `S` without ensuring uniqueness. This means that if there are duplicate elements in `a`, they will be added to `S` multiple times, violating the requirement that `S` is not a multiset.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 1
```
The program will output:
```
2 1 
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2 
```
because `S` should only contain the unique element `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that elements are added to `S` only once, even if they appear multiple times in `a`. One way to achieve this is by converting `a` to a set before performing the operations.
