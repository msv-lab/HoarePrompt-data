You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between any divisor \( i \) of \( x \) and \( x // i \) where \( n \) is less than or equal to either \( i \) or \( x // i \). The function then prints this maximum value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Defining Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.
   
2. **Defining the Function:**
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not actually used in the main loop.
   - This function is supposed to calculate the maximum balance of the problemset.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Balance:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program calculates the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all integers from 1 to the square root of `x` (`isqrt(x)`).
   - For each integer `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` with `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` with `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not called anywhere in the main loop. Instead, the logic is directly placed inside the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called for each test case.

2. **Logic for Calculating Maximum Balance:**
   - The logic to find the maximum balance is correct. It correctly checks all possible divisors of `x` and ensures that the number of sub-problems `n` is feasible.
   - The logic to update `ans` with the maximum balance is also correct.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The result is printed correctly after calculating the maximum balance for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error due to the unused function `func_1()`. However, the actual logic for calculating the maximum balance is correct. To fix the program, we need to call `func_1()` within the main loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from math import isqrt

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the unused function. However, the core logic for calculating the maximum balance is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
