Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem constraints and requirements. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Sub-problem Difficulties**: The code checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`, but it does not ensure that the sum of `n` sub-problems equals `x`. It should distribute the value of `x` among `n` sub-problems such that their sum is `x`.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The logic for calculating the GCD of the difficulties is not implemented correctly. The solution should find the maximum possible GCD that can be achieved by distributing `x` into `n` parts.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the sub-problems' difficulties are distributed in such a way that their sum is `x` and the GCD of these difficulties is maximized. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if i <= n:
                diff = x // i
                if diff * n == x:
                    ans = max(ans, diff)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected solution ensures that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x` and calculates the maximum possible GCD for the given constraints.
