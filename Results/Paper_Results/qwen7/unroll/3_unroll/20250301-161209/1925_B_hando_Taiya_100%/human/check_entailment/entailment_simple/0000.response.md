Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
3. The function `func_1()` is defined to find the maximum balance of the problemset.
4. Inside `func_1()`, the program finds all divisors of `x` and checks if `n` is less than or equal to these divisors or their corresponding complementary divisors (`x // i`).
5. It updates `ans` with the maximum value found during this process.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps taken, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example. The program correctly calculates the maximum balance by considering all possible ways to split `x` into `n` sub-problems and finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties.

Correctness: **True**
