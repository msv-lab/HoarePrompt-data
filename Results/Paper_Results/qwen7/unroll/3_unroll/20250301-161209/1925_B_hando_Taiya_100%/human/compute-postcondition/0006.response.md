Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8), and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ x). For each test case, it processes these integers and returns a result based on their values.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `x`, and `n`. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters as arguments but uses them within its logic to determine the output for each test case.
