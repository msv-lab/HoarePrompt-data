Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` where all values are lists. This does not change the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `edges`, or `empty`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `nodes` is created and set up as described.
