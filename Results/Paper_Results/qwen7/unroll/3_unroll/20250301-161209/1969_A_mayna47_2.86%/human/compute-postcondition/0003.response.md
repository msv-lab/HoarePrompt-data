Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0 except the first element which is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is 2**.
