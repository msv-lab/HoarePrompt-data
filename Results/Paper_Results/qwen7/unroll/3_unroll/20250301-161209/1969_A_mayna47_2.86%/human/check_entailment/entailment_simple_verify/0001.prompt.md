You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:

for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):

                return
            
        #State: v is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, and no 2 printed.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, and if `n` equals 2, then the first element of `v` is set to the input integer and no 2 is printed; otherwise, no changes are made to `v` and no 2 is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the array `p` representing the best friends.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
   - The variable `v` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` and set to `[0]`, followed by mapping the input values to this list.
   - This step is unnecessary and incorrect. The list `v` should only be of length `n` and should directly map the input values without the initial `[0]`.

4. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The special case for `n == 2` is handled correctly, printing `2` as the result.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The logic to check if at least two friends will come to the party is flawed.
     - The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` checks if the friend `i` and their best friend's best friend's best friend is `i`. This does not necessarily mean that `i` and their best friend will both receive invitations.
     - The logic to print `2` when the condition is met is incorrect. It should check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and then print `2`.
     - If no such pair is found, the logic incorrectly prints `3` without checking if sending invitations to any two friends would suffice.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends
    for i in range(n):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        # If no such pair is found, check if sending invitations to any two friends works
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if v[i] == j and v[j] == i:
                    print(2)
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            print(3)
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the main condition. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
