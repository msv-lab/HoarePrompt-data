Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop with `range(t)`, but the function definition initializes `v` with an extra zero at the beginning, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem constraints.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of invitations needed. This condition checks if the friend and their best friend's best friend are the same, which is not always the case for ensuring at least 2 friends come to the party.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, especially when `n == 2`. For `n == 2`, the correct answer should be 2, but the current implementation prints 2 only if the condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` is met, which might not always be true.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Create a mapping from friend to their best friend
    best_friends = {i: v[i-1] for i in range(1, n+1)}

    # Find cycles in the friendship graph
    visited = set()
    cycle_length = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i not in visited:
            current = i
            while current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                current = best_friends[current]
                cycle_length += 1

            # If a cycle is found, we need at most 2 invitations for each cycle
            if cycle_length >= 2:
                print(cycle_length)
                break

    # If no cycle is found, we need to invite all friends
    if cycle_length < 2:
        print(n)

```

This corrected program handles all the necessary logic to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
