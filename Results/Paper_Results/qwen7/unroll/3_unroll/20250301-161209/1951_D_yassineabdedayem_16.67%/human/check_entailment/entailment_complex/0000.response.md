Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by iterating through the steps required to determine if Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels using at most 60 stalls. The program checks if it's possible to achieve the desired outcome by repeatedly subtracting multiples of \( k \) from \( n \) and recording the necessary stall prices. If the conditions are met, it prints "YES" along with the number of stalls and the corresponding prices; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading \( n \) and \( k \).
2. **Logic Implementation**: The while loop correctly simulates Alice's greedy approach of buying as many jewels as possible from each stall until either \( n \) becomes less than \( k \) or the maximum number of stalls (60) is reached.
3. **Output Generation**: The program generates the correct output format, printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the appropriate details when applicable.
4. **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the constraints effectively, ensuring that no more than 60 stalls are used and that the prices are within the specified range.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
