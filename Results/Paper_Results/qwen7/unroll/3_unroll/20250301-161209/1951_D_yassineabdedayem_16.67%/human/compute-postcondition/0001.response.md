State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is not relevant as it is a throwaway variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the throwaway variable `_`.
- The throwaway variable `_` is used to iterate over the range of `t`, but its initial value is not relevant since it is incremented within the loop.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000.
