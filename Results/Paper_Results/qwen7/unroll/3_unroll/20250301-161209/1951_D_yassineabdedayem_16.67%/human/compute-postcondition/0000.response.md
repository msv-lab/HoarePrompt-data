Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. The other conditions and variables (n and k) are not affected by this code snippet.
