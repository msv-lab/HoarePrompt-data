Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The program then converts the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format by mapping the hours appropriately:
   - Hours from 00 to 11 remain the same with 'AM'.
   - Hours from 12 to 23 are adjusted to 01 to 11 with 'PM'.
4. The minutes remain unchanged as they are already in the correct format.
5. The program prints the converted time in the required format "h1 : m AM/PM".

Given the logic and the mappings used in the program, it correctly handles all possible inputs within the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440 and valid times in 24-hour format). There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause the program to produce incorrect outputs based on the provided problem description and example.

Correctness: **True**
