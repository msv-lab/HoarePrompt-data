Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
- The logic in the program is flawed because it uses a series of `if` statements to manually convert each possible hour from 00 to 23 to its 12-hour equivalent. This approach is inefficient and error-prone, especially since it doesn't handle the conversion in a more general way.
- A more efficient and correct approach would be to use arithmetic operations to determine whether the time is in the AM or PM period and then adjust the hour accordingly.
- However, the execution summary indicates that the program does indeed process the times correctly and outputs them in the required format. The specific implementation details do not affect the correctness of the output as long as the logic is correct.

Given the execution summary, the program appears to work correctly based on the provided examples and the problem description. Therefore, despite the inefficient and redundant code, the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
