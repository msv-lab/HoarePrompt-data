Reasoning:

1. The provided function `func()` attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
3. For each test case, it splits the input string `hh:mm` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
4. The function then uses a series of `elif` statements to convert the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determine whether it is AM or PM.
5. However, there are several issues with this approach:
   - The code is repetitive and can be simplified using a more efficient method.
   - The logic for converting hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format and determining AM/PM can be done in a more concise way.
   - There is no need for so many `elif` statements since the conversion can be done with simple arithmetic operations.
6. A more efficient and correct way to implement this would be to use the modulo operation to convert the hour and directly set the AM/PM based on the hour value.

Given these issues, the provided solution is incorrect due to its inefficiency and potential for errors.

Correctness: **False**
