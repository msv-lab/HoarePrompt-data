Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
   - The variable `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop will execute for each input provided by `int(input())`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but the loop itself requires an input to determine how many times it should run.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state before the loop must include the condition that there is at least one input available to read.
   - The variables `t` and `s` are not directly involved in the loop control, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the condition that ensures there is at least one input available to read.

**Final Answer**:
State: **There must be at least one input available to read**
