Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The output consists of either "2" printed multiple times or "3" printed n times, depending on the input provided within the loop.

In each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop checks if any element in the list `l` satisfies the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If such an element is found, it prints "2" and breaks out of the inner loop. If no such element is found after the inner loop completes, it prints "3". This process repeats for each of the `n` iterations of the outer loop.
