Precondition: **This is an interactive problem involving a secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \). You can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After finding a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, you must print "! i j".**
