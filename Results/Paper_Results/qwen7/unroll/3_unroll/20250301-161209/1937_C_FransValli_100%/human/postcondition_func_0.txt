The function interacts with a secret permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) by making up to 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements. It identifies a pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) where the bitwise XOR \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized and prints the indices "! i j".
