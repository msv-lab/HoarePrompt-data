### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Initial Strategy Analysis**:
   - The provided solution starts by setting `maxi` to 0 and then iteratively checks if swapping `maxi` with another index `i` increases the result of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\) compared to \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi}) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `maxi` holds the index with the highest value of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\).

3. **Finding Potential Candidates**:
   - After determining the best candidate for `maxi`, the code then finds potential candidates for the second index by checking if \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) < (p_{maxi} \mid p_j)\) for all \(i \neq j\).
   - It stores these candidates in the list `arr`.

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - The code then compares the potential candidates in `arr` to find the one that gives the maximum XOR value with `maxi`.
   - It prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the result.

5. **Query Count**:
   - The initial loop to find `maxi` uses \(n-1\) queries.
   - The loop to find potential candidates in `arr` uses approximately \(n-1\) queries.
   - The final comparison loop uses up to \(n-2\) queries.
   - Total queries: \( (n-1) + (n-1) + (n-2) = 3n - 4 \), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the permutation might be trivial (e.g., `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`).

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic and the approach used in the code:

- **Incorrect Initial Strategy**: The initial strategy to set `maxi` to 0 and then update it based on \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\) compared to \((p_i \mid p_i)\) is flawed. This only ensures that `maxi` holds the index with the highest value of \((p_{maxi} \mid p_{maxi})\), but it does not necessarily maximize the XOR value \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

- **Potential Candidates Selection**: The selection of potential candidates in the list `arr` is based on the condition \((p_{maxi} \mid p_i) < (p_{maxi} \mid p_j)\), which is not sufficient to ensure that the final pair \((maxi, mini)\) maximizes the XOR value.

- **Final Comparison**: The final comparison loop to find the best candidate from `arr` is also problematic. It only considers the potential candidates and does not ensure that the final pair \((maxi, mini)\) maximizes the XOR value.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not guarantee that the final pair \((maxi, mini)\) will have the maximum XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
