Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on a given array. It first identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array and stores these segments along with their starting and ending indices. Then, for each query, it determines the segment that overlaps with the query range [l, r] and prints specific information based on the values within that segment. If no valid segment is found, it prints -1 -1. The function does not modify the original array or any other input parameters.**
