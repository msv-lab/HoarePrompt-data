Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a consists of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range [1, 10^6], q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and nums is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and the original value of `N` remain unchanged.
