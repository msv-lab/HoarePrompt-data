Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array and stores them along with their starting and ending indices.
2. For each query, the function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment that overlaps with the query range `[l, r]`.
3. Based on the position of the segment relative to the query range, the function correctly prints the indices of two different elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.
4. The function does not modify the original array or any other input parameters, adhering to the problem constraints.
5. The logic for handling the segments and queries is consistent with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
