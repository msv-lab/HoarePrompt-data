Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array and stores them.
2. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment that overlaps with the query range `[l, r]`.
3. Based on the position of the start and end of the identified segment relative to the query range, it correctly prints the required indices or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.
4. The logic handles edge cases where the segment's start or end is outside the query range appropriately.
5. The program does not modify the original array or any other input parameters, adhering to the problem constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to implement the solution correctly according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
