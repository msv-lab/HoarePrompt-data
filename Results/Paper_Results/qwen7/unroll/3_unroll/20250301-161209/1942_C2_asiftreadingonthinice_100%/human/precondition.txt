t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
