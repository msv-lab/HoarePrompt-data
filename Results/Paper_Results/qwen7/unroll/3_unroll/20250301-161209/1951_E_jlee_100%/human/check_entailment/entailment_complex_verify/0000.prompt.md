You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each input string `string` of length `n`, the program checks various conditions to determine if the string can be split into two parts such that each part is a palindrome or if the entire string is a palindrome with one character differing from the others. Based on these conditions, the program prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional details if applicable. After processing all `t` strings, the final state of `t` remains unchanged, but the printed outputs (either 'YES' or 'NO' with possible additional details) reflect the results of each string's evaluation.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two palindromic parts or if the entire string is a palindrome with at most one character differing from the others. If such a condition is met, it prints 'YES' along with additional details; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but produces output based on the conditions checked for each string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify partitions for strings where no single non-palindromic substring can be found. 

Consider the input string `aaaa`. According to the problem description, the output should be:

```
NO
```

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output:

```
YES
1
aaaa
```

This is because the program checks if the first character is different from the last character, which is not a sufficient condition for determining whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. The program should instead check if there is any substring that is not a palindrome, and if not, conclude that the entire string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it properly identifies cases where no valid partition exists, such as when all characters in the string are the same.
