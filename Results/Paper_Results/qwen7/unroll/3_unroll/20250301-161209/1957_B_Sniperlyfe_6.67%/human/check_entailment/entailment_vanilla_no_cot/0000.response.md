Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error. Specifically, the approach used in `func_1` does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The line `nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` sets each element to the largest possible value with the bit length of `k`. This does not necessarily lead to maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Adjustment**: The line `k -= nums[i]` subtracts the current value from `k`, but this does not ensure that the remaining values will collectively maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

3. **Final Adjustment**: The line `nums[-1] += k` adds the remaining value to the last element, which might not be optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to distribute the sum `k` among the elements in such a way that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s. One effective approach is to set most elements to 0 and use the remaining sum to create a single large number that contributes the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    # Create a list with n-1 zeros
    nums = [0] * (n - 1)
    # Set the last element to k
    nums.append(k)
    return nums
```

This approach ensures that the sum of the elements is `k` and the bitwise OR of the sequence will be `k`, which has the maximum number of 1s possible given the constraints.
