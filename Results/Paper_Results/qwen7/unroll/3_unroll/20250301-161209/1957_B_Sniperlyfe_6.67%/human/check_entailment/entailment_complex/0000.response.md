Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is designed to create a sequence of `n` integers that sum up to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - The current implementation initializes a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to `k-1`. This is incorrect because setting each element to `k-1` does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The loop then subtracts `nums[i]` from `k`, but this does not help in achieving the goal of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - Finally, the last element of `nums` is adjusted to `2*k-1` and `k` is set to 0. This also does not align with the goal of maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, we should aim to include as many numbers with high bit values as possible.
   - A better approach would be to use the highest possible value for each number until the sum constraint is met. For example, we could start with the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and continue until the sum is reached.

3. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case `6 51`, the expected output is `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]`.
   - This output correctly sums to 51 and has a bitwise OR of `(101\,111)_2` which has five 1s, maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
