Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and the last element is `2*k-1` with `k` being 0.**

Explanation: For each test case, the list `nums` is defined such that all elements except the last one are `k-1`, and the last element is `2*k-1`. After the operation, `k` is reduced to 0. Therefore, the last element of `nums` becomes `2*0-1 = -1`, and all other elements remain `0-1 = -1`. The program returns this list `nums`.
