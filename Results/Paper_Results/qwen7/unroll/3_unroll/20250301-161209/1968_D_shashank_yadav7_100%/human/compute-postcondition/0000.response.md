Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of length n; a is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
