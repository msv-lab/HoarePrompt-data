The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads in values for \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \), and an array \( a \). It then calculates two scores, `bm` and `sm`, based on the values of elements in \( a \) and their positions in \( p \), adjusted by \( k \). After iterating through the permutation, it compares `bm` and `sm` and prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on which score is higher or if they are equal.
