Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input values for each test case.
2. It properly initializes the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha, adjusting them to zero-based indices.
3. The function correctly calculates the scores for both players by considering the moves and staying in place.
4. The logic for updating the maximum scores (`bm` for Bodya and `sm` for Sasha) is correct, taking into account the remaining turns (`k`).
5. The function correctly handles the end of the game by breaking out of the loop when `k` reaches zero.
6. The comparison and output of the results ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') are done accurately based on the calculated scores.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
