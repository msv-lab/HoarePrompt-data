Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position Adjustment**: It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
3. **Score Calculation**: It calculates the initial scores for both players based on their starting positions.
4. **Game Simulation**: The program simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores accordingly. It uses a loop to simulate each turn, updating the positions based on the permutation `p` and recalculating the maximum possible scores for both players.
5. **Output Determination**: After simulating the game, it compares the final scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the structure and logic of the program, it accurately follows the rules of the game and correctly determines the winner based on the provided inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
