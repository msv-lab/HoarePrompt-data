Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \).
3. The program adjusts the starting positions \( P_B \) and \( P_S \) to be zero-indexed.
4. It initializes `bm` (Bodya's maximum score) and `sm` (Sasha's maximum score) using the initial scores at the starting positions.
5. The program then iterates up to \( k \) times, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation \( p \), and recalculating the maximum possible scores for both players.
6. Finally, it compares the maximum scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the steps and the logic implemented in the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the rules of the game and computes the scores accurately. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
