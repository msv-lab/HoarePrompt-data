Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions in a way that does not reflect the rules of the game. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The program calculates the scores by repeatedly updating `bm` and `sm` based on the maximum possible scores after each turn. However, the logic for updating these scores is flawed. The program should consider the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the new position based on the permutation, but it does not properly account for this.

2. **Incorrect Position Update**: The program updates the positions `b` and `s` using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect because the positions are 1-indexed in the input but the program uses 0-indexing. This will lead to incorrect positions being used in subsequent calculations.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- **Expected Behavior**: According to the problem description, Bodya starts at position 3 and Sasha starts at position 2. After the first turn, Bodya can stay at position 3 (scoring 5) or move to position 2 (scoring 2). Similarly, Sasha can stay at position 2 (scoring 2) or move to position 1 (scoring 7). After the second turn, they can again choose to stay or move based on their current positions.

- **Program's Incorrect Logic**: The program does not correctly simulate the choices and outcomes of each turn. It only considers the maximum possible scores without properly reflecting the actual game dynamics.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
