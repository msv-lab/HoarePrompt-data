Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and n has been assigned the value of an input integer.**

This means that `t` retains its original value (an integer between 1 and 100), and `n` is now assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which also falls within the range of 1 to 100.
