Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, n is an input integer, a is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the input string into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
