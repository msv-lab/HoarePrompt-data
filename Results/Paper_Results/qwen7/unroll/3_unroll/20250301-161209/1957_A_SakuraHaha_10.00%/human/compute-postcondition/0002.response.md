Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
