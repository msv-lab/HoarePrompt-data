To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a` divided by 4.
   
2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(ans)`

Given the initial state, `ans` is calculated as follows:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- For each unique integer in `a`, count how many times it appears.
- Sum these counts.
- Divide this sum by 4 to get `ans`.

Since the actual list `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know the formula used to calculate `ans`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 4.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a` divided by 4)**
