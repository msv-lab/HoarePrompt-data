Output State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the number of times the character 'F' was encountered at the corresponding index across all inputs; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the number of times the character 'S' was encountered at the corresponding index across all inputs; `xx` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a string input from the loop; `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`; `sb` is a list containing indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.
