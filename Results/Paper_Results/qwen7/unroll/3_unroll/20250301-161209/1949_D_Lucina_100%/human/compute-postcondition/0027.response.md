Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the number of times the character 'F' was encountered at the corresponding index across all inputs; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the number of times the character 'S' was encountered at the corresponding index across all inputs; `xx` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a string input from the loop; `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`; `sb` is a list containing indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`; after the loop executes, each string in `xx` has been modified according to the rules inside the loop, resulting in a new string `nx` which replaces the original string at each iteration, and `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and any index `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` has been appended to `sb` if the condition `len(sa) >= len(sb)` is met, otherwise `sa` is updated to contain indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.**
