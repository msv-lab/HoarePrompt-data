Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, the input integer must also satisfy this condition. After executing this line of code, the value of `n` is updated to the input integer, while the other conditions and the nature of `n` remain the same.
