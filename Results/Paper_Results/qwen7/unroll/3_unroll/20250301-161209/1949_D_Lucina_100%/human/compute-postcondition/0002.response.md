Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the existing list `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `a` is still a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros. Therefore, the output state includes the updated information about `b` and retains the original state of `n` and `a`.
