Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a grid of size n x n, where n is an integer between 2 and 24. Each cell in the grid represents a transition video between two scenarios, with characters indicating whether the video is funny (F), scary (S), undecided (.), or unknown (?). The function determines the type of transition video for each undecided cell based on the given constraints and returns the updated grid.**
