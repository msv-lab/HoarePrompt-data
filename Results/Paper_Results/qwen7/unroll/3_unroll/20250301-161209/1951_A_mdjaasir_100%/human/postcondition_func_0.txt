The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a binary string `a`. It then checks the number of '1's in the string `a`. Based on the count of '1's, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the standard output. Specifically, it prints 'YES' if there are no '1's, more than two '1's with an even count, or exactly two '1's that are not adjacent. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
