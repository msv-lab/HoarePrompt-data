Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`. According to the problem description, for a grid of size `n x n`, there are `4 * n - 2` diagonals. The program's logic does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cells to color when `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`.

For example, consider the following input:
- Test case: `7 14` (since `4 * 7 - 2 = 28 - 2 = 26`, but we are checking for `k = 14`).

The correct answer should be `6`, as shown in the provided diagram. However, the program incorrectly calculates this case. Let's break down the program's logic:

- For `k < 4 * n - 3`, the formula `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)` is used.
- For `k >= 4 * n - 3`, the formula `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` is used.

When `k == 4 * n - 2`, the program should return `6`, but instead, it returns `14` because it uses the second part of the conditional, which is `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. This results in `2 * 7 * 1 + 0 = 14`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for the case when `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`.
