You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the given conditions for each test case within the loop. For each test case, if \( k < 4n - 3 \), the output will be \((k // 2 + k \% 2)\). If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the output will be \(2n\). Additionally, if \( k = 4n - 2 \), the output will be \(2n\) as well. The specific values depend on the input values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, if \( k < 4n - 3 \), it prints \((k // 2 + k \% 2)\). If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), it prints \(2n\). Additionally, if \( k = 4n - 2 \), it also prints \(2n\). The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the calculated values for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the given function and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Function:**
   - The function reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The function uses a complex expression to compute the result:
     ```python
     (k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
     ```

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `(k // 2 + k % 2)`: This part computes the ceiling of \( k / 2 \).
   - `(k < 4 * n - 3)`: This checks if \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \).
   - `(k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( 4n - 3 \).
   - `2 * n`: This represents the number of cells needed if \( k \) is very large (i.e., \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)).
   - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This is an additional check for the exact value \( 4n - 2 \).

4. **Testing the Logic:**
   - For small values of \( k \) (less than \( 4n - 3 \)), the function should return the minimum number of cells required to cover \( k \) diagonals.
   - For \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the function should return \( 2n \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.
   - The expression correctly handles edge cases like \( k = 4n - 2 \).

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - \( 4n - 3 = 9 \), so \( k < 9 \). The function computes \( (4 // 2 + 4 % 2) * (4 < 9) + 2 * 3 * (4 >= 9) + (4 == 9) \), which simplifies to \( 2 * 1 + 0 + 0 = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
     - \( 4n - 3 = 9 \), so \( k < 9 \). The function computes \( (3 // 2 + 3 % 2) * (3 < 9) + 2 * 3 * (3 >= 9) + (3 == 9) \), which simplifies to \( 2 * 1 + 0 + 0 = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - \( 4n - 3 = 9 \), so \( k \geq 9 \). The function computes \( (10 // 2 + 10 % 2) * (10 < 9) + 2 * 3 * (10 >= 9) + (10 == 9) \), which simplifies to \( 0 + 2 * 3 * 1 + 0 = 6 \).

The function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells needed to cover the required number of diagonals.
