Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed based on the given conditions for each test case. For each test case, if \( k < 4n - 3 \), the output is \((k // 2 + k \% 2)\). If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the output is \(2n\). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the output is also \(2n\).

In mathematical terms, the output for each test case is determined as follows:
- If \( k < 4n - 3 \), the output is the parity of \( k \) (i.e., \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \)).
- If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the output is \( 2n \).
- If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the output is \( 2n \).

Output State: A list of integers where each integer is either the parity of \( k \) or \( 2n \) depending on the value of \( k \) relative to \( 4n - 3 \).
