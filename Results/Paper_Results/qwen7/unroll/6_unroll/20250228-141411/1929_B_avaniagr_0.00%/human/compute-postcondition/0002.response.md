Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the given conditions for each test case within the loop. For each test case, if \( k < 4n - 3 \), the output will be \((k // 2 + k \% 2)\). If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the output will be \(2n\). Additionally, if \( k = 4n - 2 \), the output will be \(2n\) as well. The specific values depend on the input values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.
