Output State: `lst` is a defaultdict where each key represents a node and its value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The loop iterates `x-1` times, each time adding a bidirectional edge between two nodes specified by the input. Therefore, `lst` will contain all the bidirectional edges specified in the inputs.
