Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to variables `x` and `y`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The precondition that the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer `u_1` such that 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n` is still valid.
