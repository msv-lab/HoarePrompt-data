Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid, and now `t` also holds the value of the input integer. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
