You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Note

In the first example, all subsegments are good.

In the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1 , 2 , and 3 .

- Program:
from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and two lists `a` and `b` (where `a` contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `b` contains `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive). It calculates and returns the number of rightmost subarrays of size `n-m+1` in `a` such that the minimum count of any element in both the first `m` elements of `a` (`a[:m]`) and the rest of `a` (`a[m:]`) is at least `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count occurrences of elements in both arrays after sorting them.
2. **Initialization**: 
   - `cb` is the counter for sorted `b`.
   - `ca` is the counter for the first `m` elements of sorted `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
3. **Initial Check**:
   - `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements in `a` and `b` using the intersection of counters (`ca & cb`).
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the initial segment of length `m` is good, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The loop iterates through the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), if its count in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`, it means adding this element increases the count of matching elements, so `sm` is incremented by 1.
   - The element being removed from the window (`a[r-m]`) is decremented in `ca`, and if its count in `ca` is now less than or equal to its count in `cb`, `sm` is decremented by 1.
   - If `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k` after these updates, the current segment is considered good, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
5. **Output**: The function returns `ans`, which is the total number of good subsegments.

Given the logic and implementation, the program correctly calculates the number of good subsegments for each test case.
