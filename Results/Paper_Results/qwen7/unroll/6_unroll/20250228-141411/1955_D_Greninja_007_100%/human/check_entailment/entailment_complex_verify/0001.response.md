### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This part is accurate.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cb` is the counter for the sorted `b`.
   - `ca` is the counter for the first `m` elements of sorted `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
   - This part is also accurate.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements in `a` and `b` using the intersection of counters (`ca & cb`).
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the initial segment of length `m` is good, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - This part is accurate.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The loop iterates through the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), if its count in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`, it means adding this element increases the count of matching elements, so `sm` is incremented by 1.
   - The element being removed from the window (`a[r-m]`) is decremented in `ca`, and if its count in `ca` is now less than or equal to its count in `cb`, `sm` is decremented by 1.
   - If `sm` is still greater than or equal to `k` after these updates, the current segment is considered good, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the sliding window logic. The code assumes that the count of an element in `ca` is always less than or equal to its count in `cb` when it increments `sm`, but this is not necessarily true. The correct logic should be to check if the count in `ca` is less than the count in `cb` before incrementing `sm`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns `ans`, which is the total number of good subsegments.
   - This part is accurate.

### Corrected Sliding Window Logic:
The original logic in the sliding window part is flawed because it incorrectly increments `sm` without ensuring that the count in `ca` is less than the count in `cb`. The correct logic should be:
```python
if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
    sm += 1
```
should be replaced with:
```python
if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
    sm += 1
else:
    sm -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially accurate but overlooks the critical flaw in the sliding window logic. The program will not correctly count the number of good subsegments due to this error.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flaw in the sliding window logic.
