Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` (integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and lists `a` and `b` (where `a` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive). It returns `ans`, which is the number of rightmost subarrays of size `n-m+1` in `a` such that the minimum count of any element in both `a[:m]` and `a[m:]` is at least `k`.**
