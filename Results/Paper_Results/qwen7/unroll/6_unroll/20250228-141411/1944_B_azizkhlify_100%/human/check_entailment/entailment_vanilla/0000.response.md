Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to store the selected elements.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are used to keep track of the number of elements selected for `l` and `r` and their respective XOR values.

3. **Counting Elements in `l`:**
   - The program counts how many times each element appears in the first half of the array (`a[0:n]`).
   - If an element appears twice, it prints those two elements and sets the count to zero.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If fewer than `2k` elements are selected for `l`, the program tries to select more elements from the first half where the count is 1.
   - This ensures that the total number of elements in `l` is `2k`.

5. **Printing `l`:**
   - The program prints the elements selected for `l`.

6. **Handling Remaining Elements for `r`:**
   - The program then selects corresponding elements from the second half of the array (`a[n:2n]`) to ensure the XOR values match.
   - It prints the elements selected for `r`.

7. **Ensuring Equal XOR Values:**
   - The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The logic for selecting remaining elements for `l` and `r` is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers elements with a count of 1 in the first half and doesn't ensure the total number of elements in `l` is `2k`.
   - The program should ensure that exactly `2k` elements are selected for `l` and `r` while maintaining the XOR condition.

2. **Incomplete Selection Logic:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the XOR condition cannot be satisfied with the current selection strategy. For example, if the XOR of the first half is different from the XOR of the second half, the program will fail to find a valid solution.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
