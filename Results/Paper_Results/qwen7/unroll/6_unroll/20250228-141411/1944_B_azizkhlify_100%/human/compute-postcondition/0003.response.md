Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of 2n integers (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice), along with two integers n and k (satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). It returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the instruction to only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
