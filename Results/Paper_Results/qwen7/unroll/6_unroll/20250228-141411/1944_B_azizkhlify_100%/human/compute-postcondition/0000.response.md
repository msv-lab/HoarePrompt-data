Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) can be any integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. Additionally, since the loop body is omitted, no other variables are directly affected by the loop itself, but the input value must be valid for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it falls within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
