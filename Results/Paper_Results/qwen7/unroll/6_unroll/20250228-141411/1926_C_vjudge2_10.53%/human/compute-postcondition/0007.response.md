Output State: **The list `numbers` contains `t` integers; the list `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0; the list `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0; `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. This does not affect the lists `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
