Output State: The list `numbers` contains `t` integers; the list `values` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; the list `sum_values` is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55]; `total` is 55. During the loop execution, the `print` function outputs the elements at the indices specified by the list `numbers` from the list `sum_values`.
