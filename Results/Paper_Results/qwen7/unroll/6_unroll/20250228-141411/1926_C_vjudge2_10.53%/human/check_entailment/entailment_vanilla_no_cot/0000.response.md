Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Summing Digits**: The program attempts to precompute sums for all numbers up to `max(numbers)` using a list `values`. However, it incorrectly calculates the sum of digits for each number and does not handle the replacement of each integer with the sum of its digits properly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `sum_values`**: The `sum_values` array is being used to store cumulative sums, but it is not updated correctly for numbers beyond 10. The logic for calculating the sum of digits for numbers greater than 10 is flawed.

3. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads all test cases and numbers at once, but it does not correctly process each test case independently. It should compute the sum of digits for each number in the test case separately.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += digit_sum(i)
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This solution correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` for each test case and prints the result.
