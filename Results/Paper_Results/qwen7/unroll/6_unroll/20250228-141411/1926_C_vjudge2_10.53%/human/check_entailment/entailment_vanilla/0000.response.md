Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` for each test case.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, both of size `max(numbers) + 1`.
   - It also initializes a variable `total` to store the sum of digits from 0 to 9.

3. **Filling `values` and `sum_values`:**
   - For digits 0 to 9, it directly sets `values[i]` to `i` and updates `total` and `sum_values[i]`.
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, it calculates the sum of digits using string manipulation:
     - Converts the number to a string.
     - Extracts the last digit and the remaining part of the number.
     - Recursively calculates the sum of digits using previously computed values.
     - Updates `values[i]` and `sum_values[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, it prints the value from `sum_values[n]`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum of Digits:**
   - The program attempts to use recursion for calculating the sum of digits, but it does not handle the recursive calculation correctly. The logic inside the loop for numbers 10 to `n` is flawed because it should be computing the sum of digits directly without unnecessary complexity.

2. **Inefficient Use of Lists:**
   - The program precomputes sums for all numbers up to `max(numbers)`, which is inefficient for large values of `n`. This approach can lead to unnecessary computations and memory usage.

3. **Recursive Logic Flaw:**
   - The recursive logic to calculate the sum of digits is not implemented correctly. The current implementation does not properly handle the sum of digits for multi-digit numbers.

### Correct Approach:

A more efficient and straightforward approach would be to directly compute the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `n` without precomputing sums for all numbers.

### Revised Program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = sum(sum_of_digits(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program has several issues and does not correctly solve the problem as intended. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
