Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: The list `numbers` contains `t` integers; the list `values` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]; the list `sum_values` is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55]; `total` is 55.

During the loop execution, the values from the `values` list are printed based on the indices specified in the `numbers` list, but the lists and the total variable remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). It then constructs two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, based on these integers and a predefined sequence. Finally, it prints the values from the `sum_values` list corresponding to the integers read in the test cases. The function does not return any value but modifies and uses global lists `values` and `sum_values` and an integer `total` during its execution.
