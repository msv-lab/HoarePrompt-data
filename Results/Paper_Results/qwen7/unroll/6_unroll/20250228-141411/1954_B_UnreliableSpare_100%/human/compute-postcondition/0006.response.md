Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False, `ans` is Decimal('Infinity').**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, or `flag`. The value of `flag` remains `False` as it was set by the loop in the previous code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their respective values, plus the new variable `ans` initialized to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
