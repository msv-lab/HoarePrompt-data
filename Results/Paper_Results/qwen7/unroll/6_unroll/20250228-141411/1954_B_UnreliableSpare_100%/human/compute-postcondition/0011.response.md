Output State: **`val` is the last element in `arr`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`ans`) and the new value of `cnt`. The variables `val` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `ans` is updated to reflect the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in `arr` up to this point.
