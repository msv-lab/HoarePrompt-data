### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is beautiful (`flag` is `True`), it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
     - It initializes `ans` to infinity.
     - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive occurrences of the same value.
     - Whenever a different value is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.
     - Finally, it prints the result stored in `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Checking if the array is beautiful**:
     - The logic for checking if the array is beautiful is correct. The loop correctly identifies if there are any two adjacent elements that are different.
   - **Finding the minimum number of removals**:
     - The approach to find the minimum number of removals to break the beauty condition is also correct. The program correctly counts the consecutive occurrences of the same value and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - **Handling edge cases**:
     - The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately. For instance, in the first test case, the array `[2, 2, 2]` is already beautiful, so it prints `-1`. In the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is not beautiful, and removing one element makes it non-beautiful, so it prints `1`.

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points. The final state of `flag` is indeed `False` when there is at least one pair of consecutive elements that are different.
   - The logic for updating `ans` and the final output are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final: True**
