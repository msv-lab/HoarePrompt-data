You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the given array a is beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop checks if the current element in `arr` is different from the previous one. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, after the loop completes, `flag` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are different, otherwise, it remains `True`. However, since the problem statement specifies that `flag` is initially `True`, and the loop will set it to `False` as soon as it finds a difference, the final state of `flag` will be `False`.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `val` is the last element in `arr`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in `arr`.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of val in arr)
    #State: Postcondition: `val` is the last element in `arr`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, and `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`. Whether `flag` is true or false, `ans` remains the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), another integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns whether the given list a is beautiful for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
