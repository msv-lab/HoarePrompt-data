Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as required.
2. It initializes the `flag` variable to `True` and checks if the array is already non-beautiful by finding any pair of consecutive elements that are different. If such a pair is found, `flag` is set to `False`.
3. The program then calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array, which helps in determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
4. If the array is already non-beautiful (`flag` is `False`), it prints `-1`.
5. Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum number of elements to remove.
6. The logic for calculating the minimum number of consecutive occurrences seems to be flawed because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same value.

However, the core logic of checking if the array is beautiful and determining the minimum number of elements to remove is conceptually correct but implemented incorrectly.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The current implementation only counts the lengths of consecutive segments of the same value and does not consider the necessary operations to break the beauty condition.
