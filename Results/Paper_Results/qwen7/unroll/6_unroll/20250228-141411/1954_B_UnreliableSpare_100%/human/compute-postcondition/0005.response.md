Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `flag` is False.

Explanation: The loop checks if the current element in `arr` is different from the previous one. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, after the loop completes, `flag` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are different, otherwise, it remains `True`. However, since the problem statement specifies that `flag` is initially `True`, and the loop will set it to `False` as soon as it finds a difference, the final state of `flag` will be `False`.
