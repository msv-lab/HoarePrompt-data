### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Calls `func_1()` and returns the integer value.
   - `func_3()`: Calls `func_1()` and splits the resulting string into integers, returning a list of these integers.
   - `func_4()`: This function processes the input for each test case. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. For each throw, it updates `ans` based on the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or `?`).

2. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the function extracts the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a new set `temp` and updates it based on whether `c` is `'0'`, `'1'`, or `'?'`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` with `temp`.

3. **Final Adjustments**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` (since `0` modulo `n` is `0`).
   - The size of `ans` is printed, followed by the sorted elements of `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements, including the case where the direction is unknown (`'?'`).
   - The modulo operation ensures that the player number wraps around correctly within the circle of players.
   - The final adjustment of replacing `0` with `n` is correct, as `0` modulo `n` is `0`, but `n` itself should also be considered as a valid position.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
