### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` functions.
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by adding `r` to the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by subtracting `r` from the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - The program uses a set to store all possible positions of the ball after each throw. This ensures that all possible positions are considered.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if the position `0` is in the set `ans`. If so, it replaces `0` with `n` to handle the circular nature of the players.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and their sorted positions.

### Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
  - State: The program reads a line from standard input, which could be a string like "6 3 2" or "2 ?".

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - Converts the string read by `func_1` into an integer.
  - State: The program reads an integer value, such as `6` from "6 3 2".

- **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
  - Converts the string read by `func_1` into a list of integers.
  - State: The program reads a list of integers, such as `[6, 3, 2]` from "6 3 2".

- **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
  - Initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
  - Iterates over each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the direction `c` and distance `r`.
  - Handles the edge case where `0` is replaced with `n` if present.
  - Prints the number of unique players and their sorted positions.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`.

- **Processing Throws:**
  - The program correctly handles both clockwise (`'0'`) and counterclockwise (`'1'`) directions.
  - The use of a set ensures that all possible positions are considered without duplicates.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The check for `0` in `ans` and replacing it with `n` is correct to handle the circular nature of the players.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the number of unique players and their sorted positions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. It handles all aspects of the problem statement accurately.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
