t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of four lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, x separated by spaces such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The next m lines each contain two values: an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?') representing the distance and the direction of the i-th throw, respectively.
