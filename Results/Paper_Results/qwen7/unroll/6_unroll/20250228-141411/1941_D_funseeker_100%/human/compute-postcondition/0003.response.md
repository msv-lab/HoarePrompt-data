Output State: `ans` is a set of integers, each resulting from either adding or subtracting `r` (where `r` is an integer derived from `func_1().split()[0]` converted to an integer) to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`. The operations are performed based on the value of `c` ('0', '1', or '?') for each iteration of the inner loop. The set `ans` starts with a single element `x` and undergoes these transformations for `m` iterations, where `m` is the return value of `func_3()`.
