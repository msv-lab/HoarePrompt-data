Based on the initial state described, let's break down the situation:

- `ans` is a set of integers.
- Each integer in `ans` is the result of adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`.
- If `0` was initially in `ans`, it has been removed and `n` has been added to `ans`.
- If `0` was not initially in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.

The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the set `ans`.

Given the transformations and conditions applied to `ans`, the length of `ans` will remain the same because the operations performed (adding or subtracting `r` modulo `n`) do not change the number of unique elements in the set. The only change mentioned is that if `0` was initially in `ans`, it gets removed and `n` is added, but this does not affect the count of elements in the set.

Therefore, the output will be the length of the set `ans` after applying the described transformations.

Output: **len(ans)**
