Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the player `x`, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the return value of `func_3()`, and `x` is the return value of `func_3()`**.

This means that the set `ans` is now initialized with the player `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` have been updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`.
