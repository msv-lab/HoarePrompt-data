Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers, each integer being the result of adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`, except 0 which has been removed.**

Explanation: The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the integer `0` from the set `ans`. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged. The operations that determine the elements in `ans` (adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element modulo `n`) and the fact that `0` was originally present in the set are preserved.
