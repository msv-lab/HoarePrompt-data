You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the diagonally opposite corners and prints the smaller distance. The function outputs a series of numbers, one for each test case, representing the minimum distance calculated for each set of input coordinates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly calculates the area of the square.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(a, b)`, `(c, d)`, `(e, f)`, and `(g, h)`.

2. **Calculating Distances:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` using the formula `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the squared distance between the points `(c, d)` and `(g, h)` using the formula `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`.

3. **Determining the Side Length:**
   - The program assumes that the smaller of the two distances calculated (`n` and `x`) corresponds to the side length of the square.
   - It prints the smaller value.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Assumption:**
   - The program assumes that the smaller of the two distances is always the side length of the square. This is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to check all possible pairs of points to identify the side length of the square.

2. **No Verification of Square Properties:**
   - The program does not verify that the points form a square. It only checks the distances between pairs of points, which might not guarantee that they form a square.

3. **No Handling of All Possible Configurations:**
   - The program does not handle all possible configurations of the square's corners. It only considers two pairs of points and assumes the smaller distance is the side length, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Counter-Example:

Consider the following input:
```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```

The correct area of the square should be `4`. However, the program might incorrectly calculate the distance between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 1)` as `4` and between `(1, 3)` and `(3, 3)` as `4`, leading it to print `4` instead of `4`.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly determine the area of the square for all possible configurations of the corner points.
