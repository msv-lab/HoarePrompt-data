### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) plus the number of universals (`universals`) can form complete groups of 3.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to form at least one group of 3.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`, which calculates the number of tents required.

2. **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - This function calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The function `func_1` correctly handles the logic for forming groups of 3 with extroverts and universals.
- The function `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` to account for introverts and handle the case where it's impossible to form groups of 3.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_1`:

- The condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is incorrect. It should be checking if the remaining extroverts after forming as many groups of 3 as possible can be paired with universals to form additional groups of 3.
- Specifically, the correct condition should be `extroverts // 3 + (extroverts % 3 > 0) + universals < 3`.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # Calculate the number of full groups of 3 that can be formed
    full_groups = extroverts // 3
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
    
    # Check if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form additional groups of 3
    if full_groups + (remaining_extroverts > 0) + universals < 3:
        return None
    return full_groups + ceil((remaining_extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
```

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `2` because 2 extroverts and 3 universals can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `2` because 4 extroverts and 1 universal can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `2` because 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `1` because 1 extrovert and 1 universal can form 1 group of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 1 (from func_1) = 2`.

5. **Test Case 5**: `1 3 2`
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `2` because 3 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.

6. **Test Case 6**: `19 7 18`
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `9` because 7 extroverts and 18 universals can form 9 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `19 (introverts) + 9 (from func_1) = 28`.

### Conclusion:

The original implementation had a logical error in `func_1` that led to incorrect results for some test cases. The corrected implementation ensures that the logic for forming groups of 3 is correct.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
