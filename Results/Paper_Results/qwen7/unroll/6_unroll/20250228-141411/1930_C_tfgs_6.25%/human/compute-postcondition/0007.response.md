Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` which now contains unique elements from the original list `a` after removing duplicates; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5; `a` is a list of integers where each element a[i] is increased by (i + 1) for all i in the range of n.**

Explanation: The line `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a`, making it contain only unique elements. The values of `counter`, `t`, `n`, and the transformation rule for `a` remain unchanged.
