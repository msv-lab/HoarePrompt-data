Based on the initial state provided:

- `counter` is a Counter object with updated counts for each integer in `a`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is an empty list.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(*ans)
```

Here, `*ans` is used to unpack the list `ans` and pass its elements as separate arguments to the `print` function. Since `ans` is explicitly stated to be an empty list, there are no elements to print.

Output: **[]**
