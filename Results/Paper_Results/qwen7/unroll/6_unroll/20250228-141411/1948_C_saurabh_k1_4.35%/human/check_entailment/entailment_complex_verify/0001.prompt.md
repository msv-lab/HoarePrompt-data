You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the output will be 'Yes' if the second last character of the second input string is not '<', otherwise 'No'; there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2 * 10^5 and \( n \) is even), and two strings of length \( n \) made up of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is not '<'. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function ensures it processes up to 10^4 test cases, and the total \( n \) across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` (number of columns).
   - It then reads two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Problem Understanding

- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and must reach `(2, n)`.
- The robot can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- The robot then moves according to the arrow in the current cell.
- The goal is to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Condition**:
   - The condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` only checks the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row.
   - This condition does not account for the entire path the robot needs to take to reach `(2, n)`.
   - The robot can move in various ways, and the arrow in the second-to-last column might not be the determining factor.

2. **Lack of Path Tracing**:
   - The program does not trace the path the robot takes to determine if it can reach `(2, n)`.
   - It only checks one specific condition, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle other scenarios where the robot can still reach `(2, n)` despite the arrow in the second-to-last column being `'< '`.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)` based on the provided conditions and path tracing logic.
