Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and n is even) representing the length of strings, and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>' representing arrows. The function checks the input strings for each test case and returns different outputs based on specific conditions, ensuring the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
