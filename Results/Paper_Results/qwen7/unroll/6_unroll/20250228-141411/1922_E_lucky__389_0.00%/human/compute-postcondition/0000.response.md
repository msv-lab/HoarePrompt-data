Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input is only assigned to `x`. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 1000, while `x` is now an integer input by the user.
