State: **`t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two objects: `_` (an underscore, typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is not relevant for determining the loop's execution, as it is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition.
4. The initial state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's ability to execute, so it does not need to be adjusted.
5. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the final state is: **`t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list**.
