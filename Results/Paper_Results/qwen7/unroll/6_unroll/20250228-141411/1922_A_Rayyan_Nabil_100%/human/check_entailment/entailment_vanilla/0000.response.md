### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not. A template can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters, where:
   - Lowercase letters in the template must exactly match the corresponding letters in `a` and `b`.
   - Uppercase letters in the template must not match the corresponding lowercase letters in `c`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not equal `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic only checks if `a` and `b` can potentially match the template, but it does not ensure that `c` will not match the template.
   - It fails to consider the requirement that `c` should not match the template, which means `c[i]` should not match the lowercase version of the template character at position `i`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` itself is incorrect because it does not check if `c` does not match the template.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to create a template dynamically based on the characters of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]` and `a[i] != c[i]` (or `b[i] != c[i]`), we can set the template character to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, we cannot determine a valid template character without further information, so we return 'NO'.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution. They only check if `a` and `b` can match a template but do not ensure that `c` does not match it.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly check the conditions for the template to ensure that `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.
