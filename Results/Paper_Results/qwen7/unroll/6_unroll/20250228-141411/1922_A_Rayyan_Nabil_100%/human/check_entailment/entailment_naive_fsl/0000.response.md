Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The function `func_1` only checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` do not match `c`. However, this is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template `t`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- String `a` is "aa".
- String `b` is "bb".
- String `c` is "ab".

In this case, the function `func_1` would return "YES" because at the first position, `a[0]` ('a') does not match `c[0]` ('a'), and `b[0]` ('b') does not match `c[0]` ('a'). However, there is no valid template `t` that satisfies the conditions for both `a` and `b` but fails for `c`. A valid template `t` could be "AA" or "BB", which would make both `a` and `b` match but `c` not match.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
