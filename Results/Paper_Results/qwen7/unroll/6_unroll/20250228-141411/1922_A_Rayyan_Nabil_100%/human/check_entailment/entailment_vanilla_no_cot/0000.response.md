Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution only checks if for each position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If the character in `t` (template) is lowercase, then both `a[i]` and `b[i]` should match the lowercase version of `t[i]`.
- If the character in `t` is uppercase, then both `a[i]` and `b[i]` should not match the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

Additionally, `c[i]` should not match the template `t` for at least one position.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    # Check if there exists a template that matches a and b but not c
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i].islower() and b[i].islower()) and a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i].lower():
            continue
        elif (a[i].isupper() and b[i].isupper()) and a[i].lower() == b[i].lower() and a[i].lower() == c[i].lower():
            continue
        else:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Function call to process input
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the template logic is properly checked for each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
