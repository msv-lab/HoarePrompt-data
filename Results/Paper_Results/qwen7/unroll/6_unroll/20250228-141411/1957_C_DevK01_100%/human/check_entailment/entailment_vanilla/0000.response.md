Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, where each move consists of coordinates `(r, c)`.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program iterates through the `k` moves.
   - For each move, it checks if the row and column are different (`a != b`).
     - If they are different, it reduces the effective size of the board by 2 (since both a white and a black rook are placed, reducing the available positions by 2).
     - If they are the same, it reduces the effective size of the board by 1 (since only one rook is placed).

3. **Calculating Final Configurations:**
   - After processing all moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` seems to be incorrect. The formula used in the loop does not accurately represent the problem of counting non-attacking rook placements.
   - Specifically, the formula `dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]` is not correct for this problem.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `7 + 10 ** 9` is incorrect. The problem specifies to use `10^9 + 7` as the modulo value.

3. **Logic for Reducing Board Size:**
   - The logic to reduce the board size by 2 or 1 based on whether the row and column are the same is correct, but the implementation of this logic is fine.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the `func_1` function, the overall program is not correct. The function `func_1` does not solve the problem as intended.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: **False**
