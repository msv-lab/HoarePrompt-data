### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis further:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other. This is a classic combinatorial problem known as counting derangements or non-attacking rook placements.
   - The current implementation uses a dynamic programming approach, but the recurrence relation used is incorrect. The formula `dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]` does not correctly model the problem of placing non-attacking rooks.
   - The correct recurrence relation for this problem is more complex and involves binomial coefficients and factorials, which are not captured in the current implementation.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the modulo operation should be `10^9 + 7` instead of `7 + 10 ** 9`.

3. **Logic for Reducing Board Size:**
   - The logic to reduce the board size by 2 or 1 based on whether the row and column are the same is correct. This part of the program is implemented correctly.

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - Given the issues in the `func_1` function, the overall program is not correct. The function `func_1` does not solve the problem as intended.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:

To correctly solve the problem, the function `func_1` should implement the following logic:
- Initialize the base cases: `dp[0] = 1` (one way to place 0 rooks) and `dp[1] = 1` (one way to place 1 rook).
- For each `i` from 2 to `n`, calculate the number of ways to place `i` rooks using the recurrence relation:
  \[
  dp[i] = (i - 1) \times (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])
  \]
- The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Corrected `func_1` Implementation:

```python
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp.append((i - 1) * (dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]) % (10**9 + 7))
    return dp[-1]
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the `func_1` function, the overall program is not correct. The function `func_1` does not solve the problem as intended.

**Final: False**
