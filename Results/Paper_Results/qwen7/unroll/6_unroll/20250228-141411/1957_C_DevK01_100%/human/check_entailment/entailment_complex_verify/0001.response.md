### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` more carefully.

#### Problem Restatement:
We need to count the number of valid configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) board after \( k \) moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer. The function `func_1` should correctly compute the number of valid configurations.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The provided function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board such that no two rooks attack each other. The formula used in the loop is:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

This formula is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a board. Let's break it down:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - \( dp[0] = 1 \): There is exactly one way to place zero rooks.
   - \( dp[1] = 1 \): There is exactly one way to place one rook.

2. **Recursive Formula:**
   - For \( i \geq 2 \), the number of ways to place \( i \) rooks is given by:
     \[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \]
     This formula accounts for:
     - Placing a rook in the first row and column (which leaves \( i-1 \) rooks to place on the remaining \( (i-1) \times (i-1) \) board).
     - Placing a rook in any of the remaining \( i-1 \) rows and columns, which leaves \( i-2 \) rooks to place on the remaining \( (i-2) \times (i-2) \) board.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is correctly set to \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Correctness of `func_1`:
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the dynamic programming solution for counting non-attacking rook placements. The logic and the formula are sound.

#### Main Program Analysis:
- The main program correctly processes the input and updates the effective size of the board based on the moves.
- The function call `func_1(n)` is correctly placed after processing the moves.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct in terms of its logic and implementation.

### Conclusion:
**Final: True**

The program is correct because:
1. The function `func_1` correctly computes the number of valid configurations using dynamic programming.
2. The main program correctly processes the input and updates the board size based on the moves.
3. The modulo operation is correctly set to \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate, and the program is correct.
