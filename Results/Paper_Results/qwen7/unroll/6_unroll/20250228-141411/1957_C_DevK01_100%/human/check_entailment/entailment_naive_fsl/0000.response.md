Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the program subtracts the number of rows and columns occupied by rooks directly without considering the combinatorial nature of the problem. The function `func_1` is intended to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board, but it does not account for the mirrored placements and the constraints of the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 1
  1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

However, the program's output is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining rows and columns after accounting for the initial moves and their mirrors. The program's current logic does not handle this correctly.

Here is a brief outline of the correct approach:
1. Subtract the number of rows and columns affected by the initial moves and their mirrors.
2. Calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining rows and columns using combinatorial methods.

The given program does not implement this logic correctly, hence the output is incorrect for certain inputs.
