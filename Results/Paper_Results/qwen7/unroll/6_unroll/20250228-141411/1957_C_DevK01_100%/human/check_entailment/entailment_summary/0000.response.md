Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of moves. The moves are mirrored between the player and the computer, and the goal is to compute the number of unique configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of previous moves \( k \).
   - It then iterates through the previous moves and adjusts \( n \) based on whether the move was mirrored (reducing \( n \) by 2) or not (reducing \( n \) by 1).
   - Finally, it calls the function `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible configurations and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of configurations using dynamic programming.
   - It initializes a list `dp` with the base values `[1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( n \), updating the `dp` list according to the formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`.
   - The function returns the last element of the `dp` list, which represents the number of configurations.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for adjusting \( n \) based on the moves is correct.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for calculating the number of configurations.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
