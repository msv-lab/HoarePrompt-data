Output State: `dp` is a list of length `n`, where each element is calculated based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`, with the first two elements initialized as `[1, 1]` and the list being updated by appending the new value and then removing the first element in each iteration.
