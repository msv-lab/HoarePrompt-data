Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum final score. Specifically, the program incorrectly removes elements from the list `lst` during the loop, which leads to incorrect comparisons and scores. For instance, consider the input:

```
1
2
2 4
```

The correct approach would be to always pair the smallest numbers first to maximize the score. However, the current implementation does not ensure this. It only removes the first two elements from the list, which may not always yield the optimal score. For the given input, the correct score should be 2 (by pairing 2 and 2), but the program might not handle this correctly due to its flawed logic.
