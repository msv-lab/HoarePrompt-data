### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - The program splits the input string into a list of strings and converts them to integers.
   - However, the logic inside the loop to process the list of integers is flawed. Specifically:
     - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect because it only checks if the list has at least two elements but does not handle the general case where the list might have more than two elements.
     - The indices `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. These indices should be adjusted to remove the first two elements from the list, but they are not dynamically adjusting as the list size changes.
     - The loop should continue until all elements are processed, but the current implementation breaks out of the loop prematurely when only two elements remain.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem optimally, we should sort the list of integers and then pair the smallest available integers together to maximize the score.
   - By sorting the list and iterating through it in pairs, we ensure that we always pick the smallest available integers, which maximizes the score.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the calculated score for each test case to the list `ans_f` and prints each score on a new line.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic used to process the list of integers. A correct solution would involve sorting the list and then pairing the smallest available integers.

### Correctness:
**False**
