Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the maximum score by always choosing the two smallest numbers available at each step. However, the implementation has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Pair Selection**: The program tries to remove elements from `lst` in a way that does not guarantee selecting the smallest pair at each step. Specifically, it removes elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which is incorrect because it skips elements in between.

2. **Early Termination**: The program breaks out of the loop early when only two elements are left, which is not necessary and might lead to incorrect results if the last two elements are not the smallest ones.

3. **Efficient Pair Selection**: The optimal solution should involve always picking the smallest available pair, which can be achieved more efficiently using a sorted list or a min-heap.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the maximum score for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
