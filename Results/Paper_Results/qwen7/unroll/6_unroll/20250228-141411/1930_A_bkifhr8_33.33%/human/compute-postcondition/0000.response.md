Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and `t` is now an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, after executing the code, `t` retains its constraint but is now specifically set to the input integer provided by the user. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
