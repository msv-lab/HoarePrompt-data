Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers printed in each iteration of the loop. Each integer represents the final value of `ans` after processing each set of inputs provided by the loop, with `ans` being calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` and the available `k`. The value of `t` is reduced by one after each iteration, starting from the number of iterations specified by the first input.**

To provide a concrete example, if the initial state was given as follows:

- `ans_list = [5, 3, 8, 2]`
- `k = 1`

After executing the loop, the output state would be:

Output State: **[4, 2, 7, 1]**
