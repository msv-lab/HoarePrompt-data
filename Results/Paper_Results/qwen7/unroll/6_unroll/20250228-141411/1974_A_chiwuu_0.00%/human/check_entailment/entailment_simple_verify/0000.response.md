### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the logic used to determine the minimum number of screens needed.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - `n` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `a` and `b` are parsed from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Initial Grids Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `t = b * 2`: This step calculates the total number of 2x2 icons multiplied by 2, which should give the total number of cells they occupy.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t = t // 5`: This step divides the total number of cells by 5 (since each grid has 15 cells, and 15 // 5 = 3), but this is incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual number of grids needed.
   - Otherwise, `t = t // 5 + 1`: This step correctly accounts for the number of grids needed if `t` is not divisible by 5.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This step calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged: This condition checks if there are enough remaining cells to place all 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, `t2 = a - t1`: This step calculates the number of additional cells needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t = t + t2 // 15`: This step adds the number of additional grids needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1`: This step adds the number of additional grids needed, rounding up if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `t` is printed, representing the minimum number of screens needed.

### Issues with the Current Logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Initial Grids:**
   - The logic `t = b * 2` and `t = t // 5` is incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual number of grids needed. Instead, it should directly calculate the number of grids needed for the 2x2 icons.

2. **Handling Remaining Cells:**
   - The logic for handling the remaining cells and adding additional grids is overly complex and incorrect. It doesn't properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Calculate the number of grids needed for the 2x2 icons directly.
2. Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many additional grids are needed to place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        grids_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 4) // 15  # Number of grids needed for 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * grids_for_2x2 - b * 4  # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        if remaining_cells < a:
            additional_grids = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Additional grids needed for 1x1 icons
            total_grids = grids_for_2x2 + additional_grids
        else:
            total_grids = grids_for_2x2
        print(total_grids)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
