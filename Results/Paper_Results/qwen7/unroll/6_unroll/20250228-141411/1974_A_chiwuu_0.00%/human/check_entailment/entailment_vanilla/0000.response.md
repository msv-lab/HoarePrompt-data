Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, we need to divide the total number of 2x2 icons by 5 (since each screen has 15 cells) and round up.
   - This is done using `t = b * 2` to get the total number of cells needed for 2x2 icons, and then `t // 5` to get the number of full screens, with `t // 5 + 1` if there is any remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - After placing all 2x2 icons, the remaining space on the screens is calculated as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - This gives the number of 1x1 cells left after placing all 2x2 icons.

4. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons (`a`), then no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by dividing the remaining 1x1 icons by 15 (since each screen has 15 cells) and rounding up.

5. **Output:**
   - The final number of screens needed is printed.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space:**
   - The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect because it assumes that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, but this does not account for the layout constraints where 2x2 icons can overlap or be placed in a way that doesn't fully utilize the 4 cells.

2. **Rounding Up Logic:**
   - The logic for rounding up the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons is flawed. It should ensure that the remaining space is correctly accounted for and that the number of screens is always rounded up correctly.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the layout constraints and ensure that the placement of 2x2 icons does not exceed the available space. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(b * 2 / 5)
        
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 5 * screens_for_2x2 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((a + remaining_space - 1) / 15)
        
        print(screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors in calculating the remaining space and the number of screens needed. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
