Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on their sizes. However, there are several issues with the logic and calculations in the program that lead to incorrect results.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which is not correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 2.
   - The condition `if t % 5 == 0` should check if the total number of 4-cell blocks (which is `b * 4`) fits perfectly into the 5x3 grid, but the logic to determine the number of full screens and remaining cells is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Cells**:
   - After calculating the number of full screens needed for the 2x2 icons, the program incorrectly calculates the remaining space and tries to fit the 1x1 icons into this space. This approach is overly complex and does not correctly account for the layout constraints.

3. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect because `t` should represent the number of screens, and `t * 15` does not make sense in this context.
   - The logic for determining how many additional screens are needed based on the remaining 1x1 icons (`a - t1`) is flawed and does not correctly account for the layout constraints.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
