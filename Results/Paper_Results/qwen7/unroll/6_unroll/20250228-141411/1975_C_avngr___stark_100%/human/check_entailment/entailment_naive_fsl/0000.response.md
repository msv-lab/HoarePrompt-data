Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible value that the array can be made uniform through the given operations. Specifically, the program only considers the median of subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to handle all cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will output `3` because it only considers the medians of subarrays of length 3. However, the correct approach is to consider the median of any subarray that can be chosen. In this case, choosing the entire array `(l=1, r=5)` results in the array becoming `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, which has a maximum value of `4`.

The program fails to account for the possibility of choosing larger subarrays, which could potentially yield a higher median value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
