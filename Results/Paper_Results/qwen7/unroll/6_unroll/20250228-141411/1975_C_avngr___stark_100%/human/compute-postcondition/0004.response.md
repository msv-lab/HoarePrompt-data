Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, the function returns information about the input data, such as the value of n and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, while ensuring that t (the number of test cases) is within the range of 1 to 500, and n is within the range of 2 to 10^5.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return type (e.g., a list of results for each test case) are not specified in the given information, only the constraints and structure of the input data.
