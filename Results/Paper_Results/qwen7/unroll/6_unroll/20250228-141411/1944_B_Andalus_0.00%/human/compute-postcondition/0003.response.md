Output State: The output will consist of pairs of elements from the left part of the sorted list followed by single elements, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed in each line. If there are repeated elements in the left part, only the first occurrence is considered for pairing. Elements in the right part are also processed similarly but after the left part. Each line will contain up to `k` elements, with repeated elements from the left part paired together if possible, and single elements from both parts appended at the end if necessary.
