You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, an array a of length 2n is given, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        lft = lst[:n]
        
        rgt = lst[n:]

        sz = 0
        
        for elem in ldb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            print(elem, end=' ')
            sz += 1
        
        print()
        
        sz = 0
        
        for elem in rdb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of pairs of elements from the left part of the sorted list followed by single elements, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed in each line. If there are repeated elements in the left part, only the first occurrence is considered for pairing. Elements in the right part are also processed similarly but after the left part. Each line will contain up to `k` elements, with repeated elements from the left part paired together if possible, and single elements from both parts appended at the end if necessary.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, k, and an array a of length 2n. For each test case, it checks if n and k satisfy the conditions 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, and if each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array a. If all conditions are met, it performs some operation (not specified here) and returns the result accordingly. If any condition fails, it handles the error appropriately.
