Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding two arrays `l` and `r` each of length `2k` such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`. The arrays `l` and `r` should be subsets of the first half and the second half of the given array `a`, respectively.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`.
   - It splits `a` into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).
   - It initializes empty lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` to store duplicate elements from `lft`, duplicate elements from `rgt`, and singular elements from `lft`, respectively.
   - It sorts both halves to facilitate finding duplicates.
   - It processes the `ldb` list to add pairs of duplicate elements from `lft` to `sng` until `sz` (the current size of the solution) reaches `k`.
   - It processes the `rdb` list similarly to add pairs of duplicate elements from `rgt` to `sng` until `sz` reaches `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed arrays `l` and `r`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the sorting and processing of elements correctly.
   - It ensures that the resulting arrays `l` and `r` have the required properties (length `2k` and matching bitwise XOR values).
   - The logic for handling duplicates and singular elements is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the required format of two lines per test case, each containing `2k` integers.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
