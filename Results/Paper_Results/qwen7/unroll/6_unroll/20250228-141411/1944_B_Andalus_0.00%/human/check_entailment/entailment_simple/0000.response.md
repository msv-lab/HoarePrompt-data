Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `T`, `n`, `k`, and the array `a`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the left (`lft`) and right (`rgt`) halves of the array separately. This is a good approach to simplify the process of finding subsets with equal XOR values.

3. **Finding Unique and Repeated Elements**:
   - In the left half (`lft`), it identifies repeated elements (`ldb`) and unique elements (`sng`).
   - In the right half (`rgt`), it identifies repeated elements (`rdb`).

4. **Constructing Subsets `l` and `r`**:
   - The program attempts to construct the subsets `l` and `r` by pairing repeated elements from the left and right halves and using unique elements if needed.
   - It ensures that the total number of elements in each subset does not exceed `2k`.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the subsets `l` and `r` in the required format, ensuring that the total number of elements in each subset does not exceed `2k`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is small and there might not be enough repeated elements to form the subsets. It uses unique elements to complete the subsets if necessary.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program should work correctly for the given problem statement. The program ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` have equal XOR values and that the total number of elements in each subset does not exceed `2k`.

Correctness: **True**
