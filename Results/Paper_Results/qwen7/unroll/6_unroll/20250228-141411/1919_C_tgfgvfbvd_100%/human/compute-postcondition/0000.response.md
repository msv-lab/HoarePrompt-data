Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input value (which we will call `num_cases`) must be within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case will involve reading an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected.
