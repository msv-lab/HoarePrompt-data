Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The function returns a result based on the given test cases, where each n and list of integers are within specified constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. It processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.
