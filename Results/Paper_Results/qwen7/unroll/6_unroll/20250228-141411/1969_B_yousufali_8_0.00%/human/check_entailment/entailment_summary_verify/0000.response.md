### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, where the cost of each operation is the length of the shifted substring. The goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function reads a list of integers from the input, which is incorrect because the problem specifies a binary string. The function then incorrectly calculates the cost based on the positions of zeros and ones, without considering cyclic shifts.
   - **func_2**: This function processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each. However, since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary states that `func_2` processes a specified number of test cases, takes a binary string as input, sorts the string using cyclic shifts, and does not return any value. This summary is misleading because the function does not actually sort the string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it attempts to count something unrelated to the problem.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. The functions do not handle the input as a binary string and do not account for the necessary cyclic shifts to sort the string.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the final evaluation should reflect this.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the input as a binary string and does not implement the necessary logic to sort the string using cyclic shifts.
