Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a common placeholder for an unused variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it is an integer input from the user.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` being assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` will always be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0.

5. **Conclusion**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `t`, and it must be greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
