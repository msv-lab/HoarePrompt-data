Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always selects the two largest numbers from the list and sums them, but it does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two non-empty piles to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 3 3 1
```
The program would output `6` because it selects the two largest numbers `3` and `3` and sums them. However, the correct solution would be to put the books with `3` pages and `1` page in one pile and the book with `2` pages in another pile, resulting in a total of `3 + 3 = 6` pages for the first pile and `2` pages for the second pile, summing to `6` pages in total.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and find the maximum sum of the highest numbers in each pile. The current implementation only considers the first two largest numbers, which may not always yield the maximum possible sum.
