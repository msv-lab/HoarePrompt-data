Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is now an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 5000, and `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
