Output: **n - 2 * neg (where n is the input integer and neg is the number of '-' characters in the string s)**

Explanation:
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

The expression `n - 2 * neg` calculates the result based on the number of '-' characters in the string `s`. If `n` is not equal to `neg`, it prints `n - 2 * neg`. If `n` is equal to `neg`, it prints `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n - 2 * neg` where `n` is the input integer and `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
