### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array \(a\) derived from the string \(s\). The penalty is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by the length of the segment.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the string \(s\).
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in \(s\) and stores this count in `neg`.
   - The output is determined by the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it outputs `n`.

3. **Penalty Calculation Insight**:
   - If `n` (length of the array) is not equal to `neg` (number of `-1` elements), the optimal strategy is to split the array into segments of alternating `+1` and `-1` values, which results in a sum of zero for each segment, thus the penalty for each segment is zero.
   - If `n` equals `neg`, it means the array consists entirely of `-1` values, and the optimal strategy is to keep the entire array as one segment, resulting in a penalty of `n`.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - `n - 2 * neg`: This formula correctly calculates the minimum penalty. If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the penalty is zero for each segment, so the total penalty is `n - 2 * neg`. If `n` equals `neg`, the penalty is `n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The formula handles all edge cases correctly:
     - If `n` is even and `neg` is half of `n`, the array is split optimally into segments with zero sum.
     - If `n` is odd and `neg` is half of `n`, the array is split into one segment with a non-zero sum, but the formula still works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case based on the provided problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
