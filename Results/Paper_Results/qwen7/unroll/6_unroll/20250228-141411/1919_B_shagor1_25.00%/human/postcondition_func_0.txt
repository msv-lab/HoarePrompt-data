The function processes a single test case consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. It counts the number of '-' characters in the string and calculates the result based on the formula `n - 2 * neg`, where `neg` is the count of '-' characters. If `n` equals `neg`, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns `n - 2 * neg`.
