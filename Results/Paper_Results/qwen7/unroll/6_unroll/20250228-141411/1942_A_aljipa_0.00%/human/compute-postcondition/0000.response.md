Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), this condition is preserved. The only change is that `t` now holds the value of the input provided by the user.
