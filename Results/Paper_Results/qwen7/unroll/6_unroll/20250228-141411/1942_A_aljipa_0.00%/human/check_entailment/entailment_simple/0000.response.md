Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each.
3. The logic for determining the result (`res`) is as follows:
   - If `k == n`, it creates an array of `n` ones.
   - If `k == 1`, it creates a range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

However, this logic does not always produce the correct results according to the problem statement. Specifically:
- When `k == n`, the array `[1, 1, ..., 1]` is indeed sorted in all its cyclic shifts, so this part is correct.
- When `k == 1`, the requirement is to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The range `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` does not necessarily meet this requirement because cyclic shifts like `[1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, 0]` are not sorted. Therefore, this part is incorrect.
- When `k != n` and `k != 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1`, which is correct.

Given these points, the program fails to correctly handle the case where `k == 1`. A correct solution would need to ensure that the array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift when `k == 1`.

Correctness: **False**
