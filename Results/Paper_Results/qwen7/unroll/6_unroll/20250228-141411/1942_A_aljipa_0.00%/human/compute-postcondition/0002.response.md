Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing either 1 repeated n times, or a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1, or -1. Specifically, for each line, if the input value of k is equal to n, the line will contain n '1's. If k is equal to 1, the line will contain a sequence of numbers from 0 to n-1. Otherwise, the line will contain '-1'. The number of such lines will be equal to the input integer t, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
