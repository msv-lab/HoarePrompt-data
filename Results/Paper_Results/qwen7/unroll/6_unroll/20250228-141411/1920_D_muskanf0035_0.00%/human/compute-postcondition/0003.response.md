Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer representing the number of operations), q (an integer representing the number of queries), operations (a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers (b, x)), and queries (a list of integers k_i). It performs a series of operations on an array a based on the operations list and then returns the elements at the specified positions given in the queries list.**

This means the function processes a series of operations on an array and then retrieves specific elements from the modified array based on the query positions.
