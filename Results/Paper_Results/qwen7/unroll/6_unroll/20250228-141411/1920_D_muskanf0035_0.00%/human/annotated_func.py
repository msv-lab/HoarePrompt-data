#State of the program right berfore the function call: operations is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value). op_type is either 1 or 2, and value is an integer for op_type 1 and an integer for op_type 2 indicating the number of copies to append. queries is a list of integers k_i representing the positions Jayden wants to know the elements at.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `result` list at all. The only operation it performs is on the `array` list. However, the loop's body extends the `array` with its own contents in each iteration, which effectively doubles the length of the `array` in every step. Since the `array` starts as an empty list, and the loop does not add any new elements (only copies existing ones), the `array` will still be an empty list after the loop completes. The `result` list remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list named result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (`op_type`, `value`), and `queries` is a list of integers `k_i`. The function processes the `operations` to potentially modify an `array`, but since the operations do not add any new elements to the `array`, it remains empty. The function then iterates over the `queries` and appends the same element (which is always the first element due to the empty `array`) to the `result` list for each query. Finally, the function returns an empty list named `result`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of operations, q is an integer representing the number of queries, operations is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers (b, x), and queries is a list of integers k_i. The operations list describes the sequence of operations performed on the array a, and the queries list contains the positions k_i for which the k-th element of the final array a needs to be determined.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After executing the loop `t` times, for each iteration, we read `n` operations and `q` queries, process them using `func_1`, and print the results. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each line containing the results of `func_1` for the respective iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: the number of operations (n), the number of queries (q), a list of operations (each operation being a list of two integers b and x), and a list of query positions (queries). It processes these operations on an array and returns the values at the specified query positions. The function runs this process t times, where t is the number of inputs provided via the initial loop.
