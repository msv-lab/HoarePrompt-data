### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness, using the annotated code and the original assessment as a basis.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `array` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `result` is initialized as an empty list to store the final answers.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - The function iterates through each operation in `operations`.
   - If the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, it appends the value to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, it extends `array` by appending `value` copies of the current `array`.

3. **Handling Queries**:
   - The function iterates through each query in `queries`.
   - For each query, it calculates the index using `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the periodic nature of the array due to the repeated extensions.
   - The calculated index is appended to `result`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries respectively.
   - It reads the operations and queries as specified.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations:
     - Appending a single value (type 1).
     - Extending the array by repeating itself multiple times (type 2).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles queries by considering the periodic nature of the array.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the query index wraps around the current length of the array, which is correct given the way the array grows.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function should handle large values of `k` correctly by wrapping around the array length.
   - The function should handle the case where the array length exceeds the maximum possible value of `k`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of extending the array. When the function encounters an operation of type 2, it extends the array by appending `value` copies of the current `array`. This means the array can grow exponentially, and the modulo operation might not correctly reflect the actual position in the array after such extensions.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code

- **Initial State**: `array` is empty.
- **First Operation (Type 1)**: Append `value` to `array`.
- **Second Operation (Type 2)**: Extend `array` by appending `value` copies of the current `array`.
- **Third Operation (Type 1)**: Append another value to the extended array.
- **Fourth Operation (Type 2)**: Extend the array again by appending more copies.

This process continues, and the array can grow very large, especially when there are multiple type 2 operations. The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` might not correctly reflect the actual position in the array because the array can have many repeated sections due to the type 2 operations.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue

Consider the following example:
- Operations: `[1, 1], [2, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]`
- Queries: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20]`

1. After `[1, 1]`: `array = [1]`
2. After `[2, 2]`: `array = [1, 1, 1, 1]`
3. After `[1, 3]`: `array = [1, 1, 1, 1, 3]`
4. After `[2, 3]`: `array = [1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]`

Now, for query `k = 14`:
- The modulo operation `(14 - 1) % 15 = 13`
- The 14th element in the array is actually the 1st element (1), not the 14th element.

### Conclusion

The function does not correctly handle the periodic nature of the array after multiple type 2 operations. The modulo operation might not correctly reflect the actual position in the array, leading to incorrect results for some queries.

**Final: False**
