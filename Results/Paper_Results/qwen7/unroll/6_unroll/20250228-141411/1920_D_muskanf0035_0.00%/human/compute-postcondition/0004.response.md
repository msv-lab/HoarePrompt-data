Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: the number of operations (n), the number of queries (q), a list of operations (each operation being a list of two integers b and x), and a list of query positions (queries). It processes these operations on an array and returns the values at the specified query positions. The function runs this process t times, where t is the number of inputs provided via the initial loop.**
