You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: operations is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value). op_type is either 1 or 2, and value is an integer for op_type 1 and an integer for op_type 2 indicating the number of copies to append. queries is a list of integers k_i representing the positions Jayden wants to know the elements at.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `result` list at all. The only operation it performs is on the `array` list. However, the loop's body extends the `array` with its own contents in each iteration, which effectively doubles the length of the `array` in every step. Since the `array` starts as an empty list, and the loop does not add any new elements (only copies existing ones), the `array` will still be an empty list after the loop completes. The `result` list remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list named result
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, operations, and queries. n is an integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of integers k_i. The function returns an empty list named result.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty list named result


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
