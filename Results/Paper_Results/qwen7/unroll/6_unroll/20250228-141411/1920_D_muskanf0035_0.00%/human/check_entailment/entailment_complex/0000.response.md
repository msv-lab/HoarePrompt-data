Reasoning:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function processes a list of operations and a list of queries.
  - It initializes an empty `array` and an empty `result`.
  - For each operation, if the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
  - If the operation type is 2, it appends the entire `array` multiple times (x times).
  - After processing all operations, it iterates through the queries and appends the corresponding element from the `array` to the `result`.
  - The function returns the `result`.

  The key issue here is that the function does not correctly handle the operation of appending the array multiple times. Instead of extending the array with its own contents, it should extend it with the current state of the array. This means the array should grow according to the operations, and the queries should be answered based on the final state of the array.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the results.
  - The logic for reading input and calling `func_1` is correct.

Given the problem description and the example, the function `func_1` needs to correctly handle the operations and produce the correct array state before answering the queries. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the operations, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the operation of appending the array multiple times, resulting in an empty array and incorrect query results.
