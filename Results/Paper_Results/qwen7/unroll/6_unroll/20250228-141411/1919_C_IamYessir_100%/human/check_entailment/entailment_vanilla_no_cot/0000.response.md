Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in how it splits the array into subsequences `a` and `b`. Specifically, the conditions used to decide whether to add an element to `a` or `b` are flawed. This results in incorrect splitting, leading to an incorrect penalty calculation.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize two lists to store the subsequences
        a, b = [], []
        
        # Iterate through the array and decide which subsequence to append to
        for num in lit:
            if len(a) == 0 or num <= a[-1]:
                a.append(num)
            else:
                b.append(num)
        
        # Calculate penalties for both subsequences
        def calculate_penalty(subseq):
            return sum(1 for i in range(1, len(subseq)) if subseq[i] > subseq[i-1])
        
        penalty_a = calculate_penalty(a)
        penalty_b = calculate_penalty(b)
        
        # Output the total penalty
        print(penalty_a + penalty_b)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that elements are added to the appropriate subsequence based on their relative order, ensuring the optimal split.
