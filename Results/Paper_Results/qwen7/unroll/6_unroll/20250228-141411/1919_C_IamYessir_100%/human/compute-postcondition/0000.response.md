Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python to indicate that the value of the loop variable is not needed.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the expression `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. Since the input is expected to be a positive integer (as per the problem statement), the loop will continue to execute as long as the user provides valid input.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. The key here is to ensure that the input provided by the user is a valid positive integer. Given the constraints, the input should be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that the input provided is a valid positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Since the loop itself does not depend on any other variables or lists, and the only condition for the loop to execute is the valid input, we don't need to adjust any other states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
