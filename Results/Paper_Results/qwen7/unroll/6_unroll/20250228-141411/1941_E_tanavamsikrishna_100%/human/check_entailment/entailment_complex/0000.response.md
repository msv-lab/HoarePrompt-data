### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river's depths and ensures that the cost of installing supports meets the specified conditions.
   - The function initializes the first element of the row to 1 and increments each of the next `d-1` elements by 2.
   - It then uses a min-heap to ensure that the cost of installing supports is minimized while maintaining the required distance between supports.
   - The function correctly updates the row list and returns the last element, which represents the total cost for that row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the entire grid of river depths and calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - It iterates through each row, computes the cost for that row using `func_1`, and stores these costs in a list called `costs`.
   - It then calculates the sum of every consecutive sub-list of length `k` within the `costs` list.
   - Finally, it finds and prints the minimum value among these sums, which represents the optimal total cost for building the bridges.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input constraints and processes each row and the entire grid as required.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the cost of installing supports is minimized while adhering to the distance constraint.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly aggregates the costs for building the bridges on consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided test cases.
