### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function starts by setting `row[0] = 1` and incrementing elements from index 1 to `d-1` by 2.
   - This part ensures that the first and second elements are set to 1 and 3 respectively, which is a starting point for the heap.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with elements from the first `d` elements of `row`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each element from index `d` to the end of the row, the function pops the smallest element from the heap and checks if its index is within the required distance (`i - (d + 2)`).
   - If the condition is met, the element is reinserted into the heap twice after incrementing it by 1.
   - This process ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

4. **Heap Operations**:
   - The heap operations are used to maintain the minimum cost for placing supports, ensuring that the distance constraint is respected.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the dimensions and the grid of depths from the input.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` to calculate the cost of placing supports.
   - These costs are stored in the `costs` list.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - It then calculates the sum of every consecutive sub-list of length `k` within the `costs` list.
   - The minimum of these sums is printed as the result.

#### Correctness Verification:
1. **Heap Logic**:
   - The heap logic in `func_1` is designed to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`. This is achieved by maintaining the minimum cost for placing supports and reinserting the updated values back into the heap.

2. **Distance Constraint**:
   - The while loop ensures that only elements within the required distance are considered for reinsertion, thus maintaining the distance constraint.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the row might have varying depths and the distance constraint needs to be strictly followed. The heap ensures that the minimum cost is always considered for placing supports.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to place supports according to the problem constraints. The original assessment incorrectly identified issues with the heap usage and support placement, but upon closer inspection, the implementation seems to address these concerns appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges according to the given problem constraints.
