Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a list `row` representing the depths of the river cells in a single row and an integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between supports.
   - It initializes the first element of `row` to 1 and increments the next `d-1` elements by 2.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest values in the first `d` elements of `row`. For each subsequent element in `row` (starting from index `d`), it pops the smallest element from the heap (if its index is within the required distance) and increments the current element by 1 plus the popped value. Then, it reinserts the updated value back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the modified `row`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and the depths of the river cells for each row.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to calculate the cost of installing supports.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of the `k` rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all such sets.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the logic in both functions appears to correctly implement the requirements. The `func_1` function ensures that the cost of installing supports meets the specified conditions, and `func_2` correctly aggregates these costs for different sets of rows.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
