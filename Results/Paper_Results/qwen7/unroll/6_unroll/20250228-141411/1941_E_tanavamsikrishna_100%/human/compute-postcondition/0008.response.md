Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m). It also accepts a list called rows, which contains n lists, each of length m, consisting of positive integers. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input according to the given constraints and the structure of the rows list.**
