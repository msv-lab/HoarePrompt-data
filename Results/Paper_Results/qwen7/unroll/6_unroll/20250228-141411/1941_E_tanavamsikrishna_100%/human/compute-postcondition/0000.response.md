Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces; rows is still a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. It does not modify the `rows` list, which remains unchanged from its initial state. The constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are preserved, and the structure of the `rows` list remains as described in the initial state.
