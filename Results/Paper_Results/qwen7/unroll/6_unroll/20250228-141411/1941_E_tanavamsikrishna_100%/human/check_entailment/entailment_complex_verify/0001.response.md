### Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution step-by-step to ensure the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**: The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1 and incrementing the next `d-1` elements by 2. This ensures that the first and the first few elements are set to values that will be used as a baseline for the min-heap.
2. **Min-Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row. This heap keeps track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d`.
3. **Processing Remaining Elements**: For each element from index `d` onwards, the function pops the smallest element from the heap and checks if its index is within the required distance constraint (`i - (d + 2)`). If it is, the cost of placing a support at the current index is updated by adding the popped element's value plus 1. The popped element is then reinserted into the heap twice to maintain the heap property.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the minimum cost of placing supports in the row under the given constraints.

The logic in `func_1` appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself from standard input.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the resulting costs in the `costs` list.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible combination of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
4. **Result Output**: It prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

The logic in `func_2` also appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Overall Program Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input constraints and processes each row and combination of rows as required.
- The use of a min-heap in `func_1` efficiently finds the minimum cost of placing supports, ensuring that the distance constraint is respected.
- The overall approach in `func_2` to calculate the total cost and find the minimum cost for `k` consecutive rows is sound.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
