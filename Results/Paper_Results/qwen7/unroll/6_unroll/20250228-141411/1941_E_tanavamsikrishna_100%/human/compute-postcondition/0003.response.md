Output State: **`costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`. `total_costs` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. No changes are made to the existing lists or variables (`costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `func_1`). Therefore, the length and contents of `costs` remain unchanged, and `total_costs` is now an empty list.
