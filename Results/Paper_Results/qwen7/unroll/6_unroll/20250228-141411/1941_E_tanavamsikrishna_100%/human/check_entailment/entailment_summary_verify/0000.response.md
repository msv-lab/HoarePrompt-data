### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to build multiple bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports. The constraints include:
1. A support must be installed in the first and last columns of each row.
2. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
3. The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function is supposed to calculate the minimum cost to place supports in a single row, ensuring the distance constraint is met.

```python
def func_1(row, d: int):
    row[0] = 1  # Initial cost for the first support
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2  # Cost for placing supports at intervals of 1
    min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass  # Remove outdated elements
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1  # Update cost with the minimum cost from the heap
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]
```

**Issues in `func_1`:**
1. **Initial Cost Calculation**: The initial cost calculation for placing supports at intervals of 1 is incorrect. It should account for the actual depth values.
2. **Heap Operations**: The heap operations do not correctly manage the placement of supports to ensure the distance constraint is met. The while loop only removes outdated elements without ensuring the optimal placement.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost update logic is flawed. It does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to place supports while respecting the distance constraint.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
This function processes the entire grid and uses `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each row and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
```

**Function 2 Analysis:**
1. **Input Processing**: Correctly reads the input and processes each row.
2. **Cost Calculation**: Uses `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each row.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: Correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges and prints the minimum value.

#### Evaluation:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost to place supports is flawed and does not meet the problem constraints.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Despite the issues in `func_1`, the overall structure of `func_2` is correct and would work if `func_1` were implemented correctly.

Given that `func_1` is fundamentally flawed and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to place supports, the program as a whole is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports due to issues in the `func_1` function.
