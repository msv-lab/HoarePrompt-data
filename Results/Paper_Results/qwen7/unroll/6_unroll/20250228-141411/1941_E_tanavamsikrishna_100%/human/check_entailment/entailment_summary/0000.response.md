### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to build \( k \) bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports.
   - Each bridge must start and end at the river banks (cells with depth 0).
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It uses a min-heap to find the minimum cost of placing supports in the row while ensuring the distance constraint.
   - The function ensures that the first and last supports are placed correctly and updates the row accordingly.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of placing supports in that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for placing \( k \) consecutive bridges over different sets of rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct for processing a single row under the given constraints.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly iterates over all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows and calculates the total cost for each set.
   - The overall approach of finding the minimum cost by considering all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows is sound.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the logical flow of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
