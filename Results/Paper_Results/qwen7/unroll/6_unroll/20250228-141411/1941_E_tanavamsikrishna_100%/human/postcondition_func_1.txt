The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists named `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` contains \( m \) positive integers, with the first and last elements being 0. The function calculates the sum of every consecutive sub-list of length \( k \) within the list of costs derived from `rows` using `func_1`, and then finds and prints the minimum value among these sums.
