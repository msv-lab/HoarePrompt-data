Let's break down the solution to understand whether the provided program correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river to find the minimum cost of placing supports under the constraints.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a certain distance `d`.
   - For each cell from index `d` onwards, it updates the cost of placing a support in that cell based on the minimum cost found in the previous `d` cells.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire grid to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of the selected rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Checking the Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for a single row under the given constraints.
   - The function `func_2` correctly iterates through all possible starting rows for the bridges and calculates the total cost for each combination, then selects the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, with the grid dimensions being within the specified limits.
   - The function correctly processes the input and outputs the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented accurately according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
