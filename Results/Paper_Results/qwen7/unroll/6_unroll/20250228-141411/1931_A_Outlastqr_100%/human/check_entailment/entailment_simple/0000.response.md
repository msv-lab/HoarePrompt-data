Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the different ranges of the input `n` to construct the lexicographically smallest word.
2. For `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is correct because the maximum possible sum for a three-letter word starting with 'c' (i.e., 'c' = 3) is 26 + 26 + 26 = 78, and any value above 52 can only start with 'c' or later letters.
3. For `n > 27`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This covers the range from 28 to 52, which can only start with 'b' or later letters, but not 'c' or later.
4. For `n == 27`, the word is `'aay'`. This is correct because the sum 27 corresponds to the word "aay".
5. For `n <= 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This correctly handles the range from 3 to 26, which can only start with 'a'.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program should generate the correct lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
