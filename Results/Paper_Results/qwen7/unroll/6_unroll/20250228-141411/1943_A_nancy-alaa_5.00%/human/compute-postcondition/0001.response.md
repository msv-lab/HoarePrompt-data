Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, for each test case, either the smallest missing integer in the list a or the smallest integer that appears exactly once in the list (but only if it's the second unique number encountered) is printed, or if no such number exists, the loop ends without printing anything.
