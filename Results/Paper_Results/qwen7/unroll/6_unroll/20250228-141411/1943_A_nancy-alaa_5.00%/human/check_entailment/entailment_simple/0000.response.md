Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Mechanics**: The program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Alice can pick any element from the array and append it to her array `c`, whereas Bob can only delete elements without appending them to his own array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The program simply finds the smallest missing integer in the array `arr` and prints it. This approach does not consider the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The provided solution does not simulate these strategies.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the MEX directly without simulating the entire game process, which means it does not reflect the optimal play from both players.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and cannot produce the correct MEX for each test case under optimal play conditions.

Correctness: **False**
