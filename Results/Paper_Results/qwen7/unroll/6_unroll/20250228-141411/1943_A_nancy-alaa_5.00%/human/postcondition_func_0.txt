The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then determines if there is any index \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i < n \)) that does not appear in the list. If such an index exists, it prints the index. Otherwise, it checks for indices that appear exactly once in the list and prints the first one found after setting a flag. If neither condition is met for a test case, no output is generated for that case.
