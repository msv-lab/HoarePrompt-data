Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score, which is the MEX of the array `c` formed by Alice and Bob's moves.
2. The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game's process. Instead, it tries to find the smallest missing integer in the original array `a` without considering the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
3. Alice can always pick elements to form the array `c` in such a way that maximizes its MEX, and Bob can minimize it. The solution does not account for these strategic moves.
4. The logic in the provided code does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players. It simply looks for the smallest missing integer in the original array, which does not guarantee the optimal MEX value for the final array `c`.

Given the above points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the game's rules and does not find the optimal MEX value for the final array `c`.

Correctness: **False**
