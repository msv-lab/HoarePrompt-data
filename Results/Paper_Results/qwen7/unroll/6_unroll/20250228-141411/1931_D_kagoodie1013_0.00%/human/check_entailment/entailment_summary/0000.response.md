Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts. This approach ensures that the input is processed efficiently, especially for large inputs.
2. **Test Case Parsing**: It parses the input to extract the necessary information for each test case, including the size of the array (`n`), the integers `x` and `y`, and the array itself.
3. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - For each test case, it initializes counters and maps to keep track of the occurrences of numbers modulo `x` and `-num % y`.
   - It iterates through each number in the array, calculating the required modular values.
   - It updates the counts in the maps and uses these counts to determine the number of beautiful pairs.
   - The logic for updating the counts and determining the number of pairs is correct.
4. **Output**: The results for each test case are collected and printed in the required format.

Given the detailed explanation and the structure of the code, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
