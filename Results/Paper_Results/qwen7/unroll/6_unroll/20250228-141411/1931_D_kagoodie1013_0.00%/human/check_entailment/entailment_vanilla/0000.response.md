Reasoning:
1. The program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. It uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
4. For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) and updates the counts in the maps.
5. It also calculates the number of beautiful pairs by checking the counts of the required remainders in the maps.
6. The logic for calculating the number of beautiful pairs seems correct because it checks if there are other elements with the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions.
7. The program iterates through all elements of the array exactly once, making it efficient for large arrays as specified in the problem constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
