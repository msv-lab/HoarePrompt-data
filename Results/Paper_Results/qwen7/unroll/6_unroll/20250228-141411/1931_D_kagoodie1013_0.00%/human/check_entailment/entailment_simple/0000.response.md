Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs.
3. For each element in the array, it calculates the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
4. It uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of these moduli.
5. For each element, it increments the count of beautiful pairs by checking the existing counts in the dictionaries for the required conditions.
6. The logic for calculating the modulus with respect to `x` handles negative numbers correctly by using `-num % x`.
7. The final result is a list of integers, each representing the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected output based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
