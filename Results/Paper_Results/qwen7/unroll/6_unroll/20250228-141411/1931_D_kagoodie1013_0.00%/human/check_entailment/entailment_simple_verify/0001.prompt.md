You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. It uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
4. For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) and updates the counts in the maps.
5. It also calculates the number of beautiful pairs by checking the counts of the required remainders in the maps.
6. The logic for calculating the number of beautiful pairs seems correct because it checks if there are other elements with the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions.
7. The program iterates through all elements of the array exactly once, making it efficient for large arrays as specified in the problem constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.
