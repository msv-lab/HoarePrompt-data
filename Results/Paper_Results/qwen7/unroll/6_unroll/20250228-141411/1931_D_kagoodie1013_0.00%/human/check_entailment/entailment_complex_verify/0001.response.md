### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Extraction**:
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Dictionary Usage**:
   - Two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, are used to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - This is a good approach to efficiently count occurrences of specific remainders.

3. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) for each element in the array.
   - `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`, which ensures that the remainder is always non-negative.
   - `mod_y` is simply `num % y`.

4. **Count Calculation**:
   - The number of beautiful pairs is calculated by summing up the counts of the required remainders in the maps.
   - This logic is correct because it checks if there are other elements with the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program iterates through all elements of the array exactly once, making it efficient for large arrays as specified in the problem constraints.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the code that would cause incorrect results.

### Final:
**True**

The given program is correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.
