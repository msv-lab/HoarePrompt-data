### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Extraction**:
   - The program correctly reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.

2. **Use of Dictionaries**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - This is a valid approach to efficiently count occurrences of remainders.

3. **Calculation of Beautiful Pairs**:
   - For each element in the array, the program calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`).
   - It updates the counts in the maps and calculates the number of beautiful pairs by checking the counts of the required remainders in the maps.
   - The logic for calculating the number of beautiful pairs seems correct because it checks if there are other elements with the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y` that satisfy the conditions.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program iterates through all elements of the array exactly once, making it efficient for large arrays as specified in the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover various scenarios, including edge cases like identical elements in the array and different values of `x` and `y`.
   - The program handles these cases correctly based on the given function summary.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and the function summary, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
