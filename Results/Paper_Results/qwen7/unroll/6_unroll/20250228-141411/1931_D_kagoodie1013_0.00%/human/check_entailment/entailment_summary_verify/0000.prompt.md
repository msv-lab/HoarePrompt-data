You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. It calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of specific conditions met within the corresponding array based on the values of x and y. Specifically, for each number in the array, it checks how many times the number modulo x has appeared before and how many times the negative of the number modulo y has appeared before, then sums these counts to get the result for that array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses the modulo operation `-num % x` which can produce negative results, and this might not always yield the correct remainder when dealing with negative numbers. This can lead to incorrect counts of beautiful pairs.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 3`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`
- `arr = [1, 2, 3]`

According to the problem description, a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's check the pairs:
- For \(\langle 1, 2 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3\) (not divisible by 5), so it is not a beautiful pair.
- For \(\langle 1, 3 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_3 = 1 + 3 = 4\) (not divisible by 5), so it is not a beautiful pair.
- For \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\): \(a_2 + a_3 = 2 + 3 = 5\) (divisible by 5), but \(a_2 - a_3 = 2 - 3 = -1\) (not divisible by 2), so it is not a beautiful pair.

Thus, there are no beautiful pairs in this example. However, the program would incorrectly count some pairs due to the modulo operation producing negative values.

To fix this, the program should use the modulo operation `% x` instead of `-num % x` to ensure the result is always non-negative.
