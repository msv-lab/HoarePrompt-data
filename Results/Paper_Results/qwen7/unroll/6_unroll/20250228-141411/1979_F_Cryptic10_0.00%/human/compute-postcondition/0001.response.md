Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code initializes `remaining_vertices` as a set containing all integers from 1 to n (inclusive). The initial state of `n` and `path` remains unchanged. Therefore, `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers starting from 1 up to n.
