Reasoning:

1. The problem requires constructing an array \( a \) of size \( n \) such that \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) and \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).
2. The provided code attempts to solve this problem with a specific approach in the `func_1` function.
3. Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to incrementally build up the value by adding `arr[i]` to the previous element in `ans` until the condition \( a_{i+1} > x_{i+1} \) is met.
   - Finally, the last element of `ans` is set to the sum of the second last element and `arr[-1]`.

4. However, the logic in the `func_1` function has some issues:
   - The function does not ensure that the constructed `ans` array satisfies \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Instead, it seems to be trying to satisfy \( a_{i+1} > x_{i+1} \), which is not equivalent to the required modulo condition.
   - The function does not handle cases where the constructed `ans` might not meet the required conditions due to the way it increments values.

5. Given the problem constraints and the need to correctly satisfy the modulo condition, the provided solution does not seem to be correct.

Correctness: **False**
