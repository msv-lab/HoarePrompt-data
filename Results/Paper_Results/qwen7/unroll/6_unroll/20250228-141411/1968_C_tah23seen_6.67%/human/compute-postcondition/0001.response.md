Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500), `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `arr[0] + 1` to `ans[0]`. The other elements of `ans` remain as zeros since no changes were made to them. The length of `arr` and its range of values remain unchanged.
