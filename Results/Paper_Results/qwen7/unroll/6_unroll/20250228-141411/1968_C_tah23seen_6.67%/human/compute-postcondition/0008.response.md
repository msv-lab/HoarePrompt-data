Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It constructs and returns a new list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`. The last element of `ans` is the sum of the second last element and `arr[-1]`.**
