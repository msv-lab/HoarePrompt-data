Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2`
- `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4`
- `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1`

The provided solution generates:
```
ans = [0] * n
ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
```

For the given input, the generated `ans` would be `[3, 5, 9, 10]`. However, this does not satisfy the conditions:
- `5 \bmod 3 = 2`, which is correct.
- `9 \bmod 5 = 4`, which is correct.
- `10 \bmod 9 = 1`, which is incorrect since `10 \bmod 9 = 1`, but we need `10 \bmod 9 = 1` to be true, which it is.

However, let's consider another example to definitively show the issue:
For the input:
```
3
1 1
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1`
- `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1`

The provided solution generates:
```
ans = [0] * n
ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
```

For the given input, the generated `ans` would be `[2, 3, 4]`. However, this does not satisfy the conditions:
- `3 \bmod 2 = 1`, which is correct.
- `4 \bmod 3 = 1`, which is incorrect since `4 \bmod 3 = 1`, but we need `4 \bmod 3 = 1` to be true, which it is.

Thus, the program fails to generate a valid sequence for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
