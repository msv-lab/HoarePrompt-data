#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500), and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. Each element in arr represents x_i, and the length of arr is n-1.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element, it is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element, it is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`; the last element of `ans` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It constructs and returns a new list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`. The last element of `ans` is the sum of the second last element and `arr[-1]`.
