You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Computation of Total Bet Amount:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This is done using a loop where `m` is initialized to 1 and then multiplied by each `k[i]`.
   - This step is correct as it computes the total bet amount needed to ensure the condition is met if all multipliers were used.

3. **Distribution Calculation:**
   - The program then calculates a list `c` where each element is `m / k[i]`. This step is intended to find a distribution that satisfies the condition.
   - However, the logic here is flawed because the goal is to find a distribution where the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product `m`, not `m / k[i]`.

4. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand.
   - After computing the GCD, the program divides each element of `c` by the GCD. This step is also unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

5. **Validation and Output:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the elements in `c` is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - If false, it prints the elements of `c`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`.
2. Distribute the coins such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`.
3. One simple and valid approach is to set each bet to 1 (or any constant value less than `m / n`).

### Revised Program:
```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m *= k[i]
    
    # Distribute 1 coin for each outcome
    c = [1] * n
    
    if sum(c) >= m / n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors and unnecessary steps. A simpler and correct approach would be to distribute 1 coin for each outcome. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
