Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; the output consists of t lines, each line containing a list of integers of length n, where the integers are either 0 or powers of 2 based on the binary representation of k, with the last elements filled with 0s to make the list of length n.
