You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

            k = k >> 1
            i += 1

        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)

        print(*ans)

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; after executing the loop, ans is a list of length n filled with powers of 2 based on the binary representation of k, followed by zeros to make the total length of ans equal to n. If the length of ans is less than n after processing all bits of k, the remaining positions are filled with 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as inputs. It then constructs a list `ans` containing `n` elements. Each element in `ans` is set to a power of 2 based on the binary representation of `k`. If the binary representation of `k` has fewer bits than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are filled with zeros. Finally, it prints the constructed list `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR:**
   - The program constructs a sequence of numbers whose bitwise OR results in a binary number with as many 1s as possible.
   - It does this by iterating through the bits of `k` and appending the index of each set bit to the list `arr`.

3. **Constructing the Output Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the final sequence.
   - It iterates through the indices in `arr` and appends `1 << i` to `ans`, which means it adds a power of 2 corresponding to the index `i`.
   - If the length of `ans` reaches `n-1`, it calculates the remaining value needed to reach `k` and appends it to `ans`.
   - Finally, it pads the list `ans` with zeros to ensure it has exactly `n` elements.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling the Sum Constraint:**
   - The program constructs the sequence based on the binary representation of `k`, but it doesn't ensure that the sum of the sequence equals `k`. Instead, it just appends powers of 2 and zeros to meet the length requirement.

2. **Bitwise OR Calculation:**
   - The program constructs a sequence that might not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. For example, consider `n=2` and `k=3`. The correct sequence should be `[1, 2]` to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, but the program would generate `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program doesn't handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is zero or when `k` is a power of 2. It may not produce the optimal solution in these scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the sum of the sequence equals `k` and does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
