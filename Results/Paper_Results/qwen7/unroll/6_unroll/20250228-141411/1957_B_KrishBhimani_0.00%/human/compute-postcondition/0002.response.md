Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; after executing the loop, ans is a list of length n filled with powers of 2 based on the binary representation of k, followed by zeros to make the total length of ans equal to n. If the length of ans is less than n after processing all bits of k, the remaining positions are filled with 0.
