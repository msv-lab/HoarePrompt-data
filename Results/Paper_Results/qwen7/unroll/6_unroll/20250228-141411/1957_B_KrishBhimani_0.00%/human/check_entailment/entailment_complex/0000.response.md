Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `t`, `n`, and `k` from the standard input. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Binary Representation Handling**: The program constructs an array `arr` that contains the indices of the bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `k`. This is done using a while loop that iterates through the bits of `k`.

3. **Constructing the Output Array `ans`**:
   - The program initializes `ans` as an empty list.
   - It then iterates over the indices in `arr` and appends `1 << i` (which is a power of 2) to `ans`.
   - After processing all indices in `arr`, it ensures that `ans` has a length of `n` by appending zeros if necessary.

4. **Sum Condition**: The program ensures that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. This is achieved by setting the last element of `ans` to `k0 - sum(ans)` when the length of `ans` is `n-1`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the constructed list `ans` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` has fewer bits than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are filled with zeros, ensuring the sum condition is met.
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 separately, which is correct.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that satisfy both conditions: the sum of the integers is `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
