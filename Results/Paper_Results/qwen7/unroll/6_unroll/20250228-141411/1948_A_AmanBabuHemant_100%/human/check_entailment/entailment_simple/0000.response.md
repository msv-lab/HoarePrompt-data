Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
3. It checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters where a character is defined as special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that each 'B' will be a special character since it has two 'A' neighbors.
5. It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
6. The logic for constructing the string `s` ensures that every 'B' in the string is a special character, and the length of the string is always within the limit of 200 characters for even `n`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
