You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even and the string 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times is less than 200 characters long, it outputs 'YES' followed by the string. Otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it outputs `t` lines, each containing either 'NO' or 'YES' and possibly a string of 'AAB' repeated `n//2` times if the string length is less than 200.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of special characters required.

2. **Checking Parity of `n`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must have exactly one neighbor different from itself.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a string `s` consisting of the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - This ensures that every character in the generated string will be a special character except for the first and last characters, making sure the total count of special characters is `n`.

4. **String Length Check:**
   - The program then checks if the length of the generated string `s` is less than 200.
   - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the generated string.
   - If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO", which is not expected according to the problem statement since we can always generate a valid string of length up to 200 for even `n`.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for generating the string is flawed because the pattern "AAB" does not ensure that all characters are special. Only the middle characters in the pattern are special, and the first and last characters are not.
- The length check is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem guarantees that a solution exists for even `n` within the constraints.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate a string where every character is special. One way to do this is to use a repeating pattern like "AB" which ensures that each character is special.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
            print('YES')
            print(s)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed string generation logic and the unnecessary length check. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
