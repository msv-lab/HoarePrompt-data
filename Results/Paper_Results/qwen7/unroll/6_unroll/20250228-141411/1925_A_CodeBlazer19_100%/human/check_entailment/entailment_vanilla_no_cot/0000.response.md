Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly generate the shortest string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it simply repeats the first `k` lowercase letters `n` times, which does not guarantee the shortest possible string.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct the shortest supersequence that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters. This can be achieved by ensuring that each letter appears in the sequence in such a way that all combinations of length `n` are covered efficiently.

Here's a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:

```python
from itertools import product

def generate_supersequence(n, k):
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k letters
    all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Initialize the supersequence with the first character
    superseq = [all_strings[0][0]]
    
    # Add characters to ensure all strings are subsequences
    for i in range(1, len(all_strings)):
        prev_char = superseq[-1]
        next_char = all_strings[i][0]
        if next_char != prev_char:
            superseq.append(next_char)
    
    return ''.join(superseq)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        print(generate_supersequence(n, k))

func()
```

This approach constructs the shortest supersequence by ensuring that each new character added to the sequence introduces a new string of length `n` as a subsequence, thereby covering all possibilities efficiently.
