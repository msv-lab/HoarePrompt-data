You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
        
    #State: idx is 2 + 2*t, t is t, n is an integer from data[0], a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, data is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, results is a list of strings where each string is the result of the calculation for each iteration of the loop.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: each string in the `results` list, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list a of non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list a.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
