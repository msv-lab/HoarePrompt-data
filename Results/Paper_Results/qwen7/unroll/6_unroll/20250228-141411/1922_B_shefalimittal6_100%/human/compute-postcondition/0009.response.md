Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list a of non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list a. It does not return a single value but processes each test case individually, likely returning some form of result or analysis for each test case based on the given parameters.
