Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The line `idx = 0` initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `data`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
