Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list \( a \) of non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the frequency of elements in list \( a \) and stores the result. Finally, it prints these results, one per line.**
