Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code updates `t` to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. Since `idx` was initially 0, `data[idx]` refers to the first element of the `data` list. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the list. The values of `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged.
