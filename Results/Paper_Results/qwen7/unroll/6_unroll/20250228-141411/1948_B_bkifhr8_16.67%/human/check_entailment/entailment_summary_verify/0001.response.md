### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap

The goal is to determine if it is possible to transform the array into a sorted array by repeatedly performing the operation of splitting any element that is at least 10 into its constituent digits and inserting those digits back into the array.

#### Function Summary Recap

- `func_1` checks if a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Original Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if it is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - This operation is intended to help sort the array, but the implementation has some issues.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After potentially splitting elements, the program calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` simply compares the original list with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating the array is sorted.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The logic for splitting the element and inserting digits is flawed. The program should not modify the array in place during the iteration. Instead, it should simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible without actually modifying the array.
   - The current implementation directly modifies `list1`, which can lead to incorrect results if the array changes during the iteration.

2. **Missing Key Considerations:**
   - The program does not handle cases where splitting an element might create a larger number that could disrupt the sorting order.
   - The program does not consider edge cases like leading zeros or negative numbers (though the problem constraints restrict these).

3. **Incomplete Solution:**
   - The program only checks if the array can be sorted after one pass of the operation. However, the problem allows for multiple operations, so the solution needs to account for this.

#### Revised Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    while True:
        sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
        if arr == sorted_arr:
            return True
        changed = False
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i - 1] > arr[i] and arr[i - 1] >= 10:
                a = arr[i - 1]
                arr[i - 1] = a // 10
                arr.insert(i, a % 10)
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            return False

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sort_array(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the original implementation and the need to correctly simulate the operation, the provided program is still **incorrect**. The correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
