Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for an index) and `n`. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable when the index itself is not needed within the loop body.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. If `n` is zero or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be a positive integer**
