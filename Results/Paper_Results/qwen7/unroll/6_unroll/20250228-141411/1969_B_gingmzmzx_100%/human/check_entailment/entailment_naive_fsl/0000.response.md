Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in the program does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts and instead seems to be counting something else.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
101011
```

Expected output:
```
9
```

However, the program will output:
```
5
```

This discrepancy arises because the program incorrectly counts the number of zeros and ones without considering the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts. The program should focus on finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string, but it fails to do so. For instance, the optimal strategy for the string "101011" involves multiple cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order, which the current implementation does not capture.
