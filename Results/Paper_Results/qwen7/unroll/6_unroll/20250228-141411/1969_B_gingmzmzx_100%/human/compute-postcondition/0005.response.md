Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (number of binary strings) and a binary string `s`. For each binary string `s`, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the count of zeros and ones in the string. Specifically, `ans` is determined by counting the number of positions where a zero is followed by a one or vice versa, according to the given logic. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated values for each test case.**
