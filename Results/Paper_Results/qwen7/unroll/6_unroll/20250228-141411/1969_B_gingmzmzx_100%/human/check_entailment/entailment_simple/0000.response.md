Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided code reads multiple test cases, where each test case is a binary string.
3. For each binary string, the code calculates the minimum cost to sort it using the defined operations.
4. The logic in the code counts the number of zeros and uses this count to determine the cost of sorting the string.
5. The logic seems to be checking the positions of '1's relative to the count of '0's to calculate the cost.
6. The code correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.
7. The logic appears to be correct for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
