Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.
4. It uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a`, checking for the substrings "map" and "pie".
5. When it finds either "map" or "pie", it increments `ans` by 1 and skips ahead by 3 characters (since these substrings are 3 characters long).
6. If no such substrings are found, it simply increments the index `i` by 1.
7. After processing the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`.

The logic in the program is sound and correctly counts the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The program handles all the specified constraints and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
