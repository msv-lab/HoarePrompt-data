Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the string might contain both "pie" and "map" substrings. The current logic only checks for "map" and "pie" starting from the beginning of the string and increments the index by 3 every time it finds one of these substrings. This approach will miss overlapping or nested substrings that start after the initial ones have been removed.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the program correctly handles overlapping and nested substrings by iterating through the string more carefully. Here's an improved version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if a[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                ans += 1
                i += 3
            elif a[i:i+3] == 'map':
                ans += 1
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This version iterates through the string and checks for "pie" and "map" at each position, ensuring that it accounts for all occurrences of these substrings, even if they overlap or are nested within each other.
