Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function checks if all integers in the list are the same. If they are, it prints 0. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive identical elements from both the original and reversed list, adds these lengths if the first and last elements are the same, and then prints the difference between the length of the list and this sum. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
