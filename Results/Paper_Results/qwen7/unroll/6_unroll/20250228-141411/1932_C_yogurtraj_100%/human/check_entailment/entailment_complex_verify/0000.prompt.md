You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. The array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i. The string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. After executing the loop, the variable y is a list of n integers where each element y[i] (0 ≤ i < n) is calculated based on the operations inside the loop using the initial values of n, m, a, and s.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two positive integers `n` and `m`, an array `a` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a list `y` of `n` integers based on the values in `a`, the modulo `m`, and the direction indicated by `s`. Specifically, it computes each element `y[i]` by traversing the array `a` according to the directions specified in `s` and performing modular multiplications. Finally, it prints the list `y` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array `a` based on the commands. Specifically, the program calculates the product of the remaining elements but does not update the array `a` as required. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the array `a`, the modulo `m`, and the string of commands `t`. It then counts the number of 'L' commands (`l`) in the string `t`.

2. **Initial Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of the elements up to the position indicated by `l-1` or `l` and stores it in `k`. This step is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual state of the array after removing elements.

3. **Backward Iteration**: The program then iterates backward through the array, updating `k` based on whether the command is 'R' or 'L'. However, it does not correctly update the array `a` to reflect the removal of elements.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the results in reverse order, which is incorrect. The output should represent the state of the array after each command, not the final state of the array.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
4
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program produces:
```
0 2 4 1
```

This is correct for this specific example, but let's consider another case to show the issue more clearly:

Consider the input:
```
4
4 6
3 1 4 2
LLRR
```

Expected output:
```
0 0 2 4
```

But the program produces:
```
0 0 2 4
```

The issue arises because the program does not correctly update the array `a` and calculate the product for each step. Instead, it uses the initial array and incorrect logic to compute the results.

To fix this, the program needs to properly update the array `a` and calculate the product for each step according to the commands.
