### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem asks whether Bob can transform a given \(a \times b\) rectangle into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - If \(b\) is even, we can always cut the rectangle into two equal halves along the width, and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is odd, no matter how we cut the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will not allow us to form a new distinct rectangle (since the only possible cuts would result in one dimension being 1, leading to only the original dimensions or their rotations).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a function `func_1(a, b)` to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The function checks if \(b\) is even using `b % 2 == 0`.
   - If \(b\) is even, it returns 'yes', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
   - If \(b\) is odd, it returns 'no', indicating that a new rectangle cannot be formed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are 1 (i.e., \(1 \times 1\)), as it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
   - It also correctly handles cases where \(b\) is even, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle.
   - However, it does not handle the case where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, which should still allow for the formation of a new rectangle by cutting along the length \(a\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if \(b\) is even, which is not sufficient to cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
   - Specifically, if \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, the function incorrectly returns 'no'.

### Correctness:
- **False**

The function should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, not just \(b\). Hereâ€™s an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This ensures that if either dimension is even, a new rectangle can be formed.
