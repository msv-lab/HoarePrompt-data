### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is flawed because it only checks if `b` is even. This is indeed insufficient to determine if the rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle. The function should check if either `a` or `b` is even, as this covers all possible cases where the rectangle can be transformed.

Let's review the annotated code and the revised function provided in the original assessment:

1. **Annotated Code**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
       print(func_1(a, b))
   
   def func_1(a, b):
       return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
   ```

2. **Revised Function**:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
   ```

The revised function correctly checks if either `a` or `b` is even. Here's why this is correct:
- If either dimension (`a` or `b`) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form another rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be transformed into another rectangle.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the revised function accurately determines whether a rectangle can be transformed into another rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even. The revised function, which checks if either `a` or `b` is even, is correct.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**False**

Final: **False**
