Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if Bob can transform a given \(a \times b\) rectangle into another distinct rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The given solution only checks if \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this logic is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly for all cases.

Here's why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. **Cutting and Rearrangement**: The problem allows cutting the rectangle either horizontally or vertically and rearranging the pieces. Simply checking if \(b\) is even does not account for all possible ways to cut and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle, the solution would return 'yes' because \(6\) is even. However, as mentioned in the problem statement, it can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
   - For a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle, the solution would return 'no' because \(1\) is odd. But as stated, it can be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) squares, which can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 2\) rectangle, which is considered the same as the original.

3. **General Solution**: A correct approach would involve checking if either \(a\) or \(b\) can be divided into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle. This involves more complex logic than simply checking if \(b\) is even.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
