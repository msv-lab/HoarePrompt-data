Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally. However, the given program simply calculates the count of duplicate integers in each line of input, which is not related to the game logic described.

The program should simulate the game and account for the strategic moves of both players. Specifically, it needs to consider the following:
1. The initial distribution of cards.
2. The optimal strategy of Nene to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
3. The sequence of moves and the resulting points for both players.

The current implementation does not address any of these aspects and instead focuses on a different problem (counting duplicates). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
