Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func()` is designed to count the number of duplicate tokens in each line of the input, which is not relevant to the game described. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by optimally playing the game, considering Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score.

The program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the value of `n` and the list of integers representing the cards in your hand.
3. Determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, considering Nene's strategy.

However, the current implementation simply counts duplicates in the input lines, which is unrelated to the game logic. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
