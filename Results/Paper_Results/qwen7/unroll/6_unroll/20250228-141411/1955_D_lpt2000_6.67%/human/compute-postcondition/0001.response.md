Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(nabors):`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `nabors`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `nabors` is an input integer.
   - All other variables are unchanged from their initial state.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `nabors` is greater than 0. If `nabors` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `nabors` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`_`) are typically initialized by the loop itself and do not need to be explicitly adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `nabors` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0**
