Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, and all other variables are unchanged.**

The code `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. Since the input is read and assigned to `nabors`, its value is now known (an integer between 1 and 10^4), but no changes were made to the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, they remain unchanged.
