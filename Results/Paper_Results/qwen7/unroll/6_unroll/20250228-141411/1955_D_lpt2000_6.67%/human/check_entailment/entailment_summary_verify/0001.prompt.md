You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers) as inputs. It calculates the number of times the sum of the intersection of two counters (D) is greater than or equal to k during the specified operations on the lists a and b. Finally, it prints the count of such occurrences for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program aims to solve the problem by iterating through each subsegment of `aa` of length `m` and checking if it forms a good array with respect to `bb` and the required number of matches `k`.

2. The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of elements in both `aa` and `bb`.

3. It initializes counters `D`, `E`, and `C` to keep track of common elements (`D`), elements present only in `aa` but not in `bb` (`E`), and elements present only in `bb` but not in `aa` (`C`).

4. The program then iterates through each subsegment of `aa` of length `m` and updates these counters based on the changes in the elements entering and leaving the window of the subsegment.

5. For each subsegment, it calculates the total number of common elements (`tot`) and checks if this number is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments the count of good subsegments (`fnd`).

6. The logic for updating the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` seems correct, as it accounts for the removal of elements from the front of the subsegment and the addition of new elements from the back of the subsegment.

7. The program correctly handles the edge cases where elements are removed from `D` and added to `C`, and vice versa.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described.
