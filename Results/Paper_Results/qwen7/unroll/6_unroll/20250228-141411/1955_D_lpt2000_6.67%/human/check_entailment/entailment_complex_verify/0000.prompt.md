You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: fnd is the count of times tot (which is the sum of the values of the intersection counter D) is greater than or equal to k during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers) as inputs. It calculates the number of times the sum of the intersection of two counters (D) is greater than or equal to k during the specified operations on the lists a and b. Finally, it prints the count of such occurrences for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that can be rearranged to have at least `k` elements matching the elements of array `b`. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of elements in both `aa[:m]` and `bb`.
2. It calculates the intersection (`D`), elements in `aa[:m]` but not in `bb` (`E`), and elements in `bb` but not in `aa[:m]` (`C`).
3. It iterates through the array `a` and updates the counts of elements in `D`, `E`, and `C` as it slides the window of size `m`.
4. It checks if the total count of elements in `D` (i.e., common elements) is at least `k` and increments the count of good subsegments accordingly.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases as described. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
