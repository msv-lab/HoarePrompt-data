### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, it creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then reverses every other element in the list `a` (i.e., elements at even indices).

3. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify if the generated permutation satisfies the given condition.
   - Consider a permutation like `[4, 1, 2, 3]` (for \( n = 4 \)). This permutation is generated by reversing every other element in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Check the condition for this permutation:
     - For \( i = 1 \) and \( j = 3 \): \( p_1 = 4 \) and \( p_3 = 2 \). \( 4 \) does not divide \( 2 \), and \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \). \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \), but this does not violate the condition since \( p_2 \) and \( p_4 \) are not consecutive.
     - For other pairs, similar checks can be done, and it can be shown that no pair violates the condition.

4. **General Case**:
   - For any \( n \), the permutation generated by reversing every other element will ensure that no two consecutive elements in the original sequence (before reversal) will have the divisibility condition satisfied when considering their positions in the new permutation.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
