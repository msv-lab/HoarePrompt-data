Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `a` is a list where every second element starting from the first is reversed.
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

The print statement `print(a)` will print the list `a`. Since the exact elements of `a` are not specified, we can only describe it based on the given conditions.

The list `a` is described as having every second element starting from the first reversed. This means if `a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, ...]`, then after the transformation, it would become `[a1, a2[::-1], a3, a4[::-1], a5, ...]`.

However, without the actual elements of `a`, we cannot provide specific values for the reversed elements. Therefore, the output will be the list `a` with every second element starting from the first reversed.

Output: **[a1, a2[::-1], a3, a4[::-1], a5, ...]**
