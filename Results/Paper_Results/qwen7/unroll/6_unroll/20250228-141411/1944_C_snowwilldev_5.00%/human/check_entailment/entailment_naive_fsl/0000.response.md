Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The program attempts to find the minimum index `i` such that `cnt[i] == 0` or `t >= 2`, where `t` is incremented when `cnt[i] == 1`. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This happens because the program only checks for the first occurrence of `cnt[i] == 0` or `t >= 2`, without considering the optimal moves of both players. In an optimal game, Alice would try to maximize the MEX, and Bob would try to minimize it. The provided solution does not simulate these strategic choices.

A correct solution would involve simulating the game with both players making optimal moves, which is more complex than the current implementation.
