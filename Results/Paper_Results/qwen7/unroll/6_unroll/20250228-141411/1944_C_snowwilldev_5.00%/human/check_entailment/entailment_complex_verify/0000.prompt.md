You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of N non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < N. The sum of all N values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, the variable `i` is the first integer in the list `a` that either appears exactly once or causes the count of any previously seen integer to reach zero, or `i` is the last integer in the list `a` if no such integer is found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \(N\), a list of \(N\) non-negative integers \(a\), and calculates a value \(t\). It then finds the first integer in the list \(a\) that either appears exactly once or causes the count of any previously seen integer to reach zero. If such an integer is found, it prints the integer and breaks the loop; otherwise, it prints the last integer in the list \(a\). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The program attempts to find the minimum index `i` such that `cnt[i] == 0` or `t >= 2`, where `t` is incremented when `cnt[i] == 1`. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This happens because the program only checks for the first occurrence of `cnt[i] == 0` or `t >= 2`, without considering the optimal moves of both players. In an optimal game, Alice would try to maximize the MEX, and Bob would try to minimize it. The provided solution does not simulate these strategic choices.

A correct solution would involve simulating the game with both players making optimal moves, which is more complex than the current implementation.
