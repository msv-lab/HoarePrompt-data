You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \(N\), a list of \(N\) non-negative integers \(a\), and calculates a value \(t\). It then finds the first integer in the list \(a\) that either appears exactly once or causes the count of any previously seen integer to reach zero. If such an integer is found, it prints the integer and breaks the loop; otherwise, it prints the last integer in the list \(a\). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the counts and increments `t` whenever an element appears exactly once.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if an element count becomes zero, it prints the current index `i`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The code does not simulate the game correctly. It does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed because it does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
   - The code does not handle the game dynamics where Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob can strategically remove elements to minimize it.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will always pick the largest available element to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy involves keeping track of the smallest and largest elements available at each turn.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules and does not simulate the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
