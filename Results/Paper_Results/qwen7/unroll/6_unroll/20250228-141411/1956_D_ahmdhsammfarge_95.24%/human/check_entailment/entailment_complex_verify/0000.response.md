### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function aims to find the subarray that, when modified, would yield the maximum sum. However, it calculates the sum incorrectly. It sums the elements before and after the subarray and adds \((j - i + 1) ** 2\), which is not relevant to the problem. The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value should be computed for each subarray and used to update the subarray, but this function does not do that.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is intended to recursively apply operations, but it does not correctly handle the operations needed to maximize the sum. It simply appends operations without considering the MEX value.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function also does not correctly implement the logic. It appends operations without updating the array based on the MEX value, and it does not handle the subarray updates properly.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program reads the input, initializes the operations list, and calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray. Then, it repeatedly calls `func_3` to modify the subarray and update the operations list. Finally, it tries to set all zeros to one to ensure the array is fully updated.
- However, the logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` is flawed as explained above. The program does not correctly compute the MEX value for each subarray and update the array accordingly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
