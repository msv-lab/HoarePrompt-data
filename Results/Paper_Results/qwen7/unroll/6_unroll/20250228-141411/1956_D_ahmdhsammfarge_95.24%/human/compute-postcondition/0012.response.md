Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers with the constraint that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list used to store operations. The function replaces the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`, and returns the modified list.**
