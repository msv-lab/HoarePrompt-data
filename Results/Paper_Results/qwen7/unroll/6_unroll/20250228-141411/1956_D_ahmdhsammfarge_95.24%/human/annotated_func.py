#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns a pair of indices \( r \) and \( l \) (which are the same) that correspond to the subarray within the list which maximizes the value of \((j - i + 1)^2 + \text{sum}(lst[:i]) + \text{sum}(lst[j + 1:])\).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r`, `l`, and `ops`. It does not return any value. If `r` equals `l`, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and terminates. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1`, appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list, and then calls itself again with `l - 1`. This process continues until `r` equals `l`, at which point it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and stops.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)` and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list used to store the operations performed.

    #State: Postcondition: `ops` is a list containing the elements `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the condition holds as specified. If the minimum value is not 0, the condition still holds but no additional changes are made to `ops`.

    return lst
    #The program returns a list where the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each being `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers with the constraint that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list used to store operations. The function first appends the same operation twice to the `ops` list, then calls another function `func_2(r, l, ops)`. It calculates the length `n` of the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`, replaces this sublist with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`, and finally returns the modified list. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the operation is appended twice; otherwise, it is appended once.
