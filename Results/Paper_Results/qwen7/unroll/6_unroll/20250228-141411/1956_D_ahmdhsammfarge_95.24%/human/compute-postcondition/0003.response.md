Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the elements `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` initially contained `[r + 1, l + 1]`, after appending, `ops` now contains both `[r + 1, l + 1]` twice. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and the condition about the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains valid.
