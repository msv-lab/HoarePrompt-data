You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers with the constraint that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list used to store operations. The function first appends the same operation twice to the `ops` list, then calls another function `func_2(r, l, ops)`. It calculates the length `n` of the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`, replaces this sublist with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`, and finally returns the modified list. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the operation is appended twice; otherwise, it is appended once.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to perform the operation on to maximize the sum.
   - It calculates the sum of elements excluding each possible subarray and keeps track of the maximum sum and corresponding subarray indices.
   - However, the logic here seems flawed because it does not actually calculate the MEX value but instead sums elements in a way that doesn't align with the MEX definition.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function recursively generates a sequence of operations to set the entire array to a specific value.
   - It is called within `func_3` to generate the sequence of operations.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function performs the actual operation on the identified subarray.
   - It sets the subarray to the MEX value and then recursively calls itself to ensure the entire array is set to this value.
   - The function also updates the array to reflect the new values.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the MEX value. It simply sums elements in a way that doesn't align with the problem requirements.

2. **Recursive Operation Generation in `func_2` and `func_3`:**
   - While the recursive approach in `func_2` and `func_3` seems to aim at setting the entire array to the MEX value, the base case and recursive steps do not correctly handle the MEX calculation and updating the array.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly in how the MEX value is calculated and applied, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
