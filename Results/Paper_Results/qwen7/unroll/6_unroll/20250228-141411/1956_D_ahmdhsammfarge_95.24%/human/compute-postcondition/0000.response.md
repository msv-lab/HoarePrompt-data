Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the element `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`.**

This means that the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been appended to the list `ops`, and the values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, except they are now referenced as `r + 1` and `l + 1` within the list `ops`.
