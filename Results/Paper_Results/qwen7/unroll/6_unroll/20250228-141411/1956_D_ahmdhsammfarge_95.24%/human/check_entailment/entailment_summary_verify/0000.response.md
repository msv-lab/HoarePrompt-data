### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided functions and their summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the subarray that, when modified, would yield the maximum sum.
   - It calculates the sum of elements before and after the subarray and adds \((j - i + 1)^2\), which is irrelevant to the problem.
   - The MEX value should be computed for each subarray and used to update the subarray, but this function does not do that.
   - The logic here is flawed because it does not consider the MEX value at all.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to recursively apply operations, but it does not correctly handle the operations needed to maximize the sum.
   - It simply appends operations without considering the MEX value.
   - The function does not update the array based on the MEX value, making it ineffective.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function appends operations without updating the array based on the MEX value.
   - It does not handle the subarray updates properly.
   - The function does not ensure that the subarray is updated to the MEX value of the subarray, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.

Given these observations, the original assessment is accurate. The functions do not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the provided analysis.
