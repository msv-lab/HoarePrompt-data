Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the elements `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `r` is an integer, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`**.

Explanation: The function `func_2(r, l, ops)` is called with the given parameters. However, since the function `func_2` is not defined, no changes are made to the variables `ops`, `r`, or `l`. The additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]` was already present in the list `ops` before the function call, so no new elements are added. Therefore, the values of `ops`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
