### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of that subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the input array `lst` and initializes an empty list `ops` to store operations.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to find the subarray with the maximum possible sum after applying the operation. However, the logic inside this function is flawed. Specifically, the nested loops and the calculation of `sm` do not correctly reflect the MEX operation and the objective of maximizing the sum.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function is never called in the provided code, and its purpose is unclear from the context.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function is also not called in the provided code, and its purpose is unclear. It seems to add operations to `ops` and modify the list `lst`, but the logic is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - **Main Logic**: The main logic after calling `func_1` is to fill the array with ones starting from the first occurrence of zero. This part of the logic is not aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum using the MEX operation.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the objective of maximizing the sum of the array.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not align with the problem's requirements and are not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic after `func_1` does not use the MEX operation to maximize the sum, but instead fills the array with ones starting from the first zero, which is not optimal.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
