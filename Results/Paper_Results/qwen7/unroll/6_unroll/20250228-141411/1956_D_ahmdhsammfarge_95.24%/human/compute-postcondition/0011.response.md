Output State: **The program returns a list where the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each being `n`.**

Given the initial state:
- `ops` is a list containing the elements `[l + 2, l + 2]`, `[l + 2, l + 2]`, `[l + 2, l + 2]`, and `[l + 2, l + 1]`.
- `n` is `l - r + 1`.

The code snippet `return lst;` indicates that the function returns the list `lst`. The key operation here is replacing the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we know that `n = l - r + 1`. Therefore, the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each being `n`. 

Thus, the output state is as described above.
