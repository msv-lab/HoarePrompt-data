Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given \( n \) and \( x \), where \( k \) is the length of the repeating segment in the "firstâ€“k-th" position arrangement.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The arrangement repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The value of \( k \) must satisfy certain conditions derived from the position \( x \) and the total number of positions \( n \).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even because \( 2k - 2 \) must be even.
   - It uses the `func_1` function to find divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - The logic for filtering valid \( k \) values is correct based on the conditions provided.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function finds all divisors of \( x \) and their corresponding quotients.
   - It returns these divisors in a specific order (reverse of square root divisors followed by their quotients).

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program correctly filters out valid \( k \) values.
   - The use of sets ensures no duplicates are counted.
   - The overall structure and logic align with the problem requirements.

Conclusion:
The provided code accurately implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.

Correctness: **True**
