Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9; `output1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `output1` as an empty list. Since no operations are performed on `x` and `n`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `output1` and retains the initial values of `x` and `n`.
