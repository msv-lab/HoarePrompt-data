Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given \( n \) and \( x \), where \( k \) is the length of the repeating sequence in the "firstâ€“k-th" position arrangement.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The sequence repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The position \( x \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya must fit within the repeating pattern.
   - We need to find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even.
   - It uses the function `func_1` to get all divisors of these numbers.
   - It filters these divisors to find those that are greater than or equal to \( x \) and form valid \( k \) values.

5. **Set Conversion**:
   - Using `set` ensures that each \( k \) value is unique.
   - The length of the resulting set gives the number of valid \( k \) values.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is explicitly excluded since the settling does not exist for \( k = 1 \).

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
