The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). It calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\), and based on certain conditions, prints one of the following outputs for each test case: \(k\), \(1\), \(2\), or \(k - q\), where \(q\) is derived from the binary representation of \(k\). The function reads the number of test cases from the first line of input, followed by pairs of integers for each test case.
