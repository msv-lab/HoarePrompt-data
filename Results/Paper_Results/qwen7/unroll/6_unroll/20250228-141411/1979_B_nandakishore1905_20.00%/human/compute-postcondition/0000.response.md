Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that gets incremented in each iteration.
   - `input()`: This function call reads an input from the user.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(int(input()))` generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value returned by `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `input()` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the State**: Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input read by `int(input())` is at least 1. Since `t` is provided as part of the initial state, we can use `t` to represent the expected input value.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0 (initial value).
- The input read by `int(input())` must be at least 1, which can be represented by the condition that `t` (the initial value of `t`) must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be at least 1**
