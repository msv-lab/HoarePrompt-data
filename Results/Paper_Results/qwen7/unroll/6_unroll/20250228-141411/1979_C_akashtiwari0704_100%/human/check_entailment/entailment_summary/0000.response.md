Reasoning:
1. The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
2. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers (`k_i`) for each test case.
3. Each multiplier `k_i` is then replaced with the LCM divided by `k_i`.
4. The sum of these new values is compared to the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it means no valid distribution exists, so `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the modified values are printed.

Given the logic:
- The LCM calculation ensures that the sum of the modified values is minimized while still being a multiple of each original `k_i`.
- Dividing the LCM by each `k_i` ensures that the sum of these values is less than the LCM itself, satisfying the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

The provided execution summary aligns with the problem statement and the logic implemented in the code. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
