### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the reasoning further to ensure the program meets the requirements and is indeed correct.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the list of multipliers `a`.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Calculation:**
   - The `lcm` function correctly computes the LCM of the list `a` using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - The LCM is used to ensure that the bet amounts are maximized while keeping them as integers.

3. **Bet Distribution Calculation:**
   - For each outcome, the bet amount is calculated as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - This ensures that the bet amount is the largest possible integer that is a multiple of `a[i]`.

4. **Sum Check:**
   - The program sums up the bet amounts and checks if the total sum is less than `prod`.
   - If the sum is less than `prod`, it means the total bet is strictly less than the total winnings for any winning outcome.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1`, indicating no feasible solution.

5. **Output Construction:**
   - If a feasible solution exists, the program constructs and prints the bet distribution.

### Testing the Program with Provided Examples

Let's retest the program with the provided examples to ensure it handles all edge cases correctly:

     3 2 7
     2
     3 3
     5
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     27 41 12 
     1 1 
     -1
     ```

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     6
     7
     7 9 3 17 9 13 5
     3
     6 3 2
     5
     9 4 6 8 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
     -1
     8 18 12 9 24
     ```
