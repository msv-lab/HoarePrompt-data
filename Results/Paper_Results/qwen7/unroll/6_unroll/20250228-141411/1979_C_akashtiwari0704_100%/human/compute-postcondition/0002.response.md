Output State: **The output state depends on the input values of `t`, `bets`, and the list `a`. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `T`), the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in list `a`, then modifies the list by dividing the LCM by each element. It sums these modified values. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the modified list elements separated by spaces. This process repeats `t` times. The final output will be the result of the last iteration of the outer loop.**
