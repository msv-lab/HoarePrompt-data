You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1

    -1

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

    #State: The output state depends on the input values of `t`, `bets`, and the list `a`. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `T`), the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in list `a`, then modifies the list by dividing the LCM by each element. It sums these modified values. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the modified list elements separated by spaces. This process repeats `t` times. The final output will be the result of the last iteration of the outer loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple of the list `a`.
   - This is done using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

3. **Distributing Coins:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the required bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then sums up these bet amounts to check if the total bet is less than or equal to `prod`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total bet (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to `prod`, the program prints `-1` indicating no feasible solution.
   - Otherwise, it constructs and prints the bet distribution.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Key Points:
- **Largest Bet Calculation:** The bet for each outcome is calculated as `prod // a[i]`. This ensures that the bet is the largest possible value while still being an integer.
- **Sum Check:** The sum of these bets is checked against `prod`. If the sum is less than `prod`, it means the total bet is strictly less than the total winnings for any winning outcome.
- **Feasibility:** The program correctly identifies when a solution is impossible by checking if the sum of bets exceeds `prod`.

#### Potential Issues:
- The approach seems sound, but we need to ensure that the bet values do not exceed the upper limit of \(10^9\).
- The calculation of `prod` should handle large numbers properly to avoid overflow.
