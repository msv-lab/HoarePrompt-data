Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
3. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function.
4. It then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bet amounts.
5. The program checks if the sum of these bet amounts is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Let's verify the logic step-by-step:

- **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- **Calculating LCM**: The `lcm` function correctly computes the least common multiple of the multipliers.
- **Bet Calculation**: The bet amounts are calculated correctly by dividing the LCM by each multiplier.
- **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the bet amounts is less than the LCM. If it is, the conditions of the problem are satisfied, and the program outputs the bet amounts. If not, it outputs `-1`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
