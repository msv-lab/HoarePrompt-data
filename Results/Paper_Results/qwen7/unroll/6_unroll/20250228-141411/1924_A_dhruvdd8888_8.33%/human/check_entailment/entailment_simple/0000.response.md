### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occurs as a subsequence in the given string `s`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - It then checks if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to track the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - If the number of times a set of `k` unique characters is fully collected (`ps`) is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and provides a counterexample string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly identifies the first `k` lowercase letters.
   - It uses a sliding window to track the last `k` unique characters.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it correctly prints "NO" and provides a counterexample string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `ps < n` correctly by printing "NO" and providing a counterexample string.
   - The logic for determining the counterexample string is correct.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program follows the problem specification accurately.
   - It correctly identifies when all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - It correctly provides a counterexample when necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness: **True**
