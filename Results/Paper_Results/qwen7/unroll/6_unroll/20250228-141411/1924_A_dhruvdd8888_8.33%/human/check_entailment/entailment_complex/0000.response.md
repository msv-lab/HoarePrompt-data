Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
- It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- It uses a set `win` to keep track of the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`.
- It uses a list `ans` to store these characters when they form a complete set of `k` unique characters.
- The variable `ps` counts how many times a complete set of `k` unique characters is found in `s`.
- After processing the string `s`, the program checks if `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.
  - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
  - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints "NO" and then prints a string that represents a sequence of characters that cannot be found as a subsequence in `s`.

Given the logic and the state transitions described, the program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
