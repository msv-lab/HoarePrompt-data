You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. Additionally, s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is a set that may contain up to `k` lowercase letters from the string `s`; `ans` is a list that contains the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, each repeated once for each time they were the `k`th unique character encountered; `ps` is an integer representing the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was fully collected from `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is a set that may contain up to `k` lowercase letters from the string `s`; `ans` is a list that contains the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, each repeated once for each time they were the `k`th unique character encountered; `ps` is an integer representing the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was fully collected from `s`. The value of `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is a set that may contain up to `k` lowercase letters from the string `s`; `ans` is a list that contains the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, each repeated once for each time they were the `k`th unique character encountered; `ps` is an integer representing the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was fully collected from `s`, incremented by the number of times the loop executed; `i` is the last character printed in the loop, which is one of the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t, n, k, m, and s, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, n and k are integers between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising the first k lowercase English alphabets. After processing these variables, the function prints 'YES' if certain conditions are met.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
