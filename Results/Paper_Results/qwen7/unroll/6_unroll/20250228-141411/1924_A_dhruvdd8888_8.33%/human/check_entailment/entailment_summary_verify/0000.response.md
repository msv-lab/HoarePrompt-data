### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given test cases.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The task is to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
- If not, print 'NO' and a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` processes a string `s` and checks if it contains at least `n` sets of the first `k` unique lowercase English alphabets.
- If it finds at least `n` such sets, it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and outputs a specific string based on the missing characters.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
- It uses a set `us` to store the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- It maintains a set `win` to track the last `k` unique characters encountered in `s`.
- It iterates through `s` and updates `win` when a character from `us` is found.
- If `win` has `k` unique characters, it appends the character to `ans` and clears `win`.
- After processing `s`, it checks if `ps` (the count of complete sets of `k` unique characters) is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans` based on the missing characters.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 2 4\nabba`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: All possible strings of length 2 (aa, ab, ba, bb) using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `abba`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 2 3\nabb`
   - Expected Output: `NO\naa`
   - Explanation: The string `aa` is not a subsequence of `abb`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 3 10\naabbccabab`
   - Expected Output: `NO\nccc`
   - Explanation: The string `ccc` is a valid string of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`) but is not a subsequence of `aabbccabab`.

#### Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
- It handles the case where `ps` (the count of complete sets of `k` unique characters) is less than `n` and prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string based on the missing characters.
- The program logic aligns with the problem description and the function summary.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality.

### Final:
**True**
