You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` and checks if it contains at least `n` sets of the first `k` unique lowercase English alphabets. If it finds at least `n` such sets, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and then outputs a specific string based on the missing characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occurring as a subsequence of `s`. Specifically, the program does not consider all combinations of characters but rather focuses on the last `k` unique characters encountered in the string `s`.

For instance, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

Output of the given program:
```
YES
NO
aa
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc
```

In the third test case, the string `ccc` is a valid string of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`) but is not considered by the program because it does not track all possible subsequences of length `n`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it checks all possible subsequences of length `n` and not just the last `k` unique characters encountered in the string `s`.
