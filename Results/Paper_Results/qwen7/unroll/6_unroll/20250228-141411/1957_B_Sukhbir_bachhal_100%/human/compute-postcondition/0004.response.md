State right before the while loop, the variable `position` is 0.

The loop condition is `n != 0`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero. Since no information about `n` is given in the initial state, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero.

State: **`position` is 0 and `n` must not be 0**
