Output State: **`T` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
