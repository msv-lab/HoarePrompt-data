#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and num2 is not used in the function and can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and order is the number of adjacent pairs (i-1, i) in the list `a` where the element at index i-1 is greater than or equal to the element at index i.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if there are no adjacent pairs in the list where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element; otherwise, it returns `False`.
