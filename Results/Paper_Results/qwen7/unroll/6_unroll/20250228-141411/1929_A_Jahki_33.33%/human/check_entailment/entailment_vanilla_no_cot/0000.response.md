Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not necessary**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check is not needed for finding the maximum beauty of the array. The maximum beauty can always be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty.

2. **Sorting and Calculation**: The logic for calculating the maximum beauty is correct. By sorting the array and then calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, we ensure that the beauty is maximized. However, the function `func_1` complicates the code unnecessarily.

3. **Simplification**: The code can be simplified by removing the unnecessary function and directly calculating the beauty after sorting the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    # Sort the array
    b = sorted(a)
    # Calculate the beauty
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This version removes the unnecessary function and directly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and computing the required sum.
