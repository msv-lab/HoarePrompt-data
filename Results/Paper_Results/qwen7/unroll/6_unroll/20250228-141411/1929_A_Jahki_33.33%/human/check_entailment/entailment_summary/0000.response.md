Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

Let's break down the program and compare it with the problem statement:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Rearranging Elements**: The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty using the sorted array. This approach works because the maximum beauty can be achieved by ensuring that the smallest elements are placed at the beginning and the largest elements are placed at the end of the array. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`. However, this function is not used in the main logic of calculating the beauty, so it does not affect the correctness of the program.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and then calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
