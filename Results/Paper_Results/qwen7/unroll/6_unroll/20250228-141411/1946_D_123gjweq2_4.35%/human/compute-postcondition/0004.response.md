Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a segment of the input array a, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
