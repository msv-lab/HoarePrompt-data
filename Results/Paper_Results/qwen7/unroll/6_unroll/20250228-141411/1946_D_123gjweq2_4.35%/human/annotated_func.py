#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, an integer representing the current bit position. It returns the length of the list `cur_arr` if the bit position is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list to find the maximum value based on the specified bit position and returns either -1, the length of a new processed list, or the maximum value found.
