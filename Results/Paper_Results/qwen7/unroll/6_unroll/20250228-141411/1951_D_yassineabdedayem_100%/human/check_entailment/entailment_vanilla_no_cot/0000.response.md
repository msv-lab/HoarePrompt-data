Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly handle all test cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `7 3`, the expected output is "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their respective prices. The given solution prints "YES" and "1" for the number of stalls but incorrectly prints "1" as the price, which doesn't match the example solution.
   - For the input `6 4`, the expected output is "NO", but the given solution incorrectly prints "YES".
   - For the input `255 8`, the solution should also print "YES" with the correct number of stalls and their respective prices, but the given solution fails to do so.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The logic in the current implementation is flawed. It does not correctly distribute the number of jewels across the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The condition `if n == k` is too restrictive and does not cover all scenarios where `n` and `k` might allow for a valid distribution of jewels across stalls.
   - The condition `elif n + 2 > k * 2` is also overly simplistic and does not account for the correct distribution of jewels.

A correct solution would involve more complex logic to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by distributing the number of coins across the stalls appropriately.
