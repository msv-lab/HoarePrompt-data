Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether the conditions for t and n are met and returns appropriate results based on these conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value for t and n, and checks if t is within the range 1 to 10^3 and n is within the range 3 to 10^5, with the total sum of n values not exceeding 10^5. The function then returns results based on these conditions for each test case.
