Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a permutation that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to construct the permutation `p` does not ensure that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (with \(1 \leq i, j < n\); \(i \neq j\)) exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

Let's break down why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Odd and Even Indices Handling**: The code separates the permutation into odd and even indices and fills them with values in a specific manner. However, this approach does not guarantee that no two pairs \((p_i, p_{i+1})\) and \((p_j, p_{j+1})\) will satisfy the divisibility condition.
   
2. **Divisibility Check**: The problem requires ensuring that no two pairs of consecutive elements in the permutation satisfy the divisibility condition. The current implementation does not consider this constraint properly.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve generating a permutation where the values are chosen in such a way that no two consecutive pairs violate the divisibility condition. One possible strategy is to use a simple and effective permutation like `[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, ...]`, which ensures that no two consecutive pairs will have the required divisibility property.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(range(1, n + 1))
        # Shuffle the permutation to ensure randomness and avoid trivial patterns
        import random
        random.shuffle(p)
        while True:
            valid = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if p[i] % p[i + 1] == 0 or p[i + 1] % p[i] == 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                break
            else:
                random.shuffle(p)
        print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This approach shuffles the permutation until it finds a valid one that satisfies the conditions. This method is more robust and ensures the correctness of the solution.
