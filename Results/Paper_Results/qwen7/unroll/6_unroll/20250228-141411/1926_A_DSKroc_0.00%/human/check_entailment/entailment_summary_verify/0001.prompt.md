You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a specified number of input strings, each consisting of 5 characters ('A' or 'B'), and counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. After processing all strings, it prints 'A' if the total count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the comparison between the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters across all input strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `ac` and `bc`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences, the program compares the counts and prints the character that appears more frequently. This part of the logic is also correct.
4. **Edge Cases**: Since the problem specifies that the strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B', there are no edge cases where the counts could be equal (i.e., `ac == bc`), which simplifies the logic.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement guarantees that all strings in a test are distinct, so the program does not need to handle duplicate strings.

Given these points, the program should work correctly for the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
