The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings consist of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. It swaps the first half of the characters in `x` with the corresponding characters in `y` in ascending order, and swaps the second half of the characters in `y` with the corresponding characters in `x` in descending order. The function then prints the modified strings `a` and `b`, which are the initial values of `x` and `y` respectively.
