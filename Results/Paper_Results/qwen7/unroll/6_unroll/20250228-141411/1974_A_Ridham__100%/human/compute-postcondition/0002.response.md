State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, result is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(n)`, which means the loop will iterate `n` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The variables `t` and `result` are not directly involved in the loop condition or its execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute, which means `n` must be greater than 0.

Note: Although `t` is within a specific range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), this information is not relevant to the loop's execution condition. Thus, it does not need to be included in the adjusted state for the loop to execute.
