Output State: **`max_sum` is the sum of the largest subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the range of the largest subarray with non-negative elements as [start_index, end_index], `segments_variants` is a list of all subarray ranges with non-negative sums, and `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Explanation: The line `total_max_segment = [-1]` initializes a new list `total_max_segment` with the value `[-1]`. This does not affect the values of `max_sum`, `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, or `segments_variants`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
