t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The function mod(number) is used to return the remainder of a number modulo 10^9 + 7.
