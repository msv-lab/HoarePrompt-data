### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The function `func_1()` takes care of processing each test case. It reads `n` (the number of friends) and initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with the first element as 0 and the rest as integers from the input list `p`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each friend `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if `i` and `v[i]` are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, the function prints `2` and returns immediately.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, the function prints `3`.

3. **Output**:
   - If there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, the function prints `2` and returns.
   - If no such pair exists, the function prints `3`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. Specifically, it mentions the input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```
In this case, no friend is the best friend of another friend. The current implementation always prints `2` or `3`, which is incorrect because sending invitations to just 2 friends cannot guarantee that at least 2 friends will come. The correct output for this case should be `4`, as Monocarp needs to invite all friends individually to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

However, let's re-evaluate the logic of the annotated code:
- The function correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` in such cases.
- If no such pairs are found, the function prints `3`. This means that the function assumes that inviting 3 friends (one of whom might be a best friend of another) is sufficient to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function's logic is sound. Here's why:
- If there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the function correctly prints `2`.
- If no such pairs exist, the function prints `3`, which implies that inviting 3 friends (one of whom might be a best friend of another) is sufficient to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. This is a reasonable assumption based on the problem statement.

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect because the function does handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends correctly by printing `3`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.
