Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` sorts the elements in the `nums` set after converting them into integers. Since sets are unordered collections, after converting the set to a list using `map(int, nums)`, the resulting `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.
