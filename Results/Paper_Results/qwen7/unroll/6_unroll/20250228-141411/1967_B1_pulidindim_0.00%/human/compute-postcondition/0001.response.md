Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. The other variables (`n` and `m`) are not mentioned in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1**
