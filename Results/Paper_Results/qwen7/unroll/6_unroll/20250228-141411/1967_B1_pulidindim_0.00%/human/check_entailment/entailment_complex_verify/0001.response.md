### Reasoning

Let's revisit the problem and the provided code with a more detailed analysis.

#### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This initialization does not reflect the correct logic for counting valid pairs.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `m`. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Variables `g` and `countmins`:**
   - These variables are used in a manner that does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, `g` is calculated as `n / count`, and `countmins` is `count - 1`. These calculations do not help in determining valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Break Condition:**
   - The break condition `if g < countmins:` is not relevant to the problem and does not help in correctly identifying valid pairs.

Given these observations, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's verify this by comparing the annotated code with the problem statement and the original assessment.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected approach:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, min(m + 1, a + 1)):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected approach iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the detailed analysis and the corrected approach, the original assessment was accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
