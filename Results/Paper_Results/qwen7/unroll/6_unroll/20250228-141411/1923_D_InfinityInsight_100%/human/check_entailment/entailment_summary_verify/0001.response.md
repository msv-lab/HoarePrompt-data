### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided code does not fully cover all edge cases and might fail in certain scenarios where a slime is impossible to eat. Let's re-evaluate the code and the function summaries to ensure the logic is sound and covers all necessary cases.

#### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The `left` list is correctly calculated as the prefix sum of the array `a`.

2. **Finding the Position Using Binary Search:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly finds the position where the current slime's size minus one would fit in the sorted cumulative sum list.

3. **Updating the Answer List:**
   - The logic for updating the `ans` list based on the position found using `func_1` and considering the last occurrence index seems correct.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles cases where a slime can eat a neighbor but not others.
   - The code also correctly sets `ans[i]` to `-1` if no valid position is found or if the position is less than 0.

#### Detailed Verification:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` is initialized to store cumulative sums of the array elements.
   - `last` is initialized to store the last index where each unique element appears.
   - `ans` is initialized to `-1` for each slime.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - `left` is built to store the prefix sums of the array `a`.

3. **Processing Each Slime:**
   - For each slime at index `i`, the code checks if it can eat the previous slime (`a[i] > a[i-1]`).
   - If the current slime can eat the previous slime, it sets `ans[i]` to 1.
   - If the current slime cannot eat the previous slime, it calculates the required prefix sum `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
   - It uses `func_1` to find the position where `x` would fit in the sorted cumulative sum list.
   - It updates `ans[i]` based on the position found, considering the last occurrence index (`last[i-1]`).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles cases where a slime cannot eat any neighbor by setting `ans[i]` to `-1`.
   - The use of `func_1` and `last` ensures that the position is correctly determined even when multiple occurrences of the same value exist.

### Re-evaluation of the Function Summaries:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function correctly finds the position where `x` would fit in the sorted list `a` using binary search.
  - It returns the correct index if `x` fits in the list, otherwise, it returns the correct insertion point.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly initializes the necessary lists and iterates through the array to update the `ans` list.
  - It handles both cases where a slime can eat a neighbor and where it cannot.
  - The use of `last` ensures that the position is correctly determined even when multiple occurrences of the same value exist.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the code and the function summaries, the logic appears to be correct and covers all necessary cases. The original assessment might have missed some edge cases, but the provided code seems to handle them appropriately.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
