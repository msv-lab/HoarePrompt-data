Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state before the loop, we know that `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` up to that point.
   - `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in `a` before it changes.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - This means that the loop will start when `i` is 1 and continue until `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to set `i` to 1.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop can execute. This means `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts at 1).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` up to that point; `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in `a` before it changes; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**.
