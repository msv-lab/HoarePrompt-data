The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`. Each element in `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if the current element in `a` is less than the previous one, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is determined by subtracting the current element from the cumulative sum up to that point (`left[i]`) and finding the appropriate index using `func_1(left, x)`, considering the last occurrence index (`last[i-1]`). If no valid `inx` is found or if `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains -1.
