Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in the provided functions aligns with the problem statement and the expected behavior described in the execution summaries.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a size.
   - Every second, a slime eats one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to find the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten or determine if it is impossible.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find the position of a value in a sorted list.
   - It returns the index of the value if found, otherwise `-1`.
   - This function is used in `func_2` to help determine the position of certain values.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - It uses two lists: `left` to store cumulative sums and `last` to store the last occurrence of each unique value.
   - For each slime, it checks if it can eat its left neighbor directly or indirectly through cumulative sums and last occurrences.
   - It updates the answer list `ans` based on these checks.

4. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` twice: once for the original list and once for the reversed list.
   - It then compares the results and takes the minimum value for each slime, ensuring consistency.

Given the detailed descriptions and the logical flow of the functions, the implementation seems to correctly follow the problem statement and the expected behavior. The main program ensures that both directions (forward and backward) are considered, which is crucial for handling all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
