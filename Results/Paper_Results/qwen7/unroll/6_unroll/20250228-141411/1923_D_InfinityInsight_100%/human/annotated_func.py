#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` containing positive integers and an integer `x`. It searches for the value `x` in the list `a`. If `x` is found at index `inx`, it returns `inx + 1`. If `x` is not found in the list, it returns `-1`. If `x` is negative, it immediately returns `-1`.
