Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**:
   - **`left`**: This list is initially empty or contains a single element `[0]`. Since the loop hasn't started yet, we don't need to change this list.
   - **`last`**: This list is initialized such that each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in `a` before it changes. Since no elements have changed yet, each element in `last` should be -1 (as per the given initial state).
   - **`ans`**: This list is initialized to contain `-1` for each element of length `n`. Since no elements have been processed yet, each element remains `-1`.
   - **`i`**: This variable will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration. Since the loop hasn't started, `i` is not yet assigned any value from `a`.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is the iterable `a`, because the loop depends on the elements of `a` to proceed. However, since the initial state of `a` is not provided, we cannot make specific adjustments to `a`. Instead, we focus on ensuring that the loop can start by having `a` as an iterable with at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it has at least one element.

**State:**
**`left` is a list containing 0; `last` is a list where each element is -1; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1; `a` must be a non-empty list**
