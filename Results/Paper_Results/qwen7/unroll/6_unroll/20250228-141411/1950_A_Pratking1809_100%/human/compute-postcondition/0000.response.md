Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `q = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `q`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
