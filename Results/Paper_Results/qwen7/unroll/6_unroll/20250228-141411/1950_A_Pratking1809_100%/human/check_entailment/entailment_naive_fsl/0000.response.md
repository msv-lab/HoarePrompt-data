Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly identifies whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. For each test case, the program checks if the digits satisfy the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`). If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE". The logic in the program accurately implements the described behavior for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
