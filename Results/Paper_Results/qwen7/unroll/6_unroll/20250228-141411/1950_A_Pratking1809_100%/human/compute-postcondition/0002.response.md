Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line of input `(a, b, c)` in the range of `q`, the loop will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The total number of lines printed will be equal to `q`.
