Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables and objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a common practice when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `t`.
   - The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will run.

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the `range(t)` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.

Given that `t` is assigned the value of an integer input between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, we need to ensure that `t` is a valid integer within this range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a valid integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is a valid integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive**
