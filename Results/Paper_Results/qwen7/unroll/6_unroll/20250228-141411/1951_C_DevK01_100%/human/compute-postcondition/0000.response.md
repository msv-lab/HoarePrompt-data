Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.** 

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, and this value is constrained to be within the range of 1 to 10^4. All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` have not been defined or modified yet.
