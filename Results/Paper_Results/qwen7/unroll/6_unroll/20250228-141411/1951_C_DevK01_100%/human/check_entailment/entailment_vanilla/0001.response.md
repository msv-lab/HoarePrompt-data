### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, with constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased each day and the price increase mechanism.

2. **Key Points in the Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M` for each day.
   - It sorts the list of prices `M` to process the cheapest prices first.
   - It calculates how many days (`q`) are needed to buy `k` tickets, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`).
   - It then processes the first `q` days to calculate the cost of buying tickets at those prices.
   - If the number of tickets bought in the first `q-1` days plus the last day's tickets equals `k`, it calculates the cost directly.
   - Otherwise, it handles the remaining tickets by adjusting the cost calculation.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The logic of sorting the prices and processing the first `q` days is correct.
   - The cost calculation for the first `q` days is also correct.
   - The handling of the remaining tickets is correctly adjusted by considering the price increase due to the tickets bought on the previous days.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the number of tickets bought in the first `q-1` days plus the last day's tickets equals `k`.
   - It correctly adjusts the cost calculation for the remaining tickets.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The solution correctly implements the logic to minimize the cost while adhering to the constraints.
   - The code handles all the given examples and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
