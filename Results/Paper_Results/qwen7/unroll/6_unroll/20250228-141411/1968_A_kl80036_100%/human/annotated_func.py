#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: t test cases are executed, and for each test case, the output is the value of x minus 1, where 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` between 2 and 1000, subtracts 1 from `x`, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value.
