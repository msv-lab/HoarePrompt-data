Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The provided solution simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case without considering the condition \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
- Let's consider a few examples:
  - For \( x = 10 \), the solution outputs \( y = 9 \). However, \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
  - For \( x = 21 \), the solution outputs \( y = 20 \). However, \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\).
  - For \( x = 6 \), the solution outputs \( y = 5 \). However, \(\gcd(6, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6\).

In these examples, while \( x - 1 \) is indeed less than \( x \), it does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
