Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins given the constraints.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if Sasha can achieve this goal.
3. The program iterates `x` times, updating the value of `s` in each iteration. This calculation ensures that Sasha can recover from a sequence of up to `x` consecutive losses.
4. The value of `s` is calculated based on the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, which effectively simulates the recovery process after a series of losses.
5. The program then checks if Sasha's initial coins `a` are sufficient to meet or exceed the calculated `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly determines if Sasha can achieve the goal for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
