### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program and its logic. However, there are a few points that need further verification to ensure the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - The loop runs from 0 to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's verify the logic in detail:

- **Formula Analysis**:
  - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is intended to simulate Sasha's betting strategy.
  - For each iteration of the loop, `s` is updated by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.
  - This means `s` grows exponentially, which aligns with the idea of Sasha increasing his bet size after each win.

- **Example Verification**:
  - Let's check the first example:
    - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
    - The loop runs once: `s = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Since `a = 7` and `s = 3`, the condition `a >= s` is true, so the output is "Yes".
  - Let's check the second example:
    - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
    - The loop runs once: `s = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Since `a = 1` and `s = 3`, the condition `a >= s` is false, so the output is "No".

- **General Case**:
  - For any `k` and `x`, the value of `s` after `x` iterations will be significantly larger than `a` for most values of `a` and `k`.
  - The formula ensures that Sasha can potentially grow his number of coins exponentially, which aligns with the problem statement.

However, there is a potential issue with the loop initialization and the logic inside the loop. Specifically, the loop should be designed to simulate Sasha's betting strategy correctly. Let's re-evaluate the loop logic:

- **Revised Loop Logic**:
  - The loop should simulate Sasha's betting strategy where he starts with a small bet and increases it exponentially after each win.
  - The correct approach would be to calculate the total number of coins Sasha can accumulate by placing bets optimally.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the original program logic is flawed. The loop should simulate the optimal betting strategy rather than just incrementing `s` in a linear fashion.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly simulate Sasha's optimal betting strategy. The logic inside the loop needs to be revised to ensure Sasha can achieve his goal of having any number of coins.

Final: **False**
