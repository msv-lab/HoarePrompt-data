Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It checks if the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9) are met and returns appropriate messages based on the conditions. If any of the constraints are violated, it returns an error message indicating the issue. Otherwise, it returns a confirmation message that all constraints are satisfied.**
