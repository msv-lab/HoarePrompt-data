Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. After all the iterations of the loop, the value of `s` is updated based on the given formula inside the loop, and 'Yes' or 'No' is printed based on the comparison between `a` and `s`.

In each iteration of the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. The final value of `s` after all iterations will be used to determine whether to print 'Yes' or 'No'. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
