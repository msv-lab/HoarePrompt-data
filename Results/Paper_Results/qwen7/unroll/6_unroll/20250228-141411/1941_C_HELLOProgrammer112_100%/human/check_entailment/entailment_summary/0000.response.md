Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and adjusting the count based on the presence of "mapie". However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Counting 'map' and 'pie' separately**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie". But simply adding these counts together would double-count any instances where both "map" and "pie" overlap, such as in the string "mapie".

2. **Adjustment with 'mapie'**: The program subtracts twice the count of "mapie" to correct for double-counting. This adjustment is not sufficient because it still does not account for the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions. For example, in the string "mapie", removing just "pie" would make the string beautiful, but the current logic would suggest removing both "map" and "pie".

3. **Optimal Solution**: To find the minimum number of deletions, we should look for the longest overlapping part between "map" and "pie" and remove only the necessary parts to avoid double-counting and ensure the string becomes beautiful.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
