Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and then applying the formula `x + y - z` where `x` is the count of "map", `y` is the count of "pie", and `z` is the count of "mapie". However, this approach is incorrect because:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula `x + y - z` does not correctly account for the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful. Instead, it simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" and subtracts the overlap of "mapie".

2. **Overlap Handling**: The count `z` (of "mapie") is unnecessary and misleading. The goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings. Counting "mapie" does not help in determining the minimum deletions needed.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we should iterate through the string and keep track of the indices where "map" and "pie" appear. We then need to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure neither "map" nor "pie" remains in the string.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
