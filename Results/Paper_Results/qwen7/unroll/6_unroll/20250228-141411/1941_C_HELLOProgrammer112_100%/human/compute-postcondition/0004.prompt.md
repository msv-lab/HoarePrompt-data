You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length sum not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a list of results, where each result is calculated from the input values of `a` and the string `s` for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, the result is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' plus the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie', minus twice the count of occurrences of the substring 'mapie'. This process is repeated for each test case provided by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and strings `s` (consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length not exceeding 10^6). The function does not return any value but processes each test case according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
