Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum found, `segments_variants` is a list of all subarrays that have the maximum sum found during the iterations, `segments_variants` now contains `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `segments_variants` also contains `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

This means that the variable `total_max_segment` has been initialized to the list `[-1]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
