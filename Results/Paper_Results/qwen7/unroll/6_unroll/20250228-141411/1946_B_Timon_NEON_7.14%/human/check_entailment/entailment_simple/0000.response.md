Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that the maximum possible sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum `max_segment[0]` to the array `k` times.
   - The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm or similar methods, but the provided code uses a custom approach (`func_2`) which seems to be flawed.

3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - `func_2` attempts to find the maximum subarray sum, but it has issues:
     - It does not correctly handle negative subarray sums.
     - It does not properly update `max_segment` and `new_segment` in all cases.
     - The logic for updating `segments_variants` and `total_max_segment` is confusing and may not work as intended.
   - `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - Calculate the final sum as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - The example outputs suggest that the code is not functioning as intended.

Given these points, the provided code is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
