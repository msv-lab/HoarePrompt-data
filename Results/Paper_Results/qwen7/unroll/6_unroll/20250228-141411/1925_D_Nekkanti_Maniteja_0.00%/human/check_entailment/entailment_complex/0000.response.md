Reasoning:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: 
   - The code correctly calculates the modular inverse `c` of `n * (n - 1) // 2` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary because the problem involves calculating expected values and the modular inverse is used to handle division in modular arithmetic.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values (`a`)**:
   - The code correctly sums up the friendship values `f_i` for all pairs of friends. This sum is stored in variable `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value calculation seems incorrect. The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not derived from the problem statement. The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The correct approach should involve calculating the probability of choosing a pair of friends and how the expected increase in friendship value affects the overall sum.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct as per the problem statement.

Given the above points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. The expected value calculation is flawed, and the formula used does not align with the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
