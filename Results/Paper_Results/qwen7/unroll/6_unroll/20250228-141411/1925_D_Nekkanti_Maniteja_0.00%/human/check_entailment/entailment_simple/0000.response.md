Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is done using the expression `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, which is the correct way to compute the modular inverse when it exists.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and then updated with the sum of `f_i` values for all pairs of friends. This is done correctly within the loop that reads the input for each test case.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation seems to be incorrect. The formula used in the program is `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. However, the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be calculated differently. Specifically, for each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is \(1 / (n \choose 2)\), which simplifies to \(2 / n(n-1)\) since \(n \choose 2\) is \(n(n-1)/2\).

5. **Final Summation and Modulo Operation**: The final summation and modulo operation are performed correctly. The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary due to the large numbers involved.

Given these points, the program incorrectly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends and summing these expectations over all excursions.

Correctness: **False**
