Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, c is an integer calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), s is an integer initialized to 0, and a is an integer initialized to 0. After the loop executes all iterations, s is updated as \( s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \) for each iteration from 0 to k-1, and then printed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The output state remains the same in terms of variable types and constraints but with updated values of s after the loop execution.
