### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, but let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to ensure our understanding is correct.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair who are not friends remains 0 and does not change.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected value of the friendship value after \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \text{initial friendship value} \).
   - Since each pair is chosen randomly and independently, the expected value for each pair of friends is simply the product of the initial friendship value and the number of excursions.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The result needs to be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- **Reading Input:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and the friendship values for each pair of friends.

- **Calculating the Inverse:**
  - The program calculates the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is unnecessary for this problem. This step is incorrect and can be removed.

- **Summing Friendship Values:**
  - The program correctly sums the friendship values for all pairs of friends.

- **Calculating Expected Value:**
  - The program attempts to calculate the expected value using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`. However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be simply `k * a` where `a` is the sum of the friendship values for all pairs of friends.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Correct Approach:
- Calculate the sum of the friendship values for all pairs of friends.
- Multiply this sum by \( k \).
- Take the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value. The correct formula should be simply multiplying the sum of friendship values by \( k \).

**Final: False**

### Correct Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = k * a % M
        print(s)
```

This corrected program directly calculates the expected value as described and avoids unnecessary steps.
