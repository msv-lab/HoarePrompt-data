Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The key points are:
   - Each pair of friends' friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
   - The probability of choosing any pair is uniform.
   - We need to calculate the expected value and output it modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Key Calculations**:
   - The number of possible pairs of children is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - The modular inverse \( c \) is used to adjust for the uniform probability of choosing any pair.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the contribution of each pair's initial friendship value and the increase due to being chosen.

3. **Review of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It calculates the modular inverse \( c \) using \( \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^{-1} \mod M \).
   - It sums up the initial friendship values \( a \).
   - It iterates over \( k \) and calculates the expected value \( s \) as \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \).

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The formula \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \) seems to be an attempt to incorporate the expected value of each pair being chosen.
   - However, the formula might be incorrect because it doesn't fully capture the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value for each pair being chosen should be \( \frac{k}{m} \), not \( c \cdot i \cdot c \).

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the expected value calculation. The formula used in the code is likely incorrect and does not reflect the true expected value.

Correctness: **False**
