### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the solution step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Calculating the Inverse:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). However, this calculation is unnecessary for solving the problem, as we do not need the total number of possible pairs.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums up all the friendship values from the input pairs into `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program `c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. This formula does not accurately model the expected value of the sum of friendship values. 

   - The correct approach is to calculate the expected value for each pair of friends. For each pair of friends `(u, v)` with initial friendship value `f`, the expected value after `k` excursions is `k * f`. We need to sum these expected values for all pairs of friends.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `s % M`, but `s` is incorrectly calculated.

### Correct Solution Approach:
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Read `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.
   - Initialize `a` to store the sum of all friendship values.

2. **Sum Friendship Values:**
   - For each pair of friends `(u, v)` with friendship value `f`, add `f` to `a`.

3. **Calculate Expected Value:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected value after `k` excursions is `k * f`.
   - Sum these expected values for all pairs of friends.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        s = a * k
        print(s % M)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value, leading to an incorrect output. The corrected program correctly calculates the expected value by summing the expected values for all pairs of friends.

**Final: False**
