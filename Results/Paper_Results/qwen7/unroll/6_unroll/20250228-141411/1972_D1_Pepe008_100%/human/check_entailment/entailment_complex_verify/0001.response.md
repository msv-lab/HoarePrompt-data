### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given program. Let's break down the key points and verify them step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\):**
   - The original program calculates \(x = \left(\frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)\), which is not aligned with the problem requirements. This formula does not help in determining valid pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Misinterpretation of Conditions:**
   - The program attempts to check conditions related to \(\gcd(a, b)\) but does not correctly implement them. Specifically, the logic for checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is missing.

3. **Unnecessary Complexity:**
   - The current approach uses an incorrect method to count valid pairs, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Revised Program:**
   - The revised program correctly iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This is the correct approach to solving the problem.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The revised program provided in the assessment correctly solves the problem by iterating over all pairs and checking the required conditions.
