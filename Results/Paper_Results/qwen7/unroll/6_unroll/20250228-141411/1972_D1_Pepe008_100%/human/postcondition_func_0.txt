The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b` from user input, calculates a sum (`suma`) based on these values using a nested loop, and finally prints the result as `suma - 2`. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.
