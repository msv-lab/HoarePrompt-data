Based on the initial state provided:

- `den` is equal to `den` - sum(`vprod`). This means `den` has been updated by subtracting the sum of all elements in `vprod` from its current value.
- `vprod` remains unchanged.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1)
```

Since the print statement directly outputs `-1` regardless of the value of `den`, the output will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
