### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided program. Let's break down the analysis again to confirm:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Processing**: The function correctly reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - **LCM Calculation**: The function initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iteratively updates `den` using `func_1` to find the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that `den` is a multiple of all multipliers.
   - **Bet Distribution**: The function computes `vprod` as `den // r` for each multiplier `r`. This ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed among the multipliers.
   - **Validation Check**: The function checks if `den - sum(vprod)` is greater than zero. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the problem description and the function summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets. The program handles all edge cases appropriately by printing `-1` when no valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and correctness. Therefore, the final evaluation should maintain the original assessment.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
