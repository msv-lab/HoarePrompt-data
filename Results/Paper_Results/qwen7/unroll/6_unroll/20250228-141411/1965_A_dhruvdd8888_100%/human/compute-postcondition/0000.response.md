Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The value of `N` is set to the integer input provided by the user, which must be within the range 1 to 2⋅10^5.
