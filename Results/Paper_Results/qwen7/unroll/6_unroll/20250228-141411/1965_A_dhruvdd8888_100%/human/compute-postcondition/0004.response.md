Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and '0' is added to the set `nums`, `ls` is 0.**

The code initializes `ls` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, `nums`, and the set containing '0'. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
