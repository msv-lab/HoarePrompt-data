The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `N` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list of integers in ascending order and modifies each element by subtracting the cumulative sum of all previous elements. After processing, it checks the modified list to determine if there is at least one `1` present. Based on this check, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob". The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
