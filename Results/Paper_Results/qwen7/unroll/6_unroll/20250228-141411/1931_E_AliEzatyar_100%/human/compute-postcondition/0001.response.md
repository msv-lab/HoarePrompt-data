State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is len(num) - 1, `num` is a list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`, which means `i` will iterate from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`.
2. For the loop to execute, `len(num)` must be at least 1. This is because if `len(num)` is 0, the range will not generate any values, and the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `counter` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. The initial value of `i` is set to `len(num) - 1`, which is the starting point of the loop.
5. The variable `num` must be a list because the `range` function requires an iterable (like a list) to generate the sequence of numbers.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to `len(num) - 1`, `num` being a list, and `len(num)` being at least 1.
