Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer. It iterates over the string in reverse order and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program processes each test case individually.
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list and counts the number of trailing zeros for each element.
   - It sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It then checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the first half of the sorted trailing zeros (if the count is even) or the first half plus the largest remaining zero (if the count is odd) is at least \(m + 1\).
   - If the condition is met, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

Given the logic, the program correctly implements the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the optimal play assumption. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented and used within the main logic.

Correctness: **True**
