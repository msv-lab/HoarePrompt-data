Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple `(s, False)`, `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure, `s` is the starting vertex (an integer), and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing the specified number of edges.**

The code initializes a stack with a tuple containing the starting vertex `s` and a boolean value `False`. The other variables (`tree`, `s`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
