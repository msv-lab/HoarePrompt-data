Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, n, and a, and possibly b, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, n and a, b are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and between 1 and 30 (inclusive), respectively. The function returns a result based on the conditions provided for n, a, and b.**
