Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (C) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (B), but it should still be beneficial to use the promotion. Specifically, the condition `if B * 2 < C:` is incorrect because it checks if the promotion is worse than buying individually, which is the opposite of what we want. 

To fix this, the condition should be `if B * 2 > C:`. Additionally, the logic for calculating the minimum cost when A is odd needs to be adjusted. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 > C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

This corrected version ensures that the promotion is used optimally, whether A is even or odd.
