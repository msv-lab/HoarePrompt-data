### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Cleanup**:
   - The first `while` loop removes leading zeros (`0`s) from the list `a`. This ensures that the first cell with a chip is not considered as a free cell.
   - The second `while` loop removes trailing zeros from the list `a`. This ensures that the last cell with a chip is not considered as a free cell.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between Chips**:
   - The `for` loop iterates through the list `a` and counts the number of free cells (`0`s) between the chips (`1`s). This count is stored in the variable `res`.

4. **Output**:
   - The result `res` is printed for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Analysis:
- The logic for removing leading and trailing zeros is correct.
- Counting the free cells between chips is also correct.
- The overall approach to solving the problem is sound.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
