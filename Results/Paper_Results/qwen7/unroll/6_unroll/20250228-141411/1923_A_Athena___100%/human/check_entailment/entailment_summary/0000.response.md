Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The objective is to move chips to form a single block without any free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations. However, the program simply counts the number of trailing zeros after removing leading zeros. This does not ensure that the chips are moved optimally to form a single block.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program removes leading and trailing zeros but does not perform any operations to move the chips to achieve the desired configuration. Instead, it just counts the remaining zeros, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the program would output `1` because there is one trailing zero after removing the leading zero. However, the optimal solution involves moving the rightmost chip to the leftmost free cell, resulting in `1` operation.
   - For the input `6 0 1 0 0 0 0`, the program outputs `0` because there are no trailing zeros after removing the leading zero. However, the optimal solution requires moving the rightmost chip to the leftmost free cell, resulting in `1` operation.
   - For the input `5 1 0 1 0 1`, the program outputs `2` because there are two trailing zeros after removing the leading zero. However, the optimal solution involves moving the rightmost chip to the leftmost free cell twice, resulting in `2` operations.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
