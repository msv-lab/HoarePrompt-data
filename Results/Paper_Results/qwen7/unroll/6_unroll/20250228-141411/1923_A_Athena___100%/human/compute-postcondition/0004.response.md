Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the number of cells, and then n integers (either 0 or 1) indicating whether each cell is free or contains a chip. The function returns a result for each test case: if at least one cell contains a chip, it returns "at least one chip present"; otherwise, it returns an error message indicating no chips are present.**
