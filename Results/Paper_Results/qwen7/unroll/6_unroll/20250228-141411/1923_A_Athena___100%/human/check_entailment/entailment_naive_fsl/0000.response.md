Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program does not account for the necessary movements of chips to achieve this goal.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4
2
1 0
3
1 0 1
4
1 0 1 1
5
1 0 1 0 1
```

The expected output for these inputs would be:
```
1
1
1
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
0
0
0
```

This is incorrect because:
- In the first test case with input `[1, 0]`, moving the chip to the leftmost free cell requires 1 operation.
- In the second test case with input `[1, 0, 1]`, moving the rightmost chip to the leftmost free cell requires 1 operation.
- In the third test case with input `[1, 0, 1, 1]`, moving both rightmost chips to the leftmost free cell requires 1 operation.
- In the fourth test case with input `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, moving the rightmost chips to the leftmost free cells requires 2 operations.

The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
