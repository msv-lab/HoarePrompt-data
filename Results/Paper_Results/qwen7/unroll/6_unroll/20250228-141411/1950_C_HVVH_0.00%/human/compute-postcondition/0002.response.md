State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The variable `day` is set to 'AM' and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 0.
