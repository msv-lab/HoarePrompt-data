Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. Specifically:

1. The logic for determining whether it's AM or PM is flawed. For example, when `h` is 0, it should be converted to 12 AM, but the code incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' without considering that it should be 12 AM.
2. The condition `if h == 12:` should set `day` to 'PM', but the subsequent `else` block incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' again, overriding the correct value.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM' if h != 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

This corrected version ensures that the time is properly converted to 12-hour format and the AM/PM indicator is set correctly.
