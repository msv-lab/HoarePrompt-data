Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function itself.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order, decrementing by 1 each time. This means `i` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to `n-1` because the loop starts from `n-1`.
   - **Variable `n`**: Since the loop relies on `n` to determine its starting point and the number of iterations, `n` must be a positive integer as given in the problem statement.
   - **Other variables**: `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `m` are not directly involved in the loop condition and their initial states do not affect whether the loop can execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n`**.
