The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `pergunta` (a string), `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), `n` (a positive integer), and `m` (a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n). The length of `pergunta` is `n`.

Based on the given constraints, the function will check the relationship between the elements of lists `a` and `b` according to the characters in `pergunta`. Specifically, if `pergunta[i]` is '1', it checks if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`; if `pergunta[i]` is '0', it checks if `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`. The function will return `True` if all conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `pergunta`, two lists of integers `a` and `b`, and two positive integers `n` and `m`, and return `True` if the conditions specified by `pergunta` are satisfied for all indices from 0 to `n-1`, otherwise it returns `False`.
