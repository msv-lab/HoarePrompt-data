Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, n is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is only read for `n`. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `n` is set to the integer value entered by the user.
