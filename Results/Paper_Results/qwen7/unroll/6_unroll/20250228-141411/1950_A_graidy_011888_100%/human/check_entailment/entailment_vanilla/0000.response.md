### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b and b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. This is also correct according to the problem statement.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This is correct as per the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement, there are no errors in the code.

### Correctness:
**True**
