Reasoning:

The provided function `func()` correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits `a`, `b`, and `c` form a stair, a peak, or neither. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The function reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. Based on these conditions, it prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE").

Given the problem description and the example input/output, the function appears to be correctly implemented. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the code.

Therefore, the function correctly processes the input and produces the expected output according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
