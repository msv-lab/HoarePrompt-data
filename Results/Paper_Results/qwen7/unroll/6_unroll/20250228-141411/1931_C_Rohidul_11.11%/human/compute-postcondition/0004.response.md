Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then determines the maximum length of a subarray that can be obtained by removing elements from both ends of the list \( a \) such that no two adjacent elements in the subarray are equal. If no such subarray exists, it returns 0. The function prints the result for each test case.**
