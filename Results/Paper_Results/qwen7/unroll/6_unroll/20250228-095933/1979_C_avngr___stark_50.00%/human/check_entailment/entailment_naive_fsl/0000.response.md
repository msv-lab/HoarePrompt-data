Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and distributing the bets. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the GCD of the list but does not correctly handle the distribution of bets to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

Let's consider the following test case:

```
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

For this case, the program calculates `m` as \(5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 3125\). It then divides `m` by each `k_i` to get the initial list of bets `[625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`. After finding the GCD of these values, which is 625, it divides each element by 625, resulting in the list `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. However, the sum of these bets is 5, which is not strictly less than 3125. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs a valid solution when no valid solution exists.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. The current implementation fails to meet this requirement.
