#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; k_i is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `hcf` is the highest common factor (greatest common divisor) of all elements in `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each element in `numbers` starting from the second element. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) between the current value of `hcf` and the current element of `numbers`, updating `hcf` with this new GCD value. After completing all iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of all elements in the `numbers` list.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers` after iterating through each element and updating the HCF accordingly.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `numbers` and returns the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. It does this by initializing the HCF with the first element of the list and then iteratively updating the HCF by calculating the GCD between the current HCF and each subsequent element in the list.
