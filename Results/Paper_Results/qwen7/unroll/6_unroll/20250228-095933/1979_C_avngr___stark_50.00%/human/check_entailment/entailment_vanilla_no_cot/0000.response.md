Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. However, the requirement is to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Therefore, `m` should be the minimum value among the multipliers `k_i`, not their product.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find the highest common factor (HCF) of the list `c`. However, it is not necessary to use this function here. Instead, we need to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing Bets:**
   - After calculating the bets, the program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. This logic is incorrect because `hcf` is not relevant here. Instead, we should check if the total bet is less than the minimum `k_i`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_k = min(k)
    
    # Calculate the maximum possible bet for each outcome
    c = [min_k // (k[i] - 1) for i in range(n)]
    
    # Check if the total bet is less than the minimum k_i
    if sum(c) < min_k:
        print(*c)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This corrected version ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the minimum winning multiplier, thus satisfying the problem requirements.
