Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line of input (a, b, c) within the range of n, the output will be 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b and b > c, and 'NONE' otherwise. The number of lines in the output will be equal to n, and the exact content of each line will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
