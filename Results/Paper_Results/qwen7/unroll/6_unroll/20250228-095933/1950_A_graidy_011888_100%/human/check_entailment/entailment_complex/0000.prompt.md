Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line of input (a, b, c) within the range of n, the output will be 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b and b > c, and 'NONE' otherwise. The number of lines in the output will be equal to n, and the exact content of each line will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a, b, c\) forms a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). It then prints the corresponding label for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the results directly.
