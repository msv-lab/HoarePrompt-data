Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
