Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not. A template can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters, where uppercase letters enforce a different condition than lowercase letters.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`.
   - If such an index is found where both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such index exists, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, the length `n` of the strings, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Checking Correctness**:
   - `func_1` correctly checks if there is a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the result for each test case.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
