Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if for any position `i`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that there exists a valid template `t` where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the current implementation would incorrectly output "YES" because `a[0]` (which is 'a') and `b[0]` (which is 'b') are different from `c[0]` (which is 'a'), and `a[1]` (which is 'a') and `b[1]` (which is 'b') are different from `c[1]` (which is 'b'). This means both `a` and `b` could potentially match a template where all letters are the same, which is not the intended behavior.

The correct approach would involve checking for each position if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` can be the same as `c[i]` in a template, while ensuring that at least one of them differs. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i].islower() and c[i].islower() and a[i] == c[i]) or \
           (b[i].islower() and c[i].islower() and b[i] == c[i]):
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected function ensures that if either `a` or `b` has a character that matches `c` at the same position, it returns "NO", indicating that no valid template exists. Otherwise, it returns "YES".
