Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list containing 10 integers (though their values are not specified in the loop), `values` is a list where each index from 0 to 9 contains its corresponding index value (i.e., [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]), `sum_values` is a list where each index from 0 to 9 contains the cumulative sum from 0 to the current index (i.e., [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]).
