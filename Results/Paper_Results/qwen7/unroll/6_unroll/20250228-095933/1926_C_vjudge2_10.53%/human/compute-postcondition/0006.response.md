Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing t integers; `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0; `sum_values` is a list of the same length as `values`, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_values` as a list of zeros with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one. This means that the `values` list remains unchanged, and `sum_values` is now a list of zeros with the appropriate length.
