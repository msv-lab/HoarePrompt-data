Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `numbers`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer within the specified range, and `numbers` is now an empty list.
