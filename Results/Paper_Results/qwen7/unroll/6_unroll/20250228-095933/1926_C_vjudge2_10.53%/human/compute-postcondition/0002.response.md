State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, numbers is an empty list, _ is an unused variable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_`, which is used as the iterator in the `range(t)` function. However, since `_` is a dummy variable (often used when the value of the iterator is not needed), it does not affect the loop's execution condition.
2. The loop's execution depends on the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
3. The variable `numbers` is a list, and its state (being empty) does not affect the loop's ability to execute, as long as `t` is valid.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
