Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function, which requires an integer `n`. In this case, the loop runs from `0` to `9` (inclusive), so `i` will take values from `0` to `9`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by `1` each time, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The loop runs for `10` iterations, so `n` must be `10`.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`total`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Based on the above steps, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `n` should be `10`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 10**
