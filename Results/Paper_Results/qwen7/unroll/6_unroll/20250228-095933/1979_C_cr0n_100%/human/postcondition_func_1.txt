The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer \(N\) representing the size of the list, and the second line contains \(N\) space-separated integers. It then calculates a value `den` by successively applying a function `func_1` to the initial value of the first list element and each subsequent element. Afterward, it computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in the original list, truncating the division result. The function then subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and terminates without returning any value. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` joined by spaces.
