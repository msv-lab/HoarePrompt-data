Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to find a common denominator for all multipliers \(k_i\) and then distributes the coins based on this common denominator. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  5 5 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  -1
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The program will output a valid distribution of bets, which does not satisfy the condition that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each winning outcome. For example, if the program outputs `1 1 1`, the total amount of coins bet is `3`, but for each winning outcome, you would receive back `5` coins, which is not strictly greater than `3`.

Since the program does not handle the case where no valid distribution of bets exists, it fails to meet the problem requirements in general. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
