Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify the corners of the square and calculate the area. It assumes that the distance between any two points can be used to determine the side length of the square, which is incorrect. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between pairs of points and compares them. This approach does not guarantee that the distances correspond to the sides of the square. For example, it might mistakenly identify the diagonal as a side of the square.

2. **No Validation for Square Corners**: The program does not validate whether the calculated distances actually form a square. It simply prints the smaller of the two distances, which is not sufficient to determine the area of the square.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that the distances between the points form a square. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0]
                dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1]
                distances.append(dx * dx + dy * dy)
        
        # Find the unique distances
        unique_distances = set(distances)
        
        # A square has exactly two unique distances: side length and diagonal length
        if len(unique_distances) == 2:
            side_length_squared = min(unique_distances)
            area = side_length_squared
        else:
            area = None  # In case the points do not form a square
        
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the unique distances between the points are identified and correctly determines the side length of the square from these distances.
