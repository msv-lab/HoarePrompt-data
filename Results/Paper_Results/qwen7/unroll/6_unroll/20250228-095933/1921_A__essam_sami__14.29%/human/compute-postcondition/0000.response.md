Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). This integer replaces the placeholder value of `t` in the initial state, and the values of `x_i` and `y_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
