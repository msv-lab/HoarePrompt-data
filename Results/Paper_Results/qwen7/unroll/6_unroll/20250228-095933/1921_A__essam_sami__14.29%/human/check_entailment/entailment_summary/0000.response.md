Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square by finding the squared distance between two pairs of opposite corners and printing the smaller distance. However, this approach is flawed because the squared distances calculated do not necessarily correspond to the diagonals of the square. The correct method to find the side length of the square would be to identify the differences in coordinates between adjacent corners, which should be equal for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points (opposite corners) and prints the smaller of the two.
2. This does not guarantee that the smaller distance corresponds to the diagonal of the square.
3. To correctly determine the side length of the square, we need to find the differences in coordinates between adjacent corners and ensure they are equal.

Given the execution summary, the program does not correctly identify the side length of the square and instead outputs the smaller of two potentially unrelated distances.

Correctness: **False**
