Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
