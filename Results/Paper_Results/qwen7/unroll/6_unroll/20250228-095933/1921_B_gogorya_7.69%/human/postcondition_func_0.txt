The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \) indicating the current cat presence in boxes, and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \) indicating the desired cat presence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of positions where the actual and desired cat presence can differ while ensuring the total number of '1's (cats) in both strings are equal.
