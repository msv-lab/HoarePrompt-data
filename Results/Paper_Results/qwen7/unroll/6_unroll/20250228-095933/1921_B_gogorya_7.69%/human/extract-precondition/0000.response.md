Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise; the third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
