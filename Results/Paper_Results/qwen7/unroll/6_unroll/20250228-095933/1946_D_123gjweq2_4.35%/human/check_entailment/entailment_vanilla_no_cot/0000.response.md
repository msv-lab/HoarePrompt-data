Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `find_max` function does not properly handle the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Bitwise Operations**: The function should be splitting the array into segments based on the current bit position, but the logic for this is flawed.
2. **XOR and OR Operations**: The function should calculate the cumulative XOR for each segment and check if the bitwise OR of these XORs is within the limit `x`. This is not being done correctly.
3. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls to `find_max` do not correctly manage the segments and their properties.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Split the array into segments based on the current bit position.
- Calculate the cumulative XOR for each segment.
- Check if the bitwise OR of these XORs is within the limit `x`.
- Recursively determine the maximum number of segments that satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    def find_max(arr, x, bit):
        if bit == -1:
            return len(arr)
        
        new_arr = []
        xor = 0
        for i in arr:
            xor ^= i
            if xor >> bit & 1:
                new_arr.append(xor)
                xor = i
        
        if xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
        
        if x >> bit & 1:
            return max(find_max(arr, x, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
        else:
            return find_max(new_arr, x, bit - 1)
    
    if x == 0:
        return -1 if any(a != 0 for a in arr) else len(arr)
    
    return find_max(arr, x, 30)

# Example usage
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().strip().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(arr, x))
```

This corrected solution ensures that the array is split based on the current bit position, and the cumulative XORs are calculated and checked against the condition.
