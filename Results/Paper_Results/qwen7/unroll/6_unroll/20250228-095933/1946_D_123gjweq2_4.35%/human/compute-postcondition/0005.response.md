Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of integers representing a segment of the array a, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, `x` is an integer representing the favorite number, `new_arr` is an empty list, `thing1` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `thing1 = 0` initializes `thing1` to 0. This does not affect the values of `xor`, `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
