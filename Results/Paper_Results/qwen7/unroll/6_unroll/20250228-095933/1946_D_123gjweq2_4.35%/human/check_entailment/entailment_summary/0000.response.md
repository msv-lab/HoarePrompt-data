Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `find_max` together correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into \( k \) segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment is less than or equal to \( x \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an integer `x`.
   - It calls `find_max(arr, 31)` which means it starts checking from the 31st bit (since the maximum value of `x` is \(2^{30}-1\)).

3. **Function `find_max` Analysis**:
   - `find_max` recursively checks the bits of the cumulative XOR values of subarrays.
   - If the current bit position (`bit`) is -1, it returns the length of the array, indicating that all bits have been checked successfully.
   - It constructs a new array `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values under specific conditions related to the current bit.
   - Depending on the value of `x` at the current bit, it decides whether to include the current segment in the count or not.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach of starting from the highest bit (31st bit) and moving downwards ensures that the constraints are checked from the most significant bits to the least significant bits.
   - The construction of `new_arr` and the recursive calls ensure that the cumulative XOR values are correctly tracked and the maximum number of valid segments are counted.
   - The logic of returning -1 if no valid segments can be formed is correctly implemented.

Given the detailed analysis, the functions `func_1` and `find_max` together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
