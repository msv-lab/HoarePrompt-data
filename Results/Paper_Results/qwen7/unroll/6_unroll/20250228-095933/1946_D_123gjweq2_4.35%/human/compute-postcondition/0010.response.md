Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of integers representing a segment of the array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, `x` is an integer representing the favorite number, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr` up to the point where the XOR result's `bit`-th bit is 1, and `thing1` is -1.**

Explanation: The line `thing1 = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `thing1`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `xor`, `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
