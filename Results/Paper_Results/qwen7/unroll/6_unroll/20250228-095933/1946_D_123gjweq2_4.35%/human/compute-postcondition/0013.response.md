Postcondition: `xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of integers representing a segment of the array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, `x` is an integer representing the favorite number, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr` up to the point where the XOR result's `bit`-th bit is 1 if `xor >> bit & 1` is true, otherwise the `bit`-th bit of each element in `new_arr` is 0, and `thing1` is either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` where the `bit`-th bit of the value is 0.
