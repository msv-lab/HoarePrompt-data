Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Main Logic Flaw**: The main loop in the program attempts to modify the list by splitting elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and inserting them back into the list. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the resulting list will be sorted. The program only performs one pass through the list and does not ensure that the entire list can be transformed into a sorted list through repeated operations.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to check if the list is sorted. This function works correctly but is not used to transform the list. Instead, it is called after the list has been modified, which means it cannot be used to determine if the list can be sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **Missing Repeated Operations**: The program should repeatedly apply the operation until no more elements can be split or until the list is sorted. The current implementation only performs one attempt and does not continue to apply the operation until a sorted list is achieved or it is determined that sorting is impossible.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to sort the list using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
