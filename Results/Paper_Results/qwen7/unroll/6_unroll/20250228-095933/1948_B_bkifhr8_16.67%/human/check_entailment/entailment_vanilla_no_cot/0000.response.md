Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting the digits of an element when it is greater than 10 is not implemented correctly. The program does not actually perform the digit splitting operation as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply checks if an element is greater than 10 and then splits it without considering the original position of the digits.

2. **Unnecessary Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly named. It checks if the list is sorted but does not help in solving the main problem of determining if the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program should repeatedly apply the digit splitting operation until no more operations can be performed or until the array is sorted. The current implementation only performs one pass through the list and does not ensure that the array can be made sorted through multiple operations.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to implement the digit splitting operation and repeatedly apply it until no more operations can be performed, or determine if the array can be sorted. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Function to split the digits of an element if it is greater than 10
    def split_digits(arr):
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            while num >= 10:
                new_arr.append(num // 10)
                num %= 10
            new_arr.append(num)
        return new_arr

    # Apply the digit splitting operation until no more changes occur
    while True:
        prev_length = len(list1)
        list1 = split_digits(list1)
        if len(list1) == prev_length:
            break

    # Check if the resulting array is sorted
    if list1 == sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected program ensures that the digit splitting operation is applied repeatedly until no more changes occur, and then checks if the resulting array is sorted.
