Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is the same as comparing `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst`.**

This means the program checks if the original list `lst` is sorted in the same order as `sorted_lst`, and returns `True` if they are identical (i.e., `lst` is already sorted), otherwise it returns `False`.
