You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one test case. For each test case, it will first print pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` and match certain conditions, followed by any remaining single occurrences of numbers that also meet specific criteria. The exact numbers printed will depend on the input values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. After printing these pairs and singles, it may print additional pairs based on the remaining unmatched elements in the second half of the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice and meet certain conditions, followed by any remaining single occurrences of numbers that also meet specific criteria. If there are still unmatched elements in the second half of the list, it prints additional pairs based on these remaining elements. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization of Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to store the selected elements.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are used to keep track of the counts of elements in `l` and `r`.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the array `a` and counts the occurrences of each element in `l`.
   - Similarly, it iterates through the second half of the array `a` and counts the occurrences of each element in `r`.

4. **Selecting Elements for `l`:**
   - The program tries to select pairs of elements from `l` that have exactly two occurrences and prints them.
   - This ensures that the XOR of these pairs will be zero, which is a necessary condition for the XOR of `l` and `r` to be equal.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - After selecting pairs, the program checks if there are remaining elements in `l` that need to be added to make the total count of selected elements in `l` equal to `2k`.
   - These remaining elements are printed directly.

6. **Selecting Elements for `r`:**
   - The program then selects pairs of elements from `r` that have exactly two occurrences and prints them.
   - This ensures that the XOR of these pairs will be zero, which is a necessary condition for the XOR of `l` and `r` to be equal.

7. **Ensuring Equal XOR:**
   - The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal by checking the counts of elements in `l` and `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Selecting Elements:**
   - The logic for selecting elements for `l` and `r` is flawed. The program assumes that selecting pairs with exactly two occurrences will always result in the desired XOR value, but this is not necessarily true. For example, if the XOR of the first half of `a` is not zero, the program may not be able to find pairs that satisfy the condition.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The program directly prints the remaining elements without ensuring that their XOR matches the required condition. This can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Lack of XOR Calculation:**
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` to ensure they are equal. This is a critical part of the solution and should be included.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` are equal and does not handle the selection of elements properly.
