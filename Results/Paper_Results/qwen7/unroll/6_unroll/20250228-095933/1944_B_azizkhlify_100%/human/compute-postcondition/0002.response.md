Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one test case. For each test case, it will first print pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` and match certain conditions, followed by any remaining single occurrences of numbers that also meet specific criteria. The exact numbers printed will depend on the input values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`. After printing these pairs and singles, it may print additional pairs based on the remaining unmatched elements in the second half of the list `a`.
