Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input itself, which is used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor\).
   - The list `a` is a list of \(2n\) integers where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which corresponds to the value of `t`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t` such that it is a valid input (i.e., \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)).

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)**
