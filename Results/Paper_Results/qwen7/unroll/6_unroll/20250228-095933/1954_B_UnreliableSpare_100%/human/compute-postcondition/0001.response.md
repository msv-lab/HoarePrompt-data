Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5; additionally, arr is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, splits the line into individual strings, converts those strings back to integers, and stores them in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
