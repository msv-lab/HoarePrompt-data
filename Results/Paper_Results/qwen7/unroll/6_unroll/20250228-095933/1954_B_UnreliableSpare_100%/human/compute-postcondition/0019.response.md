Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. It checks if all elements in the list are identical. If they are, it prints -1. Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list and prints this value. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**
