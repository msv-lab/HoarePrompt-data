Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information about the array a based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes these inputs and returns specific information about the list `a` for each test case.
