Output State: **`val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `flag` is set to False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise `flag` is set to True, `ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity').**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `val` and `cnt`. `val` is set to the first element of the list `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. `cnt` is initialized to 0. The variable `flag` remains unchanged from its previous state, meaning it is set to False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are not equal, otherwise it is set to True. The variable `ans` remains unchanged and is still set to Decimal('Infinity').
