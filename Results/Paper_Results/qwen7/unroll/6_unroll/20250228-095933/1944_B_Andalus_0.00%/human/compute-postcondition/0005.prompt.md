You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        lft = lst[:n]
        
        rgt = lst[n:]

            if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
                rdb.append(rgt[i])
        
        sz = 0
        
        for elem in ldb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            print(elem, end=' ')
            sz += 1
        
        print()
        
        sz = 0
        
        for elem in rdb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')
                sz += 2
        
        for elem in sng:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            print(elem, end=' ')
            sz += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of pairs of elements from the left sorted part of the list followed by single elements, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed in each line. If there are repeated elements in the left sorted part, the first occurrence of the repeated element will be printed once, and subsequent occurrences will be printed as pairs until `k` elements are printed or there are no more elements to print. The same process is applied to the right sorted part, but only single elements are printed from it. Elements are taken from the sorted parts in order until `k` elements are printed per line or all elements are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It returns a value based on specific conditions involving a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋) for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
