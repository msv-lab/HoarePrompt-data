Reasoning:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1` expects a list of integers as input, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This means that `func_1` is not suitable for the problem requirements since it cannot handle a string directly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: Even if we were to modify `func_1` to handle a binary string, the logic inside the function does not account for the cost of cyclic shifts. The function simply counts the segments of consecutive 1's and adds their lengths plus one, which is not related to the problem's requirement of finding the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

3. **No Cyclic Shift Logic**: There is no implementation of the logic to perform cyclic shifts and calculate the cost of these shifts to sort the string. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, which involves more complex logic than just counting segments of 1's.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
