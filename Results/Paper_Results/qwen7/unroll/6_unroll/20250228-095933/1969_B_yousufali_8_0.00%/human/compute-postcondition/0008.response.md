Functionality: **The function accepts a list `s` of integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, and the length of the list is at least 2. It calculates and prints the sum of all segments of consecutive 1's in `s` plus the number of such segments. After processing the list, it resets the count of consecutive 1's (`n`) to 0 and outputs the final result.**
