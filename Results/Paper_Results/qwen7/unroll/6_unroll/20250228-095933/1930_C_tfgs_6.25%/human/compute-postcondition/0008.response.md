Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cnt` is n - len(a)**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. Since `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order and `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is calculated as the difference between `n` and the length of the list `a`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
