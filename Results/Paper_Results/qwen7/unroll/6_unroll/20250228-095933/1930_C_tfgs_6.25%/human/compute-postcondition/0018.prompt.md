You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by `i + 1`, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop executes all the iterations, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be updated to `a[i] + i + 1`. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all integers from `a[0]` to the smallest integer in `a` inclusive, repeated according to the conditions in the loop.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all integers from `a[0]` to the smallest integer in `a` inclusive, repeated 0 times (i.e., `ans` is an empty list).
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: []
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` with associated integers `n` and `t`. It returns either an error message if any `a_i` is less than 1 or greater than 10^9, or it processes the list based on the given constraints and returns a specific value or message according to the problem's requirements.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
