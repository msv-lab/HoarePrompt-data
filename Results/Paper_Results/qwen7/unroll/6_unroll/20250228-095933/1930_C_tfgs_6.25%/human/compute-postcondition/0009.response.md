Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cnt` is n - len(a), `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state.
