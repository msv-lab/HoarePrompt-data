Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves selecting elements from an array `a` and inserting them into a set `S` with some modifications, and then sorting `S` in descending order to form array `b`. The goal is to maximize `b` lexicographically.

2. **Key Points in the Code**:
   - The code correctly increments each element of `a` by its index plus one.
   - It then removes duplicates from `a` and sorts it in descending order.
   - The algorithm aims to construct `ans` such that it includes all integers from the maximum value in `a` down to the minimum value, ensuring each integer is included according to certain conditions.
   - If there are remaining counts needed to meet these conditions, it appends the last integer in `ans` repeatedly until `cnt` reaches zero.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The increment step ensures that each element is unique when considering the modification `a[i] + i + 1`.
   - The use of `Counter` helps in managing the frequency of each element.
   - The sorting and construction of `ans` ensure that the resulting array is maximized lexicographically.
   - The final step of appending the last integer repeatedly handles any remaining counts needed to meet the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where there might be remaining counts needed to meet the conditions by appending the last integer in `ans` repeatedly.
   - The overall logic seems to correctly follow the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
