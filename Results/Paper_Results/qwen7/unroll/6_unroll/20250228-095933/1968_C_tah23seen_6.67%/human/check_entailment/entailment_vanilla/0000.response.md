Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of size `n-1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the array `arr` and the length `n` as arguments.
   - It initializes an array `ans` of size `n` with zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring that `ans[0]` is greater than `x_2`.
   - A loop iterates from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), setting `ans[i+1]` such that `ans[i+1] % ans[i] == arr[i+1]`.
     - If `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it satisfies the condition `ans[i+1] % ans[i] == arr[i+1]`.
   - Finally, `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's check if the logic in `func_1` meets the requirements:

- **Initialization:** `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `x_2`, which is a valid starting point.
- **Loop Logic:** The loop sets each subsequent `ans[i+1]` such that `ans[i+1] % ans[i] == arr[i+1]`. This is done by incrementing `ans[i+1]` until the condition is met. This approach guarantees that the modulo condition is satisfied.
- **Final Element:** `ans[n-1] = ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]` ensures that the last element is consistent with the previous conditions.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should work correctly for the given input ranges.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
