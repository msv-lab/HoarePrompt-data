Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and ans is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The length of `arr` remains unchanged, and its elements remain the same as per the initial state. Therefore, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, while `arr` is still a list of `n-1` integers between 1 and 500.
