Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2`
- `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4`
- `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1`

However, the program generates:
```
3 5 4 9
```
Let's check if this solution works:
- `5 \bmod 3 = 2` (correct)
- `4 \bmod 5 = 4` (incorrect, should be 1)

Therefore, the program fails to produce a valid solution for this test case. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
