Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the input string `s`. After processing all test cases, it prints the count for each test case.**
