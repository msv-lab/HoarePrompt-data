Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `a`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of times the substrings "pie" or "map" appear in the string.
4. The program uses a while loop to iterate through the string with a window size of 3 characters (`a[i:i+3]`).
5. If the current 3-character substring matches either "pie" or "map", it increments `ans` and skips ahead by 3 characters (`i += 3`), effectively removing those characters from consideration in the rest of the string.
6. If the current 3-character substring does not match, it simply moves to the next character (`i += 1`).
7. After processing the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. It correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters required to eliminate the substrings "pie" or "map".

Correctness: **True**
