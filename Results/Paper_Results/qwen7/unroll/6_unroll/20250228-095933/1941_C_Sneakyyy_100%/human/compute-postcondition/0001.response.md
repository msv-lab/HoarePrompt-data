Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input strings a across all test cases.
