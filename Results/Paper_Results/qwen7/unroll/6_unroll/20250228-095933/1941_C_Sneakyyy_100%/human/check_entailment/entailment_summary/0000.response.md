Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
- However, the logic in the program is flawed because it increments the index `i` by 3 whenever it finds either "map" or "pie". This means that it skips over the next two characters after finding a match, which is incorrect.
- The correct approach would be to skip only the current character after finding a match, and continue checking the rest of the string.
- Additionally, the program should handle the case where the string might contain overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie".

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **False**
