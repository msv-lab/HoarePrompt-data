Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Processing**: For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`n`) and the string itself (`a`).
3. **Substrings Check**: It uses a sliding window approach with a loop to check for the substrings "map" and "pie". If either of these substrings is found, it increments the counter (`ans`) and skips ahead by 3 positions in the string.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. The program handles all specified constraints and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
