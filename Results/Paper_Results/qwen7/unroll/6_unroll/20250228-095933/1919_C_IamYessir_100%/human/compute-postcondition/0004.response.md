Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it divides the list into two sublists, `a` and `b`, based on certain conditions involving the last elements of these sublists. It then counts the number of increasing subsequences in both sublists combined and prints the total count.**
