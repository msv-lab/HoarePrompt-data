Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `lit`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program initializes two lists `a` and `b` to store the elements of the array `lit` that will be split into subsequences.
   - It iterates through each element of `lit` and decides whether to add it to `a` or `b` based on the following conditions:
     - If `x` (the last element of `a`) is greater than `y` (the last element of `b`), it checks which one is greater than the current element `lit[i]` and adds it accordingly.
     - If `x` equals `y`, it adds the current element to `a`.
     - If `x` is less than `y`, it checks which one is greater than the current element `lit[i]` and adds it accordingly.

3. **Calculating Penalty:**
   - After splitting the array, it calculates the penalty for both `a` and `b` by counting the number of indices `i` where `a_i < a_{i+1}` and `b_i < b_{i+1}`.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of `a` and `b`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting:**
   - The logic used to decide which list (`a` or `b`) to append the current element to is flawed. The conditions used to compare `x` and `y` with `lit[i]` do not always lead to the optimal split.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`. According to the current logic, it might incorrectly split this array into `[1]` and `[2, 3]` instead of `[1, 2]` and `[3]`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Equal Elements:**
   - When `x` equals `y`, the current logic always appends the element to `a`. However, this may not always result in the minimum penalty. For instance, in the array `[1, 1, 2]`, appending the middle `1` to `a` might not be optimal.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation part seems correct but is applied after the split, which should be done optimally.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal split of the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
