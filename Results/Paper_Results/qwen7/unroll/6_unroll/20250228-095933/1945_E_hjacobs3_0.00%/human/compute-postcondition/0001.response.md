Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The state of the `array` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it.
