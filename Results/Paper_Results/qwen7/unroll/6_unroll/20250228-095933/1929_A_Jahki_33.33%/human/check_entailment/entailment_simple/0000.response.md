### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the array. Rearranging the elements allows us to achieve this.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The annotated program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`case`).
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array and its size. This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, the function returns `True`, and the program prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed.
   - Otherwise, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Sorting and Calculation**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when they are in increasing order, which maximizes the beauty.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly counts the number of inversions (where `a[i-1] >= a[i]`). If there are no inversions, the array is sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - **Beauty Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the beauty after sorting the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already sorted, the beauty is `0`, which is correctly handled.
   - If the array has inversions, sorting it and calculating the beauty works as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the given program is correct.
