Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and the logic used to determine the maximum beauty.

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`, which means no rearrangement is needed, and the beauty is `0`. However, this is not the correct approach to finding the maximum beauty.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Beauty:**
   - The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. For example, consider the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. Sorting the array gives `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]`, and the calculated beauty is `80-54 + 90-80 + 100-90 + 43-100 = 26 + 10 + 10 - 57 = -5`. However, the correct maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the elements to `[100, 43, 54, 80, 90]`, resulting in a beauty of `43-100 + 54-43 + 80-54 + 90-80 = -57 + 11 + 26 + 10 = 57`.

To fix the program, we need to sort the array and then place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, ensuring the maximum difference between consecutive elements. Here's a corrected version:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    a.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += a[x] - a[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
