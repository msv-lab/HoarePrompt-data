Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts because `range(int(input()))` generates a sequence starting from 0.

3. **Understand the input mechanism**: The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input. This integer determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

4. **Constraints on the input**: The constraints state that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, where `t` is the value read from `int(input())`. This means the loop will run between 1 and 10^4 times.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input value `t` (which initializes `i`) is within the valid range.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

- **Initial state of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 0, we don't need to adjust `i` itself; instead, we need to ensure that the input value `t` is valid.
- **Input value `t`**: The input value `t` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4 for the loop to execute.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the valid input value `t`.
