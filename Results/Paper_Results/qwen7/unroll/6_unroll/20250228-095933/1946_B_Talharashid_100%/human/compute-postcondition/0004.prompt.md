You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        c = 0
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
                c = 0
            else:
                c += ele
                maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        
        print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the result of the expression \((2^k \times \max(c) - \max(c) + \sum(l)) \mod 1000000007\) for each test case, where \(\max(c)\) is the maximum value of \(c\) calculated during the iteration over the list \(l\), and \(\sum(l)\) is the sum of all elements in the list \(l\). This process is repeated for each test case defined by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and the total sum of `n` and `k` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function returns a value based on the specified conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
