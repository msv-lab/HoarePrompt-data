Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop, often used when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body.
   - `range(n)`: This indicates that the loop will iterate `n` times.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**: Since the loop will run `n` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `n`. The variables `t`, `day`, and `_` (the placeholder) do not affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

3. **Formulate the Final State**: The state before the loop starts is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
   - `day` is 'AM'
   - `n` is an input integer

Since the loop will execute `n` times, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
