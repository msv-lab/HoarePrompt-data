Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the hour is exactly 12. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12, it should be represented as "12:00 AM" in the 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when the hour is 12, regardless of whether it is the first half or the second half of the day. This can be seen in the test case "12:00", which should output "12:00 PM" but instead outputs "12:00 AM".

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should be changed to:

```python
if h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
elif h == 12:
    day = 'PM'
```

This ensures that the hour 12 is correctly represented as "12:00 PM" in the 12-hour format.
