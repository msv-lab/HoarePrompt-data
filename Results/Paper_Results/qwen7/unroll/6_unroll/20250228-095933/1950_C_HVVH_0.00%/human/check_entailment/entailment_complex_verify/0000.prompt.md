You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last time conversion in the loop, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop processes a series of time inputs and adjusts them to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. After all iterations, the final value of `day` will be determined by the last time conversion operation performed, and `n` will be the total number of times the loop has run. The value of `t` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop, which it is not in this case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of time inputs in 24-hour format and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It prints each converted time and the corresponding AM/PM designation. The function does not return any value but modifies the `day` variable to reflect the last conversion performed. The variable `n` keeps track of the number of time conversions executed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the hour is exactly 12. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12, it should be represented as "12:00 AM" in the 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when the hour is 12, regardless of whether it is the first half or the second half of the day. This can be seen in the test case "12:00", which should output "12:00 PM" but instead outputs "12:00 AM".

To fix this, the condition for setting `day` to 'PM' should be changed to:

```python
if h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
elif h == 12:
    day = 'PM'
```

This ensures that the hour 12 is correctly represented as "12:00 PM" in the 12-hour format.
