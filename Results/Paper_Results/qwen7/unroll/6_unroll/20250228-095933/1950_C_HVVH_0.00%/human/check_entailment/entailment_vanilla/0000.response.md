Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `day` is initialized to `'AM'`.
   - `n` is read as an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop through Test Cases**:
   - The loop runs `n` times, processing each test case.
   
3. **Reading Time Input**:
   - For each test case, the time is read as a string in the format `hh:mm`.
   - This string is split into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute), both converted to integers using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

4. **Converting 24-Hour Format to 12-Hour Format**:
   - If `h` is 0, it is set to 12 and `day` is set to `'AM'`.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted by subtracting 12 and `day` is set to `'PM'`.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, `day` is set to `'PM'`, but this check is redundant because the previous condition already covers these values.
   - If `h` is exactly 12, `day` is set to `'AM'`, which is incorrect since it should remain `'PM'`.

5. **Printing the Result**:
   - The result is printed in the format `{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}`.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for determining whether the time is in the AM or PM period is flawed. Specifically, when `h` is 12, it should remain `'PM'`, but the code incorrectly sets it to `'AM'`.

### Corrected Logic:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that:
- When `h` is 0, it should be set to 12 and `day` should be `'AM'`.
- When `h` is 12, it should remain `'PM'`.
- For other values of `h` (1 to 11), `day` should be `'PM'`.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program incorrectly handles the case when `h` is 12, setting `day` to `'AM'` instead of `'PM'`. The corrected program ensures the correct conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.

**Correctness: **False**
