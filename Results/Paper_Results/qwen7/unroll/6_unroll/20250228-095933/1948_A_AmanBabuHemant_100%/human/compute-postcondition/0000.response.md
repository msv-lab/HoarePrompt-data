Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. The variable `n` is not defined in the given code, so its initial state remains unchanged.
