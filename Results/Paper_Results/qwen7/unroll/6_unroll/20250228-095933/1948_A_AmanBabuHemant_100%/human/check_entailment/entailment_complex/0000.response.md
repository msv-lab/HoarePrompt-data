Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the input format and constraints specified in the problem statement.
- It checks if \( n \) is odd or even, which is crucial for determining whether a suitable string can be formed.
- When \( n \) is odd, it correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where each special character must have exactly one neighbor.
- When \( n \) is even, it constructs a string using 'AAB' repeated \( \frac{n}{2} \) times. This approach ensures that every 'B' in the string will be a special character, as it will have exactly one 'A' as a neighbor on either side.
- The function ensures that the constructed string does not exceed 200 characters, adhering to the problem constraints.
- The logic is sound and covers all edge cases as per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
