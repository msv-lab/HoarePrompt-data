### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If it is, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one neighbor for all characters in an odd-length string while maintaining the special character condition.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the program generates a string `s` using the pattern `'AAB'`. This pattern ensures that every character (except the first and last) has exactly one special neighbor. The string is repeated `(n // 2)` times to form the final string. This logic is sound for generating strings where each character (except the first and last) is special.

4. **String Length Check**: The program checks if the generated string `s` is less than 200 characters before printing "YES" and the string. If the string exceeds 200 characters, it prints "NO". Given that each repetition of `'AAB'` adds 3 characters, the maximum length of the string will be `3 * (n // 2)`. Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of the string will be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75` characters, which is well within the 200-character limit.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately:
   - When `n` is odd, it correctly outputs "NO".
   - When `n` is even and the generated string length is within the limit, it outputs "YES" followed by the generated string.
   - When `n` is even but the generated string length exceeds 200 characters, it correctly outputs "NO".

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
