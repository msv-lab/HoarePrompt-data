Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now equal to the initial value provided by the user. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer read from input, and nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order. The output for each iteration is the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list. After all iterations, the final output state will have t remaining as the initial value, but the output will consist of the sums of the largest two numbers from each input list provided during the iterations.
