You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and t pairs of integers. For each pair, it reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list of integers in descending order and prints the sum of the two largest numbers for each pair. After processing all test cases, it outputs the sums of the two largest numbers for each input list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.

2. **Sorting the Books:**
   - The program sorts the list of pages `nums` in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`.

3. **Choosing the Books:**
   - After sorting, the program selects the two books with the highest number of pages, which are `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.
   - It then prints the sum of these two values, which represents the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

### Correctness Check

Given the problem statement, Alice wants to maximize the total number of pages she reads by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The optimal strategy is to place the two books with the most pages in different piles.

The program correctly implements this strategy by:
- Sorting the books in descending order.
- Selecting the two books with the highest page counts (which are at indices 0 and 1 after sorting).
- Summing these two values to get the maximum possible total number of pages.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     2
     1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The sorted list is `[1, 1]`. The sum of the two largest values is `1 + 1 = 2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     2 3 3 1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: The sorted list is `[3, 3, 2, 1]`. The sum of the two largest values is `3 + 1 = 4`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     2 2 3 2 2
     ```
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The sorted list is `[3, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The sum of the two largest values is `3 + 2 = 5`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     10 3
     ```
   - Expected Output: `13`
   - Explanation: The sorted list is `[10, 3]`. The sum of the two largest values is `10 + 3 = 13`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     1 2 3
     ```
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: The sorted list is `[3, 2, 1]`. The sum of the two largest values is `3 + 2 = 5`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. Therefore, the program is correct.
