State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) ensures that `t` is non-negative but does not guarantee that it is greater than 0.
4. Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0 to execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
