Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now equal to the value it was initialized to. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer read from input, and nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order. The output for each iteration is the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, printed to the console. After all iterations, the value of t remains unchanged, but the outputs consist of the sums of the two largest numbers from each input list.
