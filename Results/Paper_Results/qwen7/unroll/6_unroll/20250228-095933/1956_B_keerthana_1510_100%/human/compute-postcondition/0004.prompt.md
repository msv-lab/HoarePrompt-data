You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times; after executing the loop, the value of t remains unchanged, and for each test case, the variable tokens is an empty list, and the printed result is 0.
    #
    #This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the number of test cases (t) remains within the given range, and for each test case, the length of the unique tokens minus the length of the split tokens results in 0 because the tokens list is always empty after processing each line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` with length `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each integer in the list is between 1 and `n` and appears at most twice. It returns information about the elements in the list based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
