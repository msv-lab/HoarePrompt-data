Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function reads from standard input and processes lines in a way that does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, it expects lines to contain space-separated integers representing the cards in your hand, but the function instead splits each line into tokens and calculates the difference between the number of unique tokens and the total number of tokens. This will always result in 0 because the tokens list is empty after processing each line.

2. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by optimally selecting cards. The function does not perform any logic related to this, such as considering the distribution of cards and the optimal strategy for maximizing your score while minimizing Nene's score.

3. **Output**: The function prints 0 for each test case, which is incorrect according to the examples provided. For instance, in the first test case, the correct output should be 1, but the function outputs 0.

Given these observations, the function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
