You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of operations), `operations` (a list of operations where each operation is a list containing the type of operation and its value), and `queries` (a list of positions for which the final array values are needed). It returns a list of integers representing the values at the specified positions in the final array after performing all the operations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function processes the operations and queries.
- **Steps**:
  1. Initializes an empty list `array`.
  2. Iterates through the operations:
     - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the `array`.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends the `array` with `x` copies of itself.
  3. For each query, it appends the `(k-1)`-th element of the `array` to the result list using modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases.
- **Steps**:
  1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Reads the values of `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the operations and stores them in a list.
     - Reads the queries and stores them in a list.
     - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
     - Prints the result.

### Analysis:

1. **Operation Processing**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations:
     - Appending a single value (`op_type == 1`).
     - Extending the array with `x` copies of itself (`op_type == 2`).

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The function uses the modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array. This is correct because the array can grow very large, and we need to find the correct element within the current size of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the cyclic nature of the array, which is crucial given the large sizes involved.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each query.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to process the operations and answer the queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
