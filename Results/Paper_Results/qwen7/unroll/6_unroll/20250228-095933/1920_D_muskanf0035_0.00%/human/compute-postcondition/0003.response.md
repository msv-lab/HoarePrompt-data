Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of operations), `q` (an integer representing the number of queries), `operations` (a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers indicating the type of operation and the value x), and `queries` (a list of integers representing the positions k for which the k-th element of the final array a needs to be determined). It returns a list of integers representing the values at the specified positions in the final array after performing all the operations.**
