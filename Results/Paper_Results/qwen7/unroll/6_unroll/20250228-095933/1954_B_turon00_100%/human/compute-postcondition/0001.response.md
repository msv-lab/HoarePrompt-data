State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at all, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, so `t` must satisfy this condition.
4. No other variables or states outside the loop head need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
