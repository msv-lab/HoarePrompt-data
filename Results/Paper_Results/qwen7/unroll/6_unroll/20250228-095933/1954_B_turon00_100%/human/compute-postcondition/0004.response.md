Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it takes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where the array a is beautiful. It returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function checks if the array `a` is beautiful and returns a result accordingly, adhering to the constraints provided.
