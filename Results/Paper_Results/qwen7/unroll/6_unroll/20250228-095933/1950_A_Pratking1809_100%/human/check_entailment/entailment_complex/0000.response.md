Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - It checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints "STAIR" if true.
   - It checks if \(a < b > c\) and prints "PEAK" if true.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".
3. **Output**: The program outputs the correct string for each test case as per the conditions specified.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` matches the requirements perfectly. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
