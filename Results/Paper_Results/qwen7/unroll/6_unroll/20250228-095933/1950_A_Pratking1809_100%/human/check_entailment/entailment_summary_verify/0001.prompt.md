You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases (determined by the integer `q`). For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints one of three strings: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', based on the relative values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIR'. If `a < b > c`, it prints 'PEAK'. Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The function `func()` takes an integer `q` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates over `q` test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()`.
4. It checks if `a < b < c`. If true, it prints 'STAIR'.
5. If the previous condition is not met, it checks if `a < b > c`. If true, it prints 'PEAK'.
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

Now, let's verify if this logic correctly implements the problem statement:

- A stair is defined as `a < b < c`.
- A peak is defined as `a < b > c`.

The given program checks these conditions correctly:
- It first checks for the stair condition (`a < b < c`).
- If that condition is not met, it checks for the peak condition (`a < b > c`).
- If neither condition is met, it correctly prints 'NONE'.

Given that the program follows the exact logic specified in the problem statement, it should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
