Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Explanation: The line `total_max_segment = [-1]` initializes a new list `total_max_segment` with the value `[-1]`. This does not affect the existing values of `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
