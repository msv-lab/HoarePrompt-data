Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1**.

The provided code snippet appends `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`. However, since `max_segment` is initially `[0, 0]` and `len(arr)` is not defined in the given context, the exact value of `len(arr) - 1` cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the operation does not change the values of `max_segment`, `new_segment`, or `max_sum`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
