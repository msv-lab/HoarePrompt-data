### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the settling pattern matches the given position \( x \) and the number \( k \) is greater than 1.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` returns all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, followed by all corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`. This function is used to find potential values of \( 2k - 2 \).

#### Program Logic Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Divisor Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) using `func_1`.
3. **Condition Checking**: It checks if the divisors satisfy the condition \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 >= x \).
4. **Output**: The program prints the number of unique valid \( k \) values found.

#### Correctness Issues:
1. **Periodicity Handling**: The program does not correctly handle the periodicity of the settling pattern. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the program should check if the given position \( x \) fits within this cycle.
2. **Divisor Condition**: The condition \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 >= x \) is not sufficient to determine the valid \( k \) values. The correct condition should be related to the periodicity of the settling pattern.
3. **Output Calculation**: The program uses a set to remove duplicates, but it does not correctly calculate the number of valid \( k \) values based on the periodicity.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case:
- Input: `n = 1000000000`, `x = 500000000`

The program calculates the divisors of \( n + x - 2 = 1499999998 \) and \( n - x = 500000000 \). However, the logic to determine the valid \( k \) values is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output of 1 instead of the expected number of valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect handling of the periodicity of the settling pattern and the flawed logic to determine the valid \( k \) values.

**Final: False**
