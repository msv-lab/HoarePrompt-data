### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions related to \( k \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     2. \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - If either condition is true, it calls `func_1` to get the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) or \( n - x \).
   - It filters these divisors to find those that satisfy \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - It removes duplicates using `set` and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Checking the Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns all divisors of \( x \), including both proper and improper divisors.
   - It ensures that the divisors are returned in a specific order (reversed order of factors).

4. **Verifying the Conditions:**
   - The conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) ensure that \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - These even numbers are used to find possible \( k \) values by checking the divisors.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where \( n \) and \( x \) might not directly give valid \( k \) values but still checks the conditions.
   - The filtering ensures that only valid \( k \) values are counted.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that the function `func_1` correctly returns all divisors of \( x \) in a specific order.
   - The main loop correctly filters the divisors to find valid \( k \) values based on the given conditions.

7. **Final Evaluation:**
   - The code correctly implements the logic to find the number of possible \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.
   - The conditions and the function `func_1` are correctly applied to filter out the valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of possible \( k \) values that fit the given constraints. The conditions and the function `func_1` are correctly applied to filter out the valid \( k \) values.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
