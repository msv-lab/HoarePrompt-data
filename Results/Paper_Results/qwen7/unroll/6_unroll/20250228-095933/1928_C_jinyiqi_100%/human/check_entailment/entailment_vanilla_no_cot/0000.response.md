Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of `x`, but the code returns them in reverse order. However, the logic in the main part of the program incorrectly uses `output2` instead of `output1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Divisor Check:**
   - The logic inside the loop where the divisors are checked and added to `output` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is incorrect because it should be checking if `s` is a valid divisor of `2 * x - 2` and then determining if it fits the criteria for `k`.

3. **Redundant Set Conversion:**
   - The conversion of `output` to a set and back to a list is unnecessary and could lead to loss of order, which is not required in this context.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n + x - 2) // 2
        if k >= x:
            output.append(k)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        k = (n - x) // 2
        if k >= x:
            output.append(k)
    print(len(set(output)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Divisor Calculation:**
  - We directly calculate the possible values of `k` from the expressions `(n + x - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`.
  - These expressions are derived from the problem statement and ensure that `k` is a valid divisor of the respective expressions.
  
- **Check Validity:**
  - We check if the calculated `k` is greater than or equal to `x` to ensure it fits the constraints.

- **Set Conversion:**
  - Converting to a set ensures that we count unique values of `k`.

This approach simplifies the logic and ensures correctness.
