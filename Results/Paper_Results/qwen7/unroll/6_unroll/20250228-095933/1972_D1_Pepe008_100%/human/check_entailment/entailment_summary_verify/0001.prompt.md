You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given formula and prints the result, which is the calculated value minus 2. The function reads the number of test cases from the input, then for each test case, it reads \(a\) and \(b\), and computes the sum based on the specified formula. If the conditions for \(a\) and \(b\) are met, it performs the computation; otherwise, it handles the error appropriately. The final output consists of the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will be used to count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - It then checks if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true. If they are, it adds 1 to `suma`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all values of `i` for the current test case, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent check are not correctly calculating the number of valid pairs.
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` needs to be checked properly.

2. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(b)\) for each test case, where \(b\) can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\). This is inefficient for large values of `b`.

3. **Logic Error:**
   - The logic for checking the conditions is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and the additional check do not correctly reflect the problem requirements.

### Correct Solution Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over possible values of `a` and `b` and check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
