### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Extraction:**
   - The program correctly reads the input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - The extraction logic is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y` respectively.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
   - It updates the count of beautiful pairs using these dictionaries.
   - The logic for updating the dictionaries and calculating the number of beautiful pairs is correct.

3. **Modulo Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `mod_x` as `-num % x` ensures that the result is non-negative.
   - This is important because the problem requires checking divisibility conditions, and a negative modulus would not satisfy these conditions.
   - The calculation of `mod_y` as `num % y` is straightforward and correct.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The count of beautiful pairs is calculated correctly by summing the counts from both dictionaries.
   - The logic ensures that for each element, it checks how many previous elements have the required modulus values to form a beautiful pair.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case correctly, as indicated by the annotated code and the expected output.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.
