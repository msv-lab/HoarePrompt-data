Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into a structured format (`test_cases` list of tuples).
2. The `func_1` function iterates through each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs according to the given conditions.
3. The logic within the function:
   - Uses modulo operations to categorize numbers based on their remainders when divided by \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Maintains two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to count occurrences of these remainders.
   - For each number in the array, it updates the counts in the dictionaries and uses these counts to calculate the total number of beautiful pairs.
4. The function correctly sums up the counts for each test case and appends them to the `results` list.
5. The output is generated by converting the `results` list to strings and joining them with newlines.

Given the detailed explanation and the logical correctness of the implementation, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
