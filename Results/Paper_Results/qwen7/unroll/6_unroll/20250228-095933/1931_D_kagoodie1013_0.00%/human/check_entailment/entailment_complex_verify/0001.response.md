### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Extraction:**
   - The program correctly reads the input from stdin and processes multiple test cases. This part is accurate.
   - It correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case. This part is also accurate.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - It initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y` respectively. This is correct.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`, and updates the count of beautiful pairs using these dictionaries. This step is also correct.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the calculation of `mod_x` and `mod_y`:
     - The line `mod_x = -num % x` is problematic because `-num % x` does not always give the correct result when `num` is negative. Specifically, `-num % x` can yield a value that is not in the range `[0, x-1]`, which is necessary for the modulus operation in the context of counting pairs.
     - The correct way to compute the modulus for positive and negative numbers is to use `(num % x + x) % x` to ensure the result is always non-negative and within the range `[0, x-1]`.

3. **Modulus Calculation:**
   - The correct way to compute the modulus for positive and negative numbers is:
     ```python
     mod_x = (num % x + x) % x
     mod_y = num % y
     ```
   - Using the incorrect modulus calculation can lead to incorrect counts of beautiful pairs, as the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will not accurately reflect the counts needed to form beautiful pairs.

4. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case correctly after processing all test cases. However, due to the incorrect modulus calculation, the output may be incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program contains a logical error in the modulus calculation, which can lead to incorrect counts of beautiful pairs. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
