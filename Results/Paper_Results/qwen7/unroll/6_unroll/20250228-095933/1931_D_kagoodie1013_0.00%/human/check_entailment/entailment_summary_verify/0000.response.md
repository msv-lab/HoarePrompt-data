### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem description and the given function summary.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) such that:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and an array \(a\). It uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders and updates the counts in the respective dictionaries. The count of beautiful pairs is derived from these dictionaries.

#### Analysis:
1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The program uses `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
   - For positive numbers, both methods are correct.
   - For negative numbers, `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect because it does not give the expected non-negative remainder. Instead, it gives a negative value, which can lead to incorrect counts.

2. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct way to calculate the remainder for negative numbers is to use `(num % x + x) % x` for `mod_x` and `num % y` for `mod_y`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program correctly increments the count of beautiful pairs using the precomputed remainders from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.

#### Example Test Case Revisited:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 -2
  1 -2 7 -4 9 -6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Explanation:
  - For the array \([1, -2, 7, -4, 9, -6]\):
    - \(a_1 = 1\): \(1 \% 5 = 1\), \(-2 \% 5 = 3\)
    - \(a_2 = -2\): \(-2 \% 5 = 3\), \(-2 \% -2 = 0\)
    - \(a_3 = 7\): \(7 \% 5 = 2\), \(7 \% -2 = 1\)
    - \(a_4 = -4\): \(-4 \% 5 = 1\), \(-4 \% -2 = 0\)
    - \(a_5 = 9\): \(9 \% 5 = 4\), \(9 \% -2 = 1\)
    - \(a_6 = -6\): \(-6 \% 5 = 4\), \(-6 \% -2 = 0\)

  - The program incorrectly counts the pairs because it uses \(-2 \% 5 = 3\) instead of \(3 \% 5 = 3\).

To fix this, we need to ensure that the remainders are always non-negative. The corrected implementation would be:
```python
mod_x = (num % x + x) % x
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program incorrectly handles negative numbers due to the use of \(-num % x\), leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
