Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the string consists of only one unique character correctly. For example, in the input "aaaaa", the program incorrectly outputs "NO", which is not aligned with the problem description. According to the problem description, if all characters in the string are the same, the program should output "YES" followed by any rearrangement of the string (e.g., "aaaaa" could be rearranged to "aaaba").
