Output State: The output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' for each input string `s` based on whether the string can be split into two halves such that one half is a rotation of the other. If it can, the program prints the rotated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Each 'YES' case will also display the rotated string.
