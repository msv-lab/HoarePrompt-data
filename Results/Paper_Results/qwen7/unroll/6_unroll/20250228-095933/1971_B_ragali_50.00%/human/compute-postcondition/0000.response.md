Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input().strip(' '))` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the code is executed. The string `s` and its properties are not affected by this code snippet.
