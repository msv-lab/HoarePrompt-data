Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; the string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the variable y is a list of n integers calculated based on the operations inside the loop, with the last element being the value of k after processing the string t from right to left.
