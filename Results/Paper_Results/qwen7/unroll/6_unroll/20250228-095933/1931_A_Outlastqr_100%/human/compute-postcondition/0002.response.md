Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, with each iteration of the loop producing a word based on the value of n as described in the loop body. After all iterations, the final value of n in each iteration will determine the corresponding word in the output, which could be one of the following forms: 'aa' followed by a letter, 'a' followed by a letter and 'z', 'aay', or a letter followed by 'zz'. The exact sequence of words depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop.
