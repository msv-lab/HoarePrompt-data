Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals, `ret` is the return value from `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `extroverts` and `universals`. The return value of this function call is assigned to the variable `ret`. The values of `introverts` and `extroverts` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `universals` also remains unchanged. The function `func_1` is called but its exact behavior (what it returns) is not specified, so we only know that `ret` holds whatever `func_1` returns.
