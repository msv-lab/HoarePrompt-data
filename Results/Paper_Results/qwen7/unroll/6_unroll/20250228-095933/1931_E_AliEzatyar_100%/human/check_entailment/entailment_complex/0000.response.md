### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where players take turns modifying a list of integers. Anna reverses the digits of an integer, and Sasha concatenates two integers. The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, and the winner is determined based on whether the remaining integer is at least \(10^m\).

2. **Key Logic in the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it calculates the total number of digits in the list and counts the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of each number.
   - It then determines if Sasha can force a win by checking if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the largest pairs of trailing zeros is at least \(m+1\).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of a number. This is done by iterating over the digits of the number in reverse and counting the zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.

4. **Game Outcome Determination**:
   - The logic to determine the winner is correct. If the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the largest pairs of trailing zeros is at least \(m+1\), Sasha can force a win. Otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly by ensuring that the sum of the largest pairs of trailing zeros is considered, and the difference is compared against \(m+1\).

6. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and prints the results for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and implementation match the problem description and the provided example. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
