You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(lst)`: This function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum. However, its logic seems flawed because it calculates the sum of subarrays incorrectly.
   - `func_2(r, l, ops)`: This function recursively constructs the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray configuration.
   - `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`: This function updates the array and appends operations to the list.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(lst)`**:
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates their sums.
   - The sum calculation `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect. It doesn't account for the MEX value properly.
   - The function returns indices `r` and `l`, but these indices are not used effectively in the subsequent functions.

4. **Analyzing `func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - This function recursively constructs the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray configuration.
   - It calls itself twice, which suggests it might be trying to build up the operations, but the logic is not clear.

5. **Analyzing `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function updates the array and appends operations to the list.
   - It sets the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the subarray.
   - The function also checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and sets it again, which is unnecessary.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:
- Incorrect logic in `func_1(lst)` for finding the optimal subarray.
- Ineffective use of the indices returned by `func_1(lst)` in subsequent functions.
- Unnecessary and incorrect operations in `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
