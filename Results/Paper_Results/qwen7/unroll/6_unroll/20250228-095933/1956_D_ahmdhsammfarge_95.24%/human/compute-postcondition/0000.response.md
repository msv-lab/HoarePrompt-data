Output State: **`r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

The code appends a new list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and `lst` remains a list of non-negative integers.
