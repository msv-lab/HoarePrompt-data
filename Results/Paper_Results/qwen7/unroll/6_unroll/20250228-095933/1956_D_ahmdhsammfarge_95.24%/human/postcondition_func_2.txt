The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It updates the list `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r + 1` to `l + 1` (inclusive) with `n` copies of `n`, where `n` is the length of the specified sublist. Additionally, it appends certain operations to the `ops` list, including the indices `r + 1` and `l + 1`, and possibly the value `0` based on the presence of zero in the sublist. The function ultimately returns the modified list `lst`.
