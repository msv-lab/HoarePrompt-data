The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r`, `l`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers where `0 <= l <= r < n`, and `ops` is a list used to store operations. If `r` equals `l`, the function appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and returns. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with `l - 1`, appending `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` each time. The function ultimately returns a list containing `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
