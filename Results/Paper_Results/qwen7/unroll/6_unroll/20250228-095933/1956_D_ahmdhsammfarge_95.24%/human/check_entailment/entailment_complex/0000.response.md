Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal indices `r` and `l` to maximize the sum of the array. However, the logic inside the function seems flawed. The nested loops and the calculation of `sm` do not align with the problem's requirement to find the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) and update the array accordingly. The current implementation calculates the sum of elements before `i` and after `j` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is not related to finding the MEX.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to generate operations but its logic is also incorrect. It recursively appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` without considering the actual MEX value or the need to update the array to the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to update the array and append operations to `ops`. However, it incorrectly handles the case where the minimum value in the sublist is 0. Instead of updating the sublist to the MEX value, it unnecessarily appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times. The logic to replace the sublist with the MEX value is also missing.

Given these issues, the functions do not correctly implement the problem's requirements. They do not find the MEX values or update the array to the desired state to maximize the sum.

Correctness: **False**
