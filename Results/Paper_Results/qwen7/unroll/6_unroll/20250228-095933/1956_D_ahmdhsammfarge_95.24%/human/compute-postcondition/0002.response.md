Output State: **`r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]`, the minimum value in the sublist `lst[l:r + 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. This means that `ops` now contains the original values of `r + 1` and `l + 1` as well as the new appended list. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
