### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its components to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the elements in the array, considering the sum of elements before `i` and after `j` plus the square of the length of the subarray.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not actually compute the MEX of any subarray.
  - The logic for selecting the subarray to maximize the sum is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX operation.
  
#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: This function seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations based on the indices returned by `func_1`.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not correctly implement the MEX operation or update the array accordingly.
  - The recursive calls do not reflect the actual application of the MEX operation.

#### Function `func_3`
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to apply the MEX operation to a subarray and update the array.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.
  - The logic for updating the array with the MEX value is incorrect.
  - The function does not handle the case where the MEX value is applied to the entire subarray.

#### Main Program Logic
- **Issues**:
  - The main program does not correctly identify the subarrays to apply the MEX operation.
  - The program does not ensure that the MEX operation is applied optimally to maximize the sum.
  - The program does not handle cases where the MEX value is zero, which is a critical part of the problem.

Given these observations, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions do not follow the problem description and do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the MEX operation and does not maximize the sum of the array elements as required by the problem description.
