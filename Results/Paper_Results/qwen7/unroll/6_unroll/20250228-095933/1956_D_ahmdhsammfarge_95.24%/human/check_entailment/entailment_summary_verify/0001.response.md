### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.

#### Function Summaries Recap
1. **`func_1(lst)`**: Finds the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
2. **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**: Recursively constructs the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray configuration.
3. **`func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**: Updates the array and appends operations to the list.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **`func_1(lst)`**:
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates their sums.
   - The sum calculation `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` is indeed incorrect. It doesn't account for the MEX value properly.
   - The function returns indices `r` and `l`, but these indices are not used effectively in the subsequent functions.

2. **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - This function recursively constructs the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray configuration.
   - It calls itself twice, which suggests it might be trying to build up the operations, but the logic is not clear.
   - The recursive approach seems to be an attempt to build the operations, but it lacks a clear base case or termination condition.

3. **`func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function updates the array and appends operations to the list.
   - It sets the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the subarray.
   - The function also checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and sets it again, which is unnecessary.

#### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly:
1. **Finding the Optimal Subarray**:
   - Identify the subarray that maximizes the sum when set to the MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - We can use a greedy approach to find the optimal subarray.

2. **Constructing Operations**:
   - Once the optimal subarray is identified, we need to set all elements in this subarray to the MEX value.
   - We can use a recursive function to construct the operations needed to achieve this.

3. **Updating the Array**:
   - Update the array and append the necessary operations to the list.

#### Revised Program
Based on the above analysis, the given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1(lst)` and the lack of clarity in `func_2(r, l, ops)` and `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the given program. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
