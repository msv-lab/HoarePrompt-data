Output State: **`r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1], 0]` or `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]`, and `ops` is updated to include `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. The conditions for updating `ops` based on the minimum value in the sublist `lst[l:r + 1]` being 0 are already handled before this line of code. Therefore, the value of `ops` is updated to include `[r + 1, r + 1]` regardless of the previous state of `ops`.
