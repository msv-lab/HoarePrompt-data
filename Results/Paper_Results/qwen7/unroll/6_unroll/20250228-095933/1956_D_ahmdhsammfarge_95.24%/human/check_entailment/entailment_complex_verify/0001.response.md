### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.

#### Function Analysis

1. **`func_1(lst)`**
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates their sums.
   - The sum calculation `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect. It doesn't account for the MEX value properly.
   - The function returns indices `r` and `l`, but these indices are not used effectively in the subsequent functions.

2. **`func_2(r, l, ops)`**
   - This function recursively constructs the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray configuration.
   - It calls itself twice, which suggests it might be trying to build up the operations, but the logic is not clear.
   - The function ultimately appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, which is redundant.

3. **`func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function updates the array and appends operations to the list.
   - It sets the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the subarray.
   - The function also checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and sets it again, which is unnecessary.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the subarray that maximizes the sum when its elements are set to the MEX value.
2. Perform the operations to set the identified subarray to the MEX value.
3. Ensure the operations are recorded and the sum is maximized.

#### Correct Solution
A correct solution would involve:
1. Finding the MEX value for different subarrays.
2. Choosing the subarray that maximizes the sum when its elements are set to the MEX value.
3. Updating the array and recording the operations.

#### Given Program Issues
- The `func_1(lst)` function is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the MEX value.
- The `func_2(r, l, ops)` function is redundant and does not effectively construct the operations.
- The `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)` function is incorrect because it unnecessarily sets the subarray to the length of the subarray.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the analysis.
