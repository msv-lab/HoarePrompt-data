Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the problem description and do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations.

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to directly address the problem of finding the optimal subarray to apply the MEX operation to. Instead, they appear to be attempting to find a way to maximize the sum by some other means, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Example Case**: Consider the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The correct approach would be to apply the MEX operation to the subarray `[1, 100, 2]` to change it to `[3, 3, 3]`, resulting in a new array `[3, 3, 3, 1]` with a sum of 10 + 1 = 105. However, the provided functions do not perform this operation correctly. For instance, `func_1` attempts to find a subarray that maximizes a certain sum, but it does not consider the MEX operation or how to apply it to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Lack of MEX Operation**: The functions do not include any logic to compute the MEX of a subarray and apply the operation to make all elements in the subarray equal to the MEX value. This is a critical part of the problem's solution.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
