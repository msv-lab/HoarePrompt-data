Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and possibly `t`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and pairs of values for `a` and `b`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.
