Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for t in range(test):`. The variables involved here are `t` and `test`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `test` is given as an input integer, and it is guaranteed to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test} \leq 1000\).
   - `t` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `test` must be greater than 0 because `range(test)` will generate numbers from 0 to `test-1`.
   - `t` will be set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `test` (it must be greater than 0) and `t` (it must be 0).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`test` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0**
