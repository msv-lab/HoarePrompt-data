Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. It initializes `s` to 1, which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can win.
4. The loop runs `x` times, updating `s` based on the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can win after `x` consecutive losses.
5. After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
6. The logic in the loop is correct for calculating the minimum number of coins required to ensure victory after `x` consecutive losses.
7. The final check and output are also correct based on the logic implemented.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
