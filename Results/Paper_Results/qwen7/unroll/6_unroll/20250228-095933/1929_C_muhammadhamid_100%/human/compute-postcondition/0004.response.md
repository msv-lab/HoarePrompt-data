Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 inputs, each consisting of integers k, x, and a. For each input, it calculates a value s starting from 1 and iteratively updates it based on the formula s += s // (k - 1) + 1 for x times. It then prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to the final value of s, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each input. The values of t, k, x, and a are checked to ensure they meet specific constraints before processing.**
