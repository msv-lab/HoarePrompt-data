Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done correctly using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are initialized correctly by reading them from the input.

3. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs `x` times, updating `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This formula is derived from the problem statement, which describes how Sasha's betting strategy evolves after a series of wins and losses.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to the final value of `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

5. **Output**: The program prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case without returning any value, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly determines whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given parameters.

Correctness: **True**
