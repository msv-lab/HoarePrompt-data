Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9. After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `a` may change based on the final value of `s` calculated in each iteration, but the values of `t`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The variable `s` is reset to 1 at the start of each iteration of the loop, and its final value determines whether 'Yes' or 'No' is printed for that iteration.
