Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `s` based on the number of consecutive losses (`x`) but does not account for the actual betting strategy needed to ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n`.

The program's logic is flawed because it assumes Sasha can always increase his bet size by a factor related to `k` and `x`, but it does not simulate the actual betting process and outcomes. For instance, the program does not handle the scenario where Sasha loses multiple times in a row and cannot place a new bet due to insufficient funds.

A correct approach would involve simulating the betting process and ensuring Sasha can recover from losing streaks by adjusting his betting strategy dynamically based on his current number of coins and the number of consecutive losses allowed. The given solution does not provide this dynamic adjustment and thus fails to meet the problem requirements in all potential cases.
