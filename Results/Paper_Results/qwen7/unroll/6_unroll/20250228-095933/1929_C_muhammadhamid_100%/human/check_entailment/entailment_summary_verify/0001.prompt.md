You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 inputs, each consisting of integers k, x, and a. For each input, it calculates a value s starting from 1 and iteratively updates it based on the formula s += s // (k - 1) + 1 for x times. It then prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to the final value of s, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each input. The values of t, k, x, and a are checked to ensure they meet specific constraints before processing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` which represent the multiplier for winning, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins respectively.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from `0` to `x-1` (inclusive), updating `s` in each iteration.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Checking Condition:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Reasoning

#### Formula Explanation
- The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins based on the given rules.
- Let's break down what this formula does:
  - `s // (k - 1)` calculates how much Sasha would gain if he wins after losing `x-1` times consecutively.
  - Adding `1` accounts for the initial bet placed after a loss.
  - This process is repeated for `x` iterations to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times consecutively and then starts winning.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Test Case:**
   - For the first test case (`2 1 7`):
     - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
     - After one loss, `s` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - After winning, `s` becomes `2 + 2 = 4`.
     - Since `7 >= 4`, the program outputs "Yes", which is correct.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - For the second test case (`2 1 1`):
     - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
     - After one loss, `s` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Since `1 < 2`, the program outputs "No", which is correct.
   - For the third test case (`2 3 15`):
     - `k = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = 15`
     - After three losses, `s` becomes `1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8`.
     - After winning, `s` becomes `8 + 8 = 16`.
     - Since `15 >= 16 - 1`, the program outputs "Yes", which is correct.

3. **General Validation:**
   - The logic in the program correctly simulates the worst-case scenario and checks if the initial amount of coins `a` can cover the calculated `s` value.
   - The formula ensures that Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times consecutively and then starting to win.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints.
