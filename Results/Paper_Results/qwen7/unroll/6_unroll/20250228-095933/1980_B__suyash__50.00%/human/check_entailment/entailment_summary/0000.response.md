Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by processing each test case individually.
2. It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, including the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, the number of removed cubes `k`, and the values shown on the cubes.
3. The program then sorts the cubes based on their values in non-increasing order and checks whether the favorite cube would be among the first `k` cubes after sorting.
4. The logic to determine if the favorite cube will be removed involves counting the occurrences of each value, sorting the unique values, and checking if the favorite value is within the first `k` positions after sorting.
5. The program correctly handles different scenarios and outputs "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" based on the conditions evaluated.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
