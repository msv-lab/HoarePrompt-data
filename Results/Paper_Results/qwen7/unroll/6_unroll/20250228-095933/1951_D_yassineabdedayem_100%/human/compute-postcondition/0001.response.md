State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed for `_`.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 1000, it must be within this range for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is within the specified range, and `_` is set to 1 (the starting value for the loop counter).
