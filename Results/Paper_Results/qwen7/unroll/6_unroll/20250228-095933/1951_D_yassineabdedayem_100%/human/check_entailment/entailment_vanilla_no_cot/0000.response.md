Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly address the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The logic in the function `func()` does not cover all scenarios correctly.
2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The current implementation fails to handle cases where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels using more than 2 stalls or when `n` is significantly larger than `k`.

### Explanation of Issues:
- **Case 1**: If `n == k`, the solution prints "YES" and 1 stall with price 1, which is correct.
- **Case 2**: If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the solution prints "YES" and 2 stalls, but this condition is too restrictive and doesn't cover all necessary cases.
- **General Case**: For other cases, the solution always prints "NO", which is incorrect because it should find a way to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels if possible.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that we can always set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels. One approach is to use a sequence of prices that allows Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels by the end.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        # Create a list of prices that ensures Alice buys exactly k jewels
        prices = []
        current_price = 1
        while k > 0:
            if n >= current_price:
                prices.append(current_price)
                n -= current_price
                k -= 1
            current_price *= 2
        
        # If we have used at most 60 stalls and k is zero, it's valid
        if len(prices) <= 60 and k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(prices))
            print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution works by setting up stalls with prices that double each time, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It checks if the number of stalls used is within the limit and if Alice ends up buying exactly `k` jewels.
