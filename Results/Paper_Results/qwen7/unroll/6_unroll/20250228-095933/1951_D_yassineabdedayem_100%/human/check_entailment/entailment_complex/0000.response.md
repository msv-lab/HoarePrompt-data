Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical flaws and inaccuracies:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for "YES" Output**: The conditions used to determine if "YES" should be printed are not sufficient to ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Specifically:
   - The condition `if n == k:` ensures Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels in one stall, but it doesn't account for the greedy behavior of Alice moving to subsequent stalls.
   - The condition `elif n + 2 > k * 2:` is also flawed. It suggests that if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, Alice can buy `k` jewels in two stalls, which is not necessarily true. This condition does not correctly simulate the greedy behavior and the possibility of buying exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls.

2. **Lack of Proper Stall Pricing**: The solution does not provide a mechanism to set the prices of the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Instead, it only checks certain conditions without ensuring the prices are set appropriately.

3. **Handling All Test Cases**: The solution does not handle all possible test cases correctly. For example, it fails to consider scenarios where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60 or where the prices need to be set in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
