Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` representing the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Promotion Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`2 * B`).
     - If `2 * B < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price. In this case, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - Otherwise, it's better to use the promotion price for pairs of yogurts.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the cost as `(A / 2) * C`. This is because you can perfectly pair all yogurts with the promotion.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is odd, the program calculates the cost as follows:
     - It buys as many pairs as possible using the promotion, which is `A // 2` pairs.
     - It then buys the remaining one yogurt at the regular price `B`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

### Detailed Example Walkthrough

Let's go through the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Here, `A = 2`, `B = 5`, and `C = 9`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 > 9`, we use the promotion price.
   - Cost = `2 * 5 = 10` (but the output is `9` in the example, indicating a potential error).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Here, `A = 3`, `B = 5`, and `C = 9`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 > 9`, we use the promotion price.
   - Cost = `1 * 9 + 1 * 5 = 14` (but the output is `14` in the example, which is correct).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `A = 3`, `B = 5`, and `C = 11`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 < 11`, we use the regular price for each yogurt.
   - Cost = `3 * 5 = 15` (which matches the example output).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Here, `A = 4`, `B = 5`, and `C = 11`.
   - Since `2 * B = 10 < 11`, we use the regular price for each yogurt.
   - Cost = `4 * 5 = 20` (which matches the example output).

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the logic and the example outputs, it appears that the program has a logical flaw in the first test case. Specifically, when `A = 2`, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `A * B` instead of using the promotion price.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `A` is even and the promotion price is cheaper than the regular price for two yogurts.
