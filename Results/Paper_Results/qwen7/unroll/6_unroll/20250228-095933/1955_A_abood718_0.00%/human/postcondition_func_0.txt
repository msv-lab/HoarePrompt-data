The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(a\) and \(b\):
- If \(2b < c\), it prints \(a \times b\).
- If \(a\) is even, it prints \(\frac{a \times c}{2}\).
- If \(a\) is odd, it first prints \(\frac{a}{2}\) (integer division), followed by \(\frac{a}{2} \times c + b\).

After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of lines, each corresponding to the output of a single test case, without returning any value.
