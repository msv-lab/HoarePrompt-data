Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Promotion Cost Calculation:**
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C:` checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price. However, this condition is not used effectively in the subsequent logic.
   - The code should use the condition to decide whether to use the promotion price or the regular price.

2. **Output of Intermediate Results:**
   - The line `print(X)` is unnecessary and incorrect. It prints an intermediate value without any context or purpose.

3. **Calculation Logic for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - For odd numbers of yogurts, the logic should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible using the promotion and then add the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost if we maximize the use of the promotion
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + max(n % 2, 0) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.
