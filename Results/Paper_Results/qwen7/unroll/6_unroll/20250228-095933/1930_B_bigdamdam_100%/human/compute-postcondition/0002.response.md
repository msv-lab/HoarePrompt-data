Output State: For each test case, the output is a list `p` of length `n`, where the elements at even indices are filled with decreasing even numbers starting from `n` down to 2, and the elements at odd indices are filled with increasing even numbers starting from 1 up to `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n+1` if `n` is even.
