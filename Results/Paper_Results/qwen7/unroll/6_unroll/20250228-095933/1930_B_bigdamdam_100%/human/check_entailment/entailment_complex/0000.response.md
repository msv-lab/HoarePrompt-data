Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyze the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution constructs the permutation \( p \) by alternating between decreasing even numbers for even indices and increasing even numbers for odd indices.
   - Specifically, for even indices, it starts from \( n \) and goes down to 2.
   - For odd indices, it starts from 1 (if \( n \) is odd) or 3 (if \( n \) is even) and goes up to \( n-1 \) or \( n+1 \) respectively.

3. **Check Validity of the Construction**:
   - Consider the construction for even indices: \( p[0], p[2], p[4], \ldots \). These are \( n, n-2, n-4, \ldots, 2 \).
   - Consider the construction for odd indices: \( p[1], p[3], p[5], \ldots \). These are \( 1, 3, 5, \ldots, n-1 \) if \( n \) is odd, or \( 3, 5, 7, \ldots, n+1 \) if \( n \) is even.
   - Since the even indices contain only even numbers and the odd indices contain only odd numbers, no even number can divide another even number, and no odd number can divide another odd number. Therefore, the condition \( p_i \mid p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \mid p_{j+1} \) cannot be satisfied within the same type of index (even or odd).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The constructed permutation satisfies the problem's requirements because it ensures that no two adjacent elements in the sequence can both divide each other due to their different parities (even and odd).

Therefore, the provided solution correctly constructs a valid permutation according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
