Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \); \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Odd and Even Indices Handling**: The code attempts to place numbers in odd and even indices separately. However, this approach does not guarantee that the divisibility condition will not hold for any pair of indices \( (i, j) \).

2. **Specific Example Analysis**:
   - Consider \( n = 4 \). The generated permutation might look like `[4, 1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1, 4]`, etc., but these permutations still contain pairs where one element divides another.
   - For instance, in the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]`, `4` divides `2`, and `1` divides `3`.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to ensure that no two elements \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) (with \( i \neq j \)) have the property that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \). A possible approach could involve generating a permutation where elements are placed in a way that avoids such divisibility conditions. One such strategy is to use a specific pattern or sequence that inherently avoids the required divisibility.

### Correct Solution Approach:
One possible correct approach involves generating a permutation where the values are placed in a manner that avoids the divisibility condition. For example, using a sequence that alternates between high and low values can help avoid such conditions.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that might work:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Shuffle the list to avoid simple patterns
        import random
        random.shuffle(p)
        
        # Ensure the permutation satisfies the condition
        valid = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if p[i] % p[i + 1] == 0 or p[i + 1] % p[i] == 0:
                valid = False
                break
        
        if not valid:
            # If not valid, try another shuffle
            while not valid:
                random.shuffle(p)
                valid = True
                for i in range(n - 1):
                    if p[i] % p[i + 1] == 0 or p[i + 1] % p[i] == 0:
                        valid = False
                        break
        
        print(*p)
```

This approach shuffles the permutation and checks if it satisfies the condition. If not, it continues shuffling until a valid permutation is found.
