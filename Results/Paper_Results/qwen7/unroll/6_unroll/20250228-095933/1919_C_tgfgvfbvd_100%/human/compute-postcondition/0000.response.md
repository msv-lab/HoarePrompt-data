Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input itself and the loop counter (which is `_` in this case, but we don't need to worry about it as it's just a placeholder).

2. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This means we need to ensure that the input is valid for the loop to execute.

3. **Constraints and Validity**: The constraints given are:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The list `a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n` contains integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop depends on the input `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range. Additionally, since the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
