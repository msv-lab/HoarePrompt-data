Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not correctly implement the optimal solution for the problem. The program uses a heuristic approach to maintain the smallest and second smallest elements, which does not guarantee the minimum penalty. The heuristic approach may miss optimal splits that could result in a lower penalty. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
