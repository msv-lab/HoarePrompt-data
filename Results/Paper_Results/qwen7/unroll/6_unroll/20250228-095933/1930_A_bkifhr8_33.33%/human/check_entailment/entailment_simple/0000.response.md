Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`.
3. However, the logic inside the loop where the actual scoring happens is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly removes elements from the list `lst` in a way that does not ensure all pairs are considered optimally.
4. The current implementation assumes that the list `lst` always has at least two elements, but this is not guaranteed when the list is being modified within the loop.
5. The program breaks out of the loop prematurely when it only has two elements left, which is not optimal for maximizing the score.
6. The program should sort the list before processing it to ensure that the smallest elements are paired together, thus maximizing the score.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum final score.

Correctness: **False**
