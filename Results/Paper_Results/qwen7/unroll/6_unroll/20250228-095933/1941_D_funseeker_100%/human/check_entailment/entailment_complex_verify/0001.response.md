### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) that read input data in a structured way.
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3` converts the result of `func_1` to a list of integers.
   - `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`. It also initializes a set `ans` containing the starting player `x`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The input reading process is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - The program correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it calculates the clockwise position `(q + r) % n`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it calculates the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n`.
   - The new positions are added to a temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, the set `ans` is updated to `temp`.
   - If the position `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` because indices wrap around in a circular manner.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints these players in sorted order.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is read and stored as the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `func_4` is called.

- **Inside `func_4`**:
  - `n`, `m`, and `x` are read and stored.
  - A set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
  - For each throw, the distance `r` and direction `c` are read.
  - Depending on the direction `c`, the new positions are calculated and added to `temp`.
  - `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing all throws.
  - If `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n`.
  - The number of possible players and their sorted positions are printed.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws. The handling of both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, including the use of `'?'`, is implemented accurately. The output matches the expected format and the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
