Output State: **The set `ans` contains the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, excluding 0, where each throw can either add or subtract a random value `r` (determined by `func_1()`) from the current player's position, wrapping around using modulo operation with `n`. The value `x` remains unchanged as it is the starting player, and `m` represents the total number of throws. The set `ans` will contain all possible positions the ball could be at after `m` throws, considering both addition and subtraction operations based on the value of `c` returned by `func_1()`.**

In this output state, the set `ans` has had the element `0` removed, while all other elements and conditions remain the same as the initial state.
