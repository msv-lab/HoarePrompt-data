Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`.**

The code `ans = {x}` initializes the set `ans` with the player `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are determined by the function `func_3()`, but the set `ans` is explicitly initialized to contain only the player `x`. The initial state of `ans` being a set initialized with `x` is preserved.
