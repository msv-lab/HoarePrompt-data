### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a single line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Calls `func_1()` and converts the result to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Calls `func_1()` and splits the result into a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Implements the main logic of the program.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - Reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - **Processing Throws**:
     - Iterates `m` times to process each throw.
     - Reads the distance `r` and direction `c` for each throw.
     - Updates the set `ans` to include the possible new positions of the ball based on the direction `c`:
       - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, the ball can move clockwise.
       - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, the ball can move counterclockwise.
     - Uses modulo operation `% n` to wrap around the circle.
   - **Adjusting the Set**:
     - Removes `0` from the set and adds `n` if `0` is present.
   - **Output**:
     - Prints the number of distinct possible positions.
     - Prints the sorted list of these positions.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary accurately describes the function's behavior, including handling both clockwise and counterclockwise throws with the `?` symbol indicating uncertainty.
   - The use of sets ensures efficient management of possible positions and avoids duplicates.
   - The final adjustments to exclude `0` and include `n` are correctly handled.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the final set of possible positions is correctly formatted and sorted.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
