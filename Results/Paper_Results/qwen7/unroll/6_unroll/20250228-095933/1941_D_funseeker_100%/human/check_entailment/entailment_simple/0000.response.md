Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are correctly defined and used to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line from standard input, `func_2` converts the string read by `func_1` into an integer, and `func_3` splits and converts the string read by `func_1` into a list of integers. These functions correctly handle the input format specified in the problem statement.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4`**:
   - The function initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates through each throw, reading the distance `r` and the direction `c` from `func_1`.
   - Depending on the direction (`'0'` for clockwise, `'1'` for counterclockwise, and `'?'` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that the set `ans` contains the correct possible positions by handling the special case when `0` is in `ans` and updating it to include `n` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of these positions.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The logic handles the constraints and edge cases correctly, such as the modulo operation to wrap around the circle, the handling of `'?'` in the direction, and the special case of `0` in the set `ans`.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement, printing the number of possible positions followed by the sorted list of these positions.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
