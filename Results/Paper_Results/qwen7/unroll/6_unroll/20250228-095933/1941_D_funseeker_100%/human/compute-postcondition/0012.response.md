Functionality: **The function processes a series of throws (determined by `func_1()` calls) among `n` players, starting from player `x`. For each throw, it updates the possible positions of the ball based on the distance `r` and direction `c` provided by `func_1()`. After `m` throws, it calculates and prints the number of distinct possible positions the ball could be in, along with these positions sorted and adjusted to exclude 0 and include `n` if 0 is present.**
