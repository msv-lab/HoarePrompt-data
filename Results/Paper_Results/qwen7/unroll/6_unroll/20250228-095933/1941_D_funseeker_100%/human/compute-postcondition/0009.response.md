Based on the initial state described:

- The set `ans` contains possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
- Each throw adds or subtracts a random value `r` determined by `func_1()`.
- The value `x` remains unchanged as the starting player.
- If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` is updated to include `n` added to the possible positions in `ans`, excluding `0`.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the set `ans`.

To determine the exact length, we need to consider two scenarios:
1. If `0` is in `ans`, then `n` is added to the possible positions in `ans`, excluding `0`.
2. If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the exact contents of `ans` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact number of elements in `ans`. However, we know that if `0` is in `ans`, the length of `ans` will increase by `n` (excluding the initial `0`).

Therefore, the output will be the length of the set `ans` after the described operations.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the set ans after the described operations)**
