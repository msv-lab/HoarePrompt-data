Output State: **The set `ans` now contains the value `n` added to the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, excluding 0. Each throw can either add or subtract a random value `r` determined by `func_1()`, and the value `x` remains unchanged as it is the starting player, and `m` represents the total number of throws.**

This means that the set `ans` has been updated to include the value `n` as one of the possible positions the ball could be at after `m` throws, while the other conditions remain the same.
