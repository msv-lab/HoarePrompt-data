### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Function Definitions and Initial Setup:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Implements the main logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of players (`n`), the number of throws (`m`), and the initial player (`x`).
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` (either '0', '1', or '?').
   - Based on the direction `c`, it updates the set `temp` with the possible new positions of the ball:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to `temp`.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, it discards `0` and adds `n` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the size of `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.

3. **Annotations and Correctness:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` is sound and handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws appropriately.
   - The handling of the `?` symbol ensures that all possible directions are considered.
   - The final adjustments to include `n` and exclude `0` are correctly implemented.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. There are no apparent bugs or logical errors in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
