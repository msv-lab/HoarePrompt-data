Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string such that 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}. It returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts two parameters `t` and `s` through its processing logic. For each test case defined by `t`, it processes a binary string `s` and returns a result based on the given constraints.
