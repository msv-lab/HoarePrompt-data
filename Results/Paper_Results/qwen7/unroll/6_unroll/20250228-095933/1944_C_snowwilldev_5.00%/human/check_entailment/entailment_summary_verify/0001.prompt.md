You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and a list of n integers a. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list a. It then determines and outputs the first index i that meets one of two conditions: either the count of i is zero, or the count of i is one and it is the second occurrence of such an index. If no such index is found, it does not output anything for that test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
- **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `a`.
  - Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it without appending it to `c`.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each element in `a` using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the elements and prints the first index `i` where either:
1. There is exactly one occurrence of `i` (`cnt[i] == 1`).
2. Two such indices have been found (`t >= 2`).
3. No occurrences of `i` are left (`cnt[i] == 0`).

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Objective**: The program does not simulate the game according to the rules. Instead, it simply counts occurrences and prints the first index meeting certain conditions, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.
2. **No Simulation of Turns**: The program does not alternate between Alice and Bob's turns as required by the game rules.
3. **No Calculation of MEX**: The program does not compute the MEX of the resulting array `c` after the game ends.
4. **No Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads only one test case at a time and does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic or calculate the optimal MEX value. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
