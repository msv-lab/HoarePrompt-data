### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Grid Representation**: It correctly reads the two strings representing the rows of the grid.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the last but one character in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is `<`. If it is, the program prints 'No', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because the last column would force the robot to move left and exit the grid.
4. **Output**: If the condition is not met, the program prints 'Yes', indicating that the robot can potentially reach the cell (2, n).

However, this logic is incomplete and incorrect for the problem statement. The program only checks one specific condition (the last but one character in the second row) without considering the entire path the robot takes through the grid.

### Correctness:

- **False**: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks one specific condition and does not account for the entire path the robot takes. The robot's movement depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows, not just the last but one character in the second row.

### Correct Solution Outline:

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a more comprehensive approach:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, a, b):
    x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
    while x <= 2 and 1 <= y <= n:
        if x == 1:
            if a[y - 1] == '<':
                y -= 1
            else:
                y += 1
        else:
            if b[y - 1] == '<':
                y -= 1
            else:
                y += 1
        if y == n:
            return True
        x = 2  # Move to the second row
    return False

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if can_reach_target(n, a, b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
