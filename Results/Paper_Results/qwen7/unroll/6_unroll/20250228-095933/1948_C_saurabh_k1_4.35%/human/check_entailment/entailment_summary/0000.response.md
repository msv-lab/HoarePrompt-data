Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program only checks the second last character of the second row's string to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This is insufficient because the robot's movement depends on both the direction of the arrows in the current cell and the direction of the arrows in the cells it moves to.

Here's why the provided solution is incorrect:
- The program only checks if `b[n - 2]` is '<', which means it only considers the direction of the arrow in the second last column of the second row.
- If `b[n - 2]` is '<', it incorrectly concludes that the robot cannot reach (2, n).
- If `b[n - 2]` is '>', it incorrectly concludes that the robot can reach (2, n).

However, the robot's ability to reach (2, n) depends on the entire path from (1, 1) to (2, n). The robot must navigate through the grid according to the directions of the arrows in both rows.

Therefore, the program fails to account for the complex path the robot must take to reach (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
