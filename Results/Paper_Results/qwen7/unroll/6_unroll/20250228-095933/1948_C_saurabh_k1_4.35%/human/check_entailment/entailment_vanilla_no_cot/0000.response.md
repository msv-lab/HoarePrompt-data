Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the second-to-last column's arrow direction in the second row to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This logic is insufficient and does not account for the robot's movement pattern across the entire grid.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the robot's path through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()  # First row of arrows
        b = input()  # Second row of arrows
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
        
        while True:
            # Move down to the next row
            x += 1
            
            # Check if we have reached the target cell (2, n)
            if x == 2 and y == n:
                print('YES')
                break
            
            # Move according to the arrow in the current cell
            if a[y-1] == '<':
                y -= 1
            elif a[y-1] == '>':
                y += 1
            elif b[y-1] == '<':
                y -= 1
            elif b[y-1] == '>':
                y += 1
            
            # If we exit the grid, the robot cannot reach (2, n)
            if y < 1 or y > n:
                print('NO')
                break

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program simulates the robot's movement step-by-step, checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in both rows.
