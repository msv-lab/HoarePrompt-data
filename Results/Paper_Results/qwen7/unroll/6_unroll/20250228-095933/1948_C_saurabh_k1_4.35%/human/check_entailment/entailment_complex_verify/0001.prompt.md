You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>' representing the direction of the arrow in the corresponding cell of the grid.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>' representing the direction of the arrow in the corresponding cell of the grid; after executing all iterations of the loop, for each test case, if the second last character of the second string is '<', the output will be 'No', otherwise the output will be 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), containing only '<' or '>' characters. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is '<'. If true, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`.
   - It then reads two strings representing the two rows of the grid.

2. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks the character at position `n - 2` in the second row (`b`).
   - If this character is `<`, it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Problem Understanding

- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and needs to reach `(2, n)`.
- The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but only moves according to the arrow in the current cell.
- The condition `if b[n - 2] == '<'` seems to check if the last column in the second row has an arrow pointing left.
- However, this condition alone does not account for the entire path the robot must take to reach `(2, n)`.

### Example Analysis

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
   - The condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` checks `b[2]` which is `>` (not `<`). So, it prints 'Yes', which is correct.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     ><
     ><
     ```
   - The condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` checks `b[1]` which is `>` (not `<`). So, it prints 'Yes', which is correct.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >>><
     >><<
     ```
   - The condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` checks `b[3]` which is `<`. So, it prints 'No', which is incorrect because the robot can still reach `(2, 4)`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >><<><
     ><>>><
     ```
   - The condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` checks `b[5]` which is `>` (not `<`). So, it prints 'Yes', which is correct.

### Conclusion

The condition `if b[n - 2] == '<'` is too restrictive and does not account for all possible paths the robot can take to reach `(2, n)`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
