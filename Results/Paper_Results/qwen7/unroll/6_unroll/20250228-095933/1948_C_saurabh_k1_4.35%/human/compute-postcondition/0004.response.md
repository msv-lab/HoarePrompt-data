Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), containing only '<' or '>' characters. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is '<'. If true, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
