State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the dummy variable `_`.
- The value of `_` is not relevant since it is a dummy variable used for iteration.
- The value of `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is within the specified range.
