You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the array a consists of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

        print(max)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For each value of t, there is a corresponding value of n (an integer), and a list a of integers. After executing the loop, for each n:
    #- If n is 2, the output is the minimum value in list a.
    #- If n is greater than 2, the output is the second largest value among all possible triplets in list a when considering the first two elements of each triplet.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the maximum possible value that the entire array can be reduced to using the given operations.
- **Operations**: 
  1. Choose indices \( l \) and \( r \) such that \( 1 \leq l < r \leq n \).
  2. Compute the median of the subarray \( [a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r] \).
  3. Set all values \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r \) to the computed median.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is read as the length of the array.
   - The array `a` is read and stored.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints the minimum value of the array and continues to the next test case. This is because for two elements, the only way to make them equal is to set both to the minimum value.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - A variable `max` is initialized to 0.
   - The program iterates through the array with a loop from `i = 0` to `n - 3`.
   - For each `i`, it considers a subarray of length 3 starting at index `i` and ending at `i + 2`.
   - It sorts this subarray and checks if the middle element (second element in the sorted subarray) is greater than the current `max`. If so, it updates `max`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Subarray Length Consideration**:
   - The program only considers subarrays of length 3. However, the problem allows choosing any subarray of length 2 to \( n \). This means the program might miss out on potentially larger medians from longer subarrays.

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median is correctly calculated as the middle element of a sorted subarray of length 3. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the global maximum median across all possible subarrays.

3. **Global Maximum Median**:
   - The program does not ensure that the maximum median found is the global maximum median for the entire array. It only considers subarrays of length 3.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum possible value that the entire array can be reduced to using the given operations. It only considers subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to find the global maximum median.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program needs to consider all possible subarrays to ensure it finds the maximum possible value that the entire array can be reduced to.
