Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For each value of t, there is a corresponding value of n (an integer), and a list a of integers. After executing the loop, for each n:
- If n is 2, the output is the minimum value from the list a.
- Otherwise, the output is the second largest value among all possible triplets in the list a when considering consecutive elements.
