Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, after the loop executes all iterations, s is an integer calculated as \(s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\right) \mod M\), where \(c = \left(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\right)^{-1} \mod M\) and M is \(10^9 + 7\). The values of a_i, b_i, and f_i remain unchanged from their initial states.
