### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
- The friendship value of a non-friend pair remains 0.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)  # Modular inverse of (n * (n - 1) / 2) modulo 10^9 + 7
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Key Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)`. This is a correct step, but it is used incorrectly later.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: The program adds `c * i * c * m` and `c * a` in each iteration of the loop, which does not correctly model the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the probability of selecting each pair.
2. For each pair, calculate the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions.
3. Sum these expected values to get the final result.

The correct expected value for each pair of friends can be derived as follows:
- The probability of selecting a specific pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1))`.
- The expected increase in friendship value for a specific pair over k excursions is `k * (1 / (n * (n - 1)))`.

Summing these expected values for all pairs gives the final expected value.

#### Correct Solution Outline:
1. Calculate the total number of unique pairs: `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
2. Calculate the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs.
3. For each pair of friends, calculate the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions.
4. Sum these expected values and print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. It incorrectly adds a constant value `c * a` and uses the modular inverse in a way that does not reflect the expected value calculation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
