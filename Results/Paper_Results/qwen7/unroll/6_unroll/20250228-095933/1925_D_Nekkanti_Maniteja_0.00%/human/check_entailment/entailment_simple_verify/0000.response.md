### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen.
- The friendship value of a non-friend pair remains 0.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: This sets the modulus for the final output.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`: This calculates the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - `a = 0`: Initializes the sum of friendship values.
   - The loop `for i in range(m):` reads the friendship values and sums them into `a`.

3. **Main Calculation Loop**:
   - `for i in range(k):`: This loop iterates k times.
   - `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`: This updates the sum `s` using a formula that doesn't correctly model the expected value.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve this problem, we need to use the concept of expected value.
- For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any single excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The expected number of times a pair is chosen in k excursions is \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- Since the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen, the expected increase in friendship value for each pair is \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
- The total expected value is the sum of these expected increases for all pairs.

Given the provided program, it does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it uses a fixed formula that does not account for the probability and expected value calculations.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The formula used in the program does not reflect the proper expected value calculation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
