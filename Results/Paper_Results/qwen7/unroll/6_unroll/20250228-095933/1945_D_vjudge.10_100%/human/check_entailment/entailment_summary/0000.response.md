Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes `pergunta` to infinity and sets up the necessary variables.
2. The loop iterates backward through the arrays `a` and `b` from index `n-1` to `0`.
3. For each iteration, it checks if the current index `i` is less than `m`. If true, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`.
4. It also updates `x` to be the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
5. After the loop, it prints the value of `pergunta`.

Given the logic described in the problem and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct approach to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. The logic of updating `pergunta` and `x` seems appropriate for the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
