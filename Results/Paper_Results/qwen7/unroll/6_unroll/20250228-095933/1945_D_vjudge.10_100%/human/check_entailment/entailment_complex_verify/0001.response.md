### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components and logic of the program. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step to ensure the correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` of size `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `pergunta` to infinity, ensuring that any valid cost will be smaller.
   - The variable `x` accumulates the cost of moving through the queue.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `i < m`. If true, it updates `pergunta` with the minimum cost of moving to position `i`.
   - The variable `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum cost.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly accounts for the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` people.
- The backward iteration ensures that the cost of moving through the queue is calculated correctly.
- The initialization of `pergunta` to infinity ensures that the minimum cost is found.
- The condition `i < m` correctly identifies the positions where Kirill should stop moving.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Initialization:** `pergunta` is set to infinity, ensuring that the minimum cost is found.
- **Backward Iteration:** The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`, allowing the program to consider the cost of moving backwards.
- **Cost Calculation:** The cost is accumulated using `x`, and the minimum cost is updated when `i < m`.
- **Condition Check:** The condition `i < m` ensures that Kirill stops moving once he reaches the desired position.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no logical errors or misinterpretations in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
