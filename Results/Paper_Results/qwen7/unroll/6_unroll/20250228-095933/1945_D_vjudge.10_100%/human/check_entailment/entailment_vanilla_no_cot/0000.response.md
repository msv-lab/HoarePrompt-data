Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Dynamic Calculation**: The function `func_1` iterates from the last person to the first person in the queue. For each person, it calculates the cost of moving Kirill to that position and updates the minimum cost accordingly.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost includes both the direct payment to the current person (`a[i]`) and the cumulative payment for all intermediate positions (`b[i]`).
4. **Boundary Condition**: The program ensures that Kirill's final position is within the allowed limit (`m`).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
