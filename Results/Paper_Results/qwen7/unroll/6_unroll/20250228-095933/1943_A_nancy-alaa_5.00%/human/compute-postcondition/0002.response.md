Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, if there is an index i that does not appear in the array, it prints i and breaks. If there is exactly one occurrence of each index from 0 to i-1 and i has already appeared once before, it prints i and breaks. Otherwise, it continues to the next index.
