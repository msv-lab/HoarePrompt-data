You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list a contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        v = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for _ in range(n):
            x = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            v[x] += 1
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if v[i] >= 2:
                ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
            if v[i] >= 3:
                ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
            cnt += v[i]
        
        results.append(str(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing the calculated answers for each iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: what is printed (where the printed content is the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list a containing n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
