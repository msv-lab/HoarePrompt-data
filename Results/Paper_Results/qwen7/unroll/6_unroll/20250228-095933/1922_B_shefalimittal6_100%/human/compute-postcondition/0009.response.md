Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx` is explicitly given as 6.
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`. Since `data` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`, but we know it is the integer value of the first element of `data`.
- `results` is a list containing the calculated answers for each iteration. However, the exact content of `results` is not provided, so we cannot determine its precise contents.

Given this information, the `print` statement will join the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Therefore, the output will be a string where each element of the `results` list is printed on a new line.

Output: **what is printed (where the printed content is the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line)**
