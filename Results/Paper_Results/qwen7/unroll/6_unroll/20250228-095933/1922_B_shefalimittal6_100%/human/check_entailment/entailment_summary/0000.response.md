Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified, handling multiple test cases.
2. It processes each test case by reading the number of sticks `n` and their corresponding values `a_i`.
3. It counts the occurrences of each unique value in the list `a`.
4. The logic to count the number of ways to form a triangle is correct:
   - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same length `i`, it calculates the combinations of choosing 2 out of those sticks and pairs them with any other stick.
   - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same length `i`, it calculates the combinations of choosing 3 out of those sticks.
5. The final result is computed correctly and printed for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should produce the correct output based on the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
