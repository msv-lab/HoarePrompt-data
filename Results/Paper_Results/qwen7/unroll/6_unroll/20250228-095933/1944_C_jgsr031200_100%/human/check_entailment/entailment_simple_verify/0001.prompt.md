You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to her array `c`, and delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - If there are at least two unique elements in `a`, Alice can always ensure that the MEX is at least 2 by picking two different elements and appending them to `c` in her first two turns.
   - If there is only one unique element in `a`, the MEX will be 0 because `c` will contain only that element.
   - If there are no repeated elements, the MEX will be determined by the smallest missing number in `c`.

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic.
   - It attempts to use functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not relevant to the problem.
   - The `func_1` function is intended to calculate the MEX, but it does not correctly simulate the game turns and does not account for the optimal strategy.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To solve this, we need to count the frequency of each element in `a`.
   - If there are at least two unique elements, Alice can ensure the MEX is at least 2.
   - If there is only one unique element, the MEX will be 0.
   - If there are no repeated elements, the MEX will be determined by the smallest missing number in `c`.

### Correct Solution:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count frequency of each element
    freq = [0] * n
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    # Determine the MEX
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            mex = i
            break
    
    # If all elements are used, MEX is n
    if mex == 0 and all(freq[i] > 0 for i in range(n)):
        mex = n
    
    print(mex)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX value. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
