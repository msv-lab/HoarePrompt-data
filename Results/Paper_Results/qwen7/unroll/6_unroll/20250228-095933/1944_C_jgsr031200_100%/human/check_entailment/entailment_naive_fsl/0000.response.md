Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the calculation of the MEX value. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply counts the frequency of each number in the array and prints the first number that appears exactly once or twice, which is not the correct approach for determining the MEX value after both players have played optimally.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output is:

```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will not produce these results because it does not simulate the game turns and calculate the MEX value correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
