You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed based on the conditions given in the loop. For each test case, if \( k < 4n - 3 \), the output is \((k // 2 + k \% 2)\). If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the output is \(2n\). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), the output is also \(2n\).
    #
    #This means the output will vary depending on the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case, but it will always follow one of these three rules.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the conditions: if \( k < 4n - 3 \), it prints \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \); if \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n \); and if \( k = 4n - 2 \), it also prints \( 2n \). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated values for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses a conditional expression to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of \( k \).

3. **Breaking Down the Conditional Expression:**
   - `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: 
     - This part calculates the minimum number of cells needed when \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \).
     - `k // 2 + k % 2` gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( k / 2 \).
     - If \( k < 4n - 3 \), it returns this value.
   - `+ 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: 
     - This part handles the case where \( k \geq 4n - 3 \).
     - If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), it returns \( 2n \), meaning all cells in one row or column need to be colored.
   - `+ (k == 4 * n - 2)`: 
     - This ensures that if \( k = 4n - 2 \), the exact number of cells required is \( 2n \).

4. **Testing the Logic:**
   - For small values of \( k \) (less than \( 4n - 3 \)), the logic correctly calculates the minimum number of cells.
   - For larger values of \( k \) (equal to or greater than \( 4n - 3 \)), the logic also correctly calculates the minimum number of cells.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly by returning \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The given solution appears to correctly handle all cases based on the problem statement and examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
