Output: **Bob**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `cw` is False and `cw` is not True. This means both conditions are consistent with each other. The `print('Bob')` statement simply prints the string 'Bob'. There are no variables or objects within the print statement itself that need further elaboration since it directly prints the string as given.
