Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers where each element was originally a string in the set `nums`, and '0' is included; `ls` is 0**.

The code initializes `ls` to 0. Since `nums` was already defined as a sorted list of integers (originally strings), its state remains unchanged. The only new information is that `ls` is now 0.
