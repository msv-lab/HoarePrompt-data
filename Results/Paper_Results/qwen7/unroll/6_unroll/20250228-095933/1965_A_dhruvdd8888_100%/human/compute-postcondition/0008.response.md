Output State: **`nw` is True, `nums` is a list of integers where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `nums`; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.**

Explanation: The variable `nw` is set to `True`, which changes its state. The lists `nums` and `ls` remain unchanged from their initial state, where `nums` is a list of integers that have been modified by decrementing each element by the cumulative sum of all previous elements, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`.
