Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being `len(nums) - 2`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `len(nums) - 2` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Hence, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the Expression `len(nums) - 2`**: This expression determines the initial value of `i`. Since the loop starts with `i = len(nums) - 2`, this value must be valid for the loop to begin.

5. **Adjust the State of `nums` and `ls`**: The state of `nums` and `ls` does not directly affect the loop condition. However, they provide context about the initial setup of the list and its sum. These values do not need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute, but they should reflect the given initial conditions.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `i` should be set to `len(nums) - 2`.
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`cw` is True, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
