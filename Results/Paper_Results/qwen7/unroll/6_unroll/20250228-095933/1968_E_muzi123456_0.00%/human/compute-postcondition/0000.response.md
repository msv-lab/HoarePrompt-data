Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `n` is undefined.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the input for `t` is specified to be a positive integer between 1 and 50, that is the updated state for `t`. The variable `n` is not defined or affected by this code snippet, so it remains undefined.
