### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - If `k == n`, it constructs an array where all elements are `1`. This is valid because all cyclic shifts of `[1, 1, ..., 1]` are sorted.
   - If `k == 1`, it constructs an array with elements ranging from `0` to `n-1`. This ensures only one cyclic shift is sorted (the original array).
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid array exists for the given `n` and `k`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the constructed array or `-1` for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly handles all specified cases:
- It outputs the correct arrays when `k == n` or `k == 1`.
- It correctly outputs `-1` when no valid array can be constructed.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
