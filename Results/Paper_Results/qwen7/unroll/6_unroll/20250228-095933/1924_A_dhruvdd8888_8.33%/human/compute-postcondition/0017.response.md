Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k, an integer m, and a string s of length m comprising the first k lowercase English alphabets. It checks if the string s can be partitioned into substrings such that each substring contains exactly k distinct characters. If at least n such substrings can be found, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a specific string based on the remaining characters.**
