You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k, an integer m, and a string s of length m comprising the first k lowercase English alphabets. It checks if the string s can be partitioned into substrings such that each substring contains exactly k distinct characters. If at least n such substrings can be found, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a specific string based on the remaining characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` and a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Generating Possible Characters:**
   - It generates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the longest sequence of unique characters from the first `k` alphabets within the string `s`.
   - It maintains a set `win` to keep track of the characters seen so far.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if the current character is in `us`. If it is, it adds the character to `win` and clears `win` once `k` unique characters are found.
   - It keeps track of the number of times such a sequence is found (`ps`).

4. **Checking if All Combinations are Found:**
   - After processing the string, it checks if `ps` (the number of times a sequence of `k` unique characters was found) is at least `n`.
   - If yes, it prints "YES".
   - If no, it prints "NO" and then constructs a string of length `n` that does not form a subsequence of `s` by using the first character from `us` that was not part of the last sequence found.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding All Combinations:**
   - The program only checks for sequences of `k` unique characters but does not ensure that all combinations of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are present.
   - The logic for constructing the string that is not a subsequence is flawed because it only considers the first character of the missing sequence, which might not always be correct.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be revised to properly check all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and ensure they are subsequences of `s`.
