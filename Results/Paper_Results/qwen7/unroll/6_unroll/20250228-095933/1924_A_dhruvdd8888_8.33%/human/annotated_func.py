#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing some of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the content of `s`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character is added when `win` contains exactly `k` elements, `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `ans` was appended, which is also the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` elements, and `ps` equals `n`.
    #
    #In this output state, the loop has executed all its iterations, and `ps` is set to `n`, indicating that `ans` has been appended `n` times, each time `win` contained exactly `k` elements. The value of `ans` will be a concatenation of all characters from `win` that were added during these `n` iterations, followed by 'a' repeated `n-1` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k, an integer m, and a string s of length m comprising the first k lowercase English alphabets. It checks if the string s can be partitioned into substrings such that each substring contains exactly k distinct characters. If at least n such substrings can be found, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a specific string based on the remaining characters.
