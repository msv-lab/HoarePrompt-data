You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set initially empty but potentially contains some of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the content of `s`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character is added when `win` contains exactly `k` elements, `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `ans` was appended, which is also the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` elements.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES'
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing some of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the content of `s`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character is added when `win` contains exactly `k` elements, `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `ans` was appended, which is also the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` elements, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is a set containing some of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the content of `s`, `ans` is a list of characters where each character is added when `win` contains exactly `k` elements, `ps` is an integer representing the number of times `ans` was appended, which is also the number of times `win` contained exactly `k` elements, and `ps` equals `n`.
    #
    #In this output state, the loop has executed all its iterations, and `ps` is set to `n`, indicating that `ans` has been appended `n` times, each time `win` contained exactly `k` elements. The value of `ans` will be a concatenation of all characters from `win` that were added during these `n` iterations, followed by 'a' repeated `n-1` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an input consisting of an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes integers n and k (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), an integer m (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and a string s of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, if a certain condition is met, the function prints 'YES'.

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES'
