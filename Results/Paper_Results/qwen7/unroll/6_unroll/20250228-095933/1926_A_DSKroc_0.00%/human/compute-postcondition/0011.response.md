Functionality: **The function processes up to 32 input strings, each of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. It counts the total number of 'A's and 'B's across all strings. Based on whether the count of 'A's is greater than the count of 'B's, it prints 'A' or 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**
