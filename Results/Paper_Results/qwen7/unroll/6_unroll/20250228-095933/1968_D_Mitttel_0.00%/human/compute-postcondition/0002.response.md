Output State: **`steps` is 0, `score` is 0, `start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position (either P_B or P_S), `current_pos` is `start_pos`, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ start_pos ≤ n and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array a.**

The code initializes the variable `steps` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `steps` and retains the initial values and states of all other variables.
