Output State: **`steps` is 0, `score` is 0, `start_pos` is an integer representing the starting position (either P_B or P_S), `current_pos` is `start_pos`, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `start_pos` ≤ `n` and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array `a`; a new dictionary `visited` is created but is empty; `cycle_start` is -1.**

The variable `cycle_start` is assigned the value `-1`. All other variables retain their initial states.
