Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `steps < k`. Therefore, the only variable involved in the loop head is `steps`.

2. **Determine the current state of `steps`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `steps` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute at least once**: For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `steps < k` must be true. Given that `steps` is currently 0, this condition will be true as long as `k` is greater than 0.

4. **Check if any other states need adjustment**: Since the only variable in the loop head is `steps`, and it is already set to 0, no other states need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `steps` being 0, and for the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`steps` is 0, `k` must be a positive integer**
