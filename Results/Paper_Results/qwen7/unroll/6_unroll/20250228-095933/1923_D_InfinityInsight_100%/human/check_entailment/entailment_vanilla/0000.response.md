Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function is used to find the position of the smallest element greater than or equal to `x` in the list `a`. It uses binary search via `bisect_left`.

```python
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx
```

- This function is correct. It returns the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If such an element does not exist, it returns `-1`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function aims to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.

```python
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans
```

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` is initialized with `[0]` to store cumulative sums.
   - `last` is initialized with `[-1]` to keep track of the last index where the value was different from the current one.
   - `ans` is initialized with `[-1] * n` to store the result for each slime.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - For each element in `a`, we append the cumulative sum to `left`.

3. **Finding the Nearest Smaller Slime:**
   - For each slime at index `i`, if it is smaller than the previous one (`a[i] < a[i - 1]`), it will be eaten immediately, so `ans[i] = 1`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, which represents the sum of sizes of all slimes before the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus one (to account for the current slime itself).
   - We use `func_1` to find the index of the smallest prefix sum greater than `x`.
   - `inx2` is set to `last[i - 1]` to handle cases where the current slime could have been eaten by a previous slime of the same size.
   - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, we update `inx` to `inx2`.
   - If `inx` is still negative, we skip this slime.
   - Otherwise, we compute the time taken as `i + 1 - inx` and store it in `ans[i]`.

### Verification

The logic seems correct in terms of identifying the nearest smaller slime and calculating the time taken for each slime to be eaten. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

1. **Edge Cases:** The function handles cases where a slime is smaller than the previous one correctly by setting `ans[i] = 1`.
2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:** The cumulative sum calculation is correct.
3. **Binary Search Usage:** The usage of `func_1` to find the appropriate index is correct.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, given the constraints and examples provided.
