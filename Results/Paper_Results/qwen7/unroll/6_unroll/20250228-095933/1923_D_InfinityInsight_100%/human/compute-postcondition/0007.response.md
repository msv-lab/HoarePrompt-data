Output State: `left` is a list containing [0, 0+i, 0+i+(i+1), ..., 0+i+(i+1)+...+(n-2)+(n-1)]; `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in the array `a`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the array `a`. For each iteration, the `left` list appends the current value of `left[-1]` (which is the last value in the `left` list) plus the current element `i`. This results in a cumulative sum being added to the `left` list for each element in `a`. The `last` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop, and the `ans` list stays as a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1.
