### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds the smallest index of a slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses binary search via `bisect_left` to find the first occurrence of `x` or the next largest value.
   - If such a slime exists, it returns the index plus one (`inx + 1`).
   - Otherwise, it returns -1.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
   - It maintains two auxiliary lists: `left` and `last`.
     - `left` stores cumulative sums of the slimes' sizes up to each position.
     - `last` stores the last occurrence index of each slime size.
   - For each slime, it checks if the current slime can eat its left neighbor.
   - If the current slime cannot eat its left neighbor, it checks if it can eat its right neighbor using the `func_1` function.
   - The result is stored in the `ans` list, which is returned at the end.

3. **Main Program**:
   - It processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` twice: once with the original list and once with the reversed list.
   - It then compares the results and updates the final answer list accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: The `left` list correctly accumulates the sizes of the slimes up to each position.
- **Last Occurrence Index**: The `last` list correctly tracks the last occurrence of each slime size.
- **Eating Conditions**: The logic for checking if a slime can eat its neighbor is correct. It uses binary search (`func_1`) to find the appropriate index efficiently.
- **Handling Impossible Cases**: The code correctly handles cases where a slime cannot eat any of its neighbors by setting the corresponding value in `ans` to -1.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
