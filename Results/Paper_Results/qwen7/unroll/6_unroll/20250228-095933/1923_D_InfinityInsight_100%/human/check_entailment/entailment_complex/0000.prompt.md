Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of positive integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and x is a non-negative integer representing a target size.
def func_1(a, x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: a is a list of positive integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and x is a non-negative integer representing a target size, and x is greater than or equal to 0
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if (a[inx] == x) :
        return inx + 1
        #The program returns inx + 1, where inx is the index of the first slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`
    #State: `a` is a list of positive integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `x` is a non-negative integer representing a target size, and `inx` is the index of the first slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. The first slime in the list at index `inx` is greater than `x`.
    return inx
    #The program returns the index of the first slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a non-negative integer `x`. It searches for the smallest index of a slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If such a slime exists, it returns either the index of the first slime that meets the condition (Case_3) or `inx + 1` where `inx` is the index of the first slime that meets the condition (Case_2). If no slime in the list meets the condition, it returns -1 (Case_1).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. Each integer in the list a is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

    #
    #To explain further, the `last` list keeps track of the most recent index at which each value in the array `a` appears. The `left` list remains unchanged as it only contains the initial value of 0. The `ans` list is not affected by the loop and retains its initial state of all elements being -1.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` from the first element to the last; `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in the array `a`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)

            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` from the first element to the last; `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in the array `a`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, potentially updated to `i + 1 - inx` if certain conditions are met during each iteration.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, potentially updated to `i + 1 - last[a[i]]` if certain conditions are met during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`, where each element in `ans` is calculated based on specific conditions encountered during the iteration, potentially updating to `i + 1 - last[a[i]]` if certain conditions are met during each iteration. The function constructs two auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to keep track of cumulative sums and the last occurrence indices, respectively, and uses these to determine the values in the output list `ans`.
