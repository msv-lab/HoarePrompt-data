Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the case where a slime cannot eat any of its neighbors and thus remains un-eaten. This can be seen in the example input provided:

```
5
2 2 3 1 1
```

In this case, the output should be `2 1 -1 1 2`, indicating that the first, second, fourth, and fifth slimes will eventually be eaten after 2, 1, 1, and 2 seconds respectively, while the third slime will never be eaten because there is no larger slime next to it. However, the program does not account for the possibility that a slime might never be eaten, leading to incorrect results.
