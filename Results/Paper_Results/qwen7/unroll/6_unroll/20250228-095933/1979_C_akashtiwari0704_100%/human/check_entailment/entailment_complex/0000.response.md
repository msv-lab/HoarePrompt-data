Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The solution involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and using it to determine the bets.

2. **Key Steps in the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using the `lcm` function.
   - It then calculates the sum of the bets, which are derived from the LCM divided by each multiplier.
   - If the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The use of LCM ensures that the sum of the bets is minimized while still being a multiple of each individual bet amount.
   - The condition `sumo >= prod` correctly identifies when the sum of the bets is not strictly less than the LCM.
   - The derived bets are calculated correctly as `prod // a[i]`, ensuring that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the LCM.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the sum of the bets is not strictly less than the LCM by printing `-1`.
   - The code also handles the constraints correctly, as the LCM calculation and the sum check ensure that the conditions are met.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
