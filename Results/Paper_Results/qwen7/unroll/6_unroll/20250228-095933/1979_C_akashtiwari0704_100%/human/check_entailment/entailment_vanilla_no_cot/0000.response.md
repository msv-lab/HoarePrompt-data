Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers. However, the logic to determine the distribution of coins is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers and then divides it by each multiplier to get the bets. This approach does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates `a[i] = prod // a[i]` where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers. This does not necessarily ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. For example, if the multipliers are `[2, 3, 6]`, the LCM is `6`. Dividing `6` by each multiplier gives `[3, 2, 1]`, but the total bet is `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`, which is not strictly less than the rewards for any outcome.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if `sumo >= prod` to determine if the solution is invalid. While this check is correct, the method to calculate `a[i]` is flawed.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate the minimum bet for each outcome
        min_bets = []
        for i in range(bets):
            min_bet = 1
            for j in range(bets):
                if i != j:
                    min_bet *= a[j]
                    min_bet //= gcd(min_bet, a[j])
            min_bets.append(min_bet)
        
        # Check if a solution exists
        if all(min_bets[i] * a[i] < sum(min_bets) for i in range(bets)):
            ans = ' '.join(str(b) for b in min_bets)
            print(ans)
        else:
            print(-1)


# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Calculate Minimum Bet for Each Outcome**: For each outcome `i`, we calculate the minimum bet required such that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for outcome `i`. This is done by ensuring that the bet for each other outcome is included in the calculation.
2. **Check Feasibility**: We check if the total bet for any outcome is strictly less than the reward for that outcome.
3. **Output Result**: If a feasible solution exists, we print the bets; otherwise, we print `-1`.

This approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome, adhering to the problem constraints.
