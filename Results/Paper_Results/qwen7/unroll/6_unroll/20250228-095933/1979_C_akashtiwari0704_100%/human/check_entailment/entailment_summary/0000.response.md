Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each outcome and then determining if the sum of the bets, based on the LCM, is less than the LCM itself. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it indicates that the conditions of the problem cannot be met, and thus, it should print `-1`. Otherwise, it should print a distribution of bets that satisfies the conditions.

Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating LCM**: The `lcm` function correctly computes the least common multiple of the list of multipliers.
3. **Distribution Calculation**: For each outcome, the program calculates the bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of the multipliers. This ensures that the total bet amount is distributed proportionally to the multipliers.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The program sums up the calculated bet amounts and checks if this sum is less than the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`.
5. **Output**: If the sum is less than the LCM, the program constructs and prints the required distribution of bets.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program logic aligns with the requirements. The program correctly handles the constraints and produces the expected output based on the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
