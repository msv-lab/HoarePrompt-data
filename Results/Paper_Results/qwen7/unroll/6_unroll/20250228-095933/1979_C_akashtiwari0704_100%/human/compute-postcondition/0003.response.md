Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 50. Additionally, a list `k` containing `n` positive integers, each within the range 2 to 20, is processed. The function returns information based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each defined by values of `t`, `n`, and a list `k`. It processes these inputs without needing them as explicit function parameters, deriving them from the context in which the function is called.
