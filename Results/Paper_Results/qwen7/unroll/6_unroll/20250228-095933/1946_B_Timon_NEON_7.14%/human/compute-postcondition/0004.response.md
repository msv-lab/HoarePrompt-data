State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `len(arr)` is the length of the list `arr`**.

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `len(arr)`.
2. **Adjusting `i`**: For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range `[0, len(arr))`. Since the loop starts at `i = 0`, `i` should be set to `0`.
3. **Expression `len(arr)`**: This expression determines the upper limit of the loop. It must be evaluated to the actual length of the list `arr`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to `0` and `len(arr)` to its actual value, while keeping other variables as they are since they don't directly affect the loop's execution.
