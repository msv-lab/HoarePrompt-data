Output State: **`pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**

The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `price_increase`. This initializes `price_increase` but does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `pq`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `total_cost`, and `tickets_bought` remain unchanged.
