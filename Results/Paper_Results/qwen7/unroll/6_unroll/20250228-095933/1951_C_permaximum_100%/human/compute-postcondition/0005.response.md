The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end. For the loop to execute the first time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the given state since `tickets_bought` is already 0, which is less than any positive integer `k`. The loop can certainly execute the first time based on the current state.

State: **`pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**
