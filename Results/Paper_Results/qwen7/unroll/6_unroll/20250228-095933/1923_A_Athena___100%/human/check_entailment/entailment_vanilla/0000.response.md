### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to move chips to the leftmost possible positions to form a single block without any free cells between them.
   - The provided solution does not correctly simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells with chips (1) or free (0).
   - It removes leading zeros (free cells at the start) and trailing zeros (free cells at the end).
   - It counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a`, which it prints as the result.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The solution does not simulate the actual movement of chips to the closest free cell to the left.
   - It only counts the number of free cells at the start and end, which does not reflect the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left until no more moves can be made.
   - We should keep track of the number of operations performed during this process.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
