The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of test cases, an integer n indicating the number of cells, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) indicating the presence of chips in the cells. It removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the number of remaining zeros. For each test case, it prints the count of zeros.
