The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two lists of integers `L` and `M`, and calculates a cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. It sorts the list `M`, selects the first `q` elements where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`, and computes the cost according to specific conditions. The function prints the calculated cost for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs `t` costs, one for each test case.
