Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) exceeds the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). Specifically, the program assumes that `m` is always less than or equal to `k`, which is not necessarily true. 

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
5 100 101
1 1 1 1 1
```
- Expected output: `101`
- Actual output: `10201`

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the cost because it does not account for the possibility that `k` might exceed `n * m`. The program sorts the array and then tries to distribute the tickets across the days, but it fails to handle the edge case where `k` is larger than `n * m`.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `k > n * m` by purchasing tickets in a way that minimizes the total cost. This involves distributing the tickets across the days in a manner that accounts for the increasing prices due to the purchase of tickets on previous days.
