Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and produces an output for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.
