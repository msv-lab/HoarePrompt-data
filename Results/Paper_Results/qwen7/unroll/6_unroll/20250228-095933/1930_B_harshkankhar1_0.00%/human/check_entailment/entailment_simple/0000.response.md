### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly with the loop `for _ in range(int(input()))`.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, a list `a` is created containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The list `a` is then modified such that every other element starting from index 0 (even indices) is reversed. This means the elements at even indices will be in descending order, while the elements at odd indices remain in ascending order.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the list `a` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the even indices, it becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.

3. **Divisibility Condition**:
   - The generated permutation ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `i â‰  j`) exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{i+1}`.
   - By reversing the even indices, the larger numbers are placed in positions where they cannot divide smaller numbers in the next position due to their relative positions.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the generated permutation for each test case.

### Verification:
- For `n = 4`, the permutation `[4, 2, 3, 1]` is valid because:
  - `4` does not divide `2`, `3`, or `1`.
  - `2` does not divide `3` or `1`.
  - `3` does not divide `1`.

- For `n = 3`, the permutation `[3, 2, 1]` is valid because:
  - `3` does not divide `2` or `1`.
  - `2` does not divide `1`.

Given these observations, the program generates a valid permutation for each test case according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid permutation for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
