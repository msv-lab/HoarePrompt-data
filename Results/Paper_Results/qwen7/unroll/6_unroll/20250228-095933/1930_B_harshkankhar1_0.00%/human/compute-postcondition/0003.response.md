Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result based on the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and `n`, and it processes these according to certain rules or operations defined elsewhere in the function's body. The exact nature of these operations is not specified here, only the constraints and structure of the input data.
