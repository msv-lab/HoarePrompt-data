You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. It checks whether `b` is an even number and returns either 'yes' or 'no' based on this check.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution provided uses a function `func_1` to check if Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns `'yes'` if \(b \% 2 == 0\) (i.e., if \(b\) is even) and `'no'` otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` checks if \(b\) is even.
   - If \(b\) is even, the function returns `'yes'`, indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is odd, the function returns `'no'`, indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \(b\) is even:**
     - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles.
     - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle, such as \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - **Case 2: \(b\) is odd:**
     - If \(b\) is odd, the only way to cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle is into two \(a \times 1\) rectangles.
     - These two \(a \times 1\) rectangles can only be rearranged to form the original \(a \times b\) rectangle or its rotations, which do not count as a different rectangle.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the function `func_1` correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle based on whether \(b\) is even or odd.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description.
