### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution provided uses a function `func_1` to check if Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns `'yes'` if \(b \% 2 == 0\) (i.e., if \(b\) is even) and `'no'` otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` checks if \(b\) is even.
   - If \(b\) is even, the function returns `'yes'`, indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is odd, the function returns `'no'`, indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \(b\) is even:**
     - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles.
     - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle, such as \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - **Case 2: \(b\) is odd:**
     - If \(b\) is odd, the only way to cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle is into two \(a \times 1\) rectangles.
     - These two \(a \times 1\) rectangles can only be rearranged to form the original \(a \times b\) rectangle or its rotations, which do not count as a different rectangle.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the function `func_1` correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle based on whether \(b\) is even or odd.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment concluded that the given program is correct. However, upon closer inspection, there is a flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`.

- **Flaw in the Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` only checks if \(b\) is even, but it does not account for all possible ways to cut the rectangle.
  - For example, consider the case where \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\). According to the problem statement, Bob can cut the \(3 \times 2\) rectangle into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and rearrange them to form a \(6 \times 1\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(3 \times 2\) rectangle.
  - Similarly, for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), Bob can cut the \(2 \times 6\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and rearrange them to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(2 \times 6\) rectangle.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, because:
    - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles along the \(a\) dimension.
    - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles along the \(b\) dimension.
  - Therefore, the function should return `'yes'` if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected logic, the original assessment was inaccurate. The provided solution only checks if \(b\) is even, missing cases where \(a\) could be even.

Final: **False**
