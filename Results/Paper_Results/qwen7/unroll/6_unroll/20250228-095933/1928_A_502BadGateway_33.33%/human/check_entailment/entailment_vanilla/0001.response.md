### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution provided uses a function `func_1` to check if Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns `'yes'` if \(b \% 2 == 0\) (i.e., if \(b\) is even) and `'no'` otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` checks if \(b\) is even.
   - If \(b\) is even, the function returns `'yes'`, indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is odd, the function returns `'no'`, indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \(b\) is even:**
     - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles.
     - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle, such as \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - **Case 2: \(b\) is odd:**
     - If \(b\) is odd, the only way to cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle is into two \(a \times 1\) rectangles.
     - These two \(a \times 1\) rectangles can only be rearranged to form the original \(a \times b\) rectangle or its rotations, which do not count as a different rectangle.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the function `func_1` correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle based on whether \(b\) is even or odd.
