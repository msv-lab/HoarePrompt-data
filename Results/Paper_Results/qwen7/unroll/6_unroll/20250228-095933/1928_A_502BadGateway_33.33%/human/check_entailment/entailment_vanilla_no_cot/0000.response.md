Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. According to the problem statement, a new rectangle can be formed if either `a` or `b` is even, but the current implementation only considers `b`.

To fix this, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is even:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

With this corrected function, the program should work as expected based on the problem description.
