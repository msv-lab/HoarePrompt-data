Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if a given rectangle \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reassembled into a different rectangle.
- The provided code only checks if \(b\) is even using the function `func_1(a, b)`. However, this is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.
- For instance, a rectangle \(2 \times 6\) can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and reassembled into a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is a different rectangle. This scenario is not covered by checking if \(b\) is even.
- The function should consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and check if the resulting pieces can form a different rectangle. Simply checking if \(b\) is even does not cover all cases where a different rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks if \(b\) is even, which does not account for all possible ways to cut and reassemble the rectangle into a different shape.
