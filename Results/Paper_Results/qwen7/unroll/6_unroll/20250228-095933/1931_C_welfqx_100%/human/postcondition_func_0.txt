The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the array), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum length of consecutive identical elements in both the original and reversed arrays. It then prints the difference between the length of the array \( n \) and the maximum of these two lengths.
