Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `nums` is a set containing the unique elements from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements (assuming space-separated integers), and then converts these elements into a set of unique integers. The initial values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged, while `nums` now holds the unique integers from the input.
