Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables in the loop head**:
   - `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range, so its value is not relevant for the adjustment.
   - `int(input())` is the input that determines the number of iterations. Since this input is provided at runtime, we cannot directly adjust the state of `int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Given that the task is to modify the initial state, we need to ensure that the input will be a valid number of iterations.

4. **Consider the constraints**:
   - The input should be within the range 1 to 100 (inclusive).

Given these points, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted such that the input provided to `int(input())` is a valid number of iterations (i.e., an integer between 1 and 100).

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, and the input provided to `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and 100**.
