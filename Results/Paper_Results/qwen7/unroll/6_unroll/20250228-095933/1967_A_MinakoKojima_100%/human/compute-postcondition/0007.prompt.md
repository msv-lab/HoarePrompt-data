You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}.
def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = a[0]
        
        res = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        
        ans += res
        
        ans_list.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing integers calculated from the loop executions, with each element representing the final value of `ans` for each input iteration. The value of `t` is the number of iterations in the loop, and for each iteration, `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on user input, leading to a different `ans` value which is then appended to `ans_list`.
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)
        
    #State: The output state will remain the same as the initial state because the loop does not modify any variables or perform any operations that change the values within `ans_list`. The loop simply iterates over the elements in `ans_list` and prints them, but it does not alter the contents of `ans_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). It returns a value based on the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
