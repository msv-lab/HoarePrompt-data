### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and function summaries to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input**: A row of depths `row` and an integer `d`.
- **Output**: The minimum total cost to place supports in the row such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.

The function works as follows:
1. Initialize the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of `1` (base cost for the first support).
2. Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` apart.
3. For each subsequent element, update the cost based on the minimum cost from the heap.
4. Return the cost of the last element, which represents the total cost for the row.

This function is correctly implemented and ensures that the cost is minimized for each row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input**: Four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a list of `n` lists `rows` where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of river cells.
- **Output**: The minimum total cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

The function works as follows:
1. Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
2. Read the depths of each row into a list of lists called `rows`.
3. Compute the cost for each row using `func_1` and store these costs in a list called `costs`.
4. Iterate through the `costs` list to find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
5. Print the minimum total cost.

The function summary indicates that the function correctly calculates the sum of every consecutive sublist of length `k` within the list `costs` and returns the minimum value among all these sums. This aligns with the problem statement and the intended functionality.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Heap Usage in `func_1`:**
   - The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` apart.
   - This ensures that the cost calculation is optimal for each row.

2. **Cost Calculation for Rows in `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements with a base cost of `1`.
   - The loop updates the cost based on the minimum cost from the heap, ensuring that the distance constraint is maintained.

3. **Total Cost Calculation in `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then iterates through the `costs` list to find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - The logic for finding the minimum total cost is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program and function summaries are consistent with the problem description and the intended solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.
