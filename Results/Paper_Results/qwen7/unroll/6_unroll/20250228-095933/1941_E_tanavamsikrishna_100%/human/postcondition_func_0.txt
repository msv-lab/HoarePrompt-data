The function accepts a list of integers `row` representing the depths of river cells in a single row and a positive integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports. It modifies the `row` list by setting the first element to 2 and each subsequent element up to the length of `row` to 4. Additionally, it uses a min-heap to track the minimum values within a sliding window of size `d+2`. After processing, the function returns the last element of the modified `row` list, which is 6.
