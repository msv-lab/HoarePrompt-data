Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1.
2. **Initial Cost Calculation**: For the first `d` elements, it adds 2 to each element and sets the initial cost.
3. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row.
4. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each subsequent element in the row, it removes the smallest element from the heap that is within the required distance `d` and updates the current element's cost.
5. **Heap Operations**: It maintains the heap to ensure the smallest possible cost is considered for each position.

The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to find the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row under the given constraints.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of each cell in the grid.
2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**: It calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It computes the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of the selected rows.
4. **Result Output**: It prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

The logic in `func_2` appears to correctly implement the solution for the entire problem, considering the constraints and requirements.

### Verification
To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that:
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row.
- The combination of rows in `func_2` correctly finds the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the functions seem to handle the logic appropriately.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
