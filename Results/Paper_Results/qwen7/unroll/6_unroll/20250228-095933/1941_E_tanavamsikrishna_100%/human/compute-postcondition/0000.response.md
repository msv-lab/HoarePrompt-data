Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the integers inputted separated by spaces; `rows` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. It also initializes `rows` as a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each inner list being 0. However, since no specific values are provided for `rows` in the given code snippet, the state of `rows` remains as initially described in the precondition.
