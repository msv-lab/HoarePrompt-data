Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the integers inputted separated by spaces; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0; `rows` is updated with the new values from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` space-separated integers, and constructs a list of lists (`rows`) where each inner list represents a row of the river with `m` cells. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0, as specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.
