### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function sets the first element of the row to 1.
   - For the next `d-1` elements, it sets each to 3.
   - This part of the function does not seem to align with the problem's constraints. The goal is to place supports such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and the cost is minimized.

2. **Heap Operations:**
   - A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row.
   - The function then iterates over the remaining elements of the row.
   - For each element, it pops the smallest element from the heap whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - It then updates the current element in the row by adding the popped element's value plus one.
   - Both the updated value and the original value are pushed back into the heap.
   - This process ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

However, there are a few issues:
- The initial setup of the first `d` elements to 3 does not reflect the actual problem constraints.
- The logic inside the loop does not ensure that the distance between supports is exactly `d` or less. Instead, it seems to be trying to find the minimum value within a sliding window of size `d+2`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the dimensions and the input matrix of river depths.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each row to compute the cost of placing supports.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The costs for each row are stored in the `costs` list.
   - The function then computes the sum of every consecutive sublist of length `k` within the `costs` list.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value among these sums.

#### Overall Program Analysis:
- The program attempts to use a sliding window approach to find the minimum cost of placing supports in each row.
- However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem's constraints.
- The initial setup and the logic inside the loop do not ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and the overall logic does not accurately compute the minimum total cost of installing supports.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem's constraints.
