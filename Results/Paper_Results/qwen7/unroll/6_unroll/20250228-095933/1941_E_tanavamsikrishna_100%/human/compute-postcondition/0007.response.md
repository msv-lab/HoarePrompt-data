To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total_costs` is a list where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`, then `total_costs` would be `[3, 5, 7]` because:
     - The first element of `total_costs` is `1 + 2 = 3`
     - The second element of `total_costs` is `2 + 3 = 5`
     - The third element of `total_costs` is `3 + 4 = 7`

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```

Given the above, the `min(total_costs)` function will return the smallest value in the `total_costs` list. Since `total_costs` contains sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, the smallest sum will be the one corresponding to the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum value among all the sums of `k` consecutive elements in `costs`.

Output: **the minimum value among all the sums of k consecutive elements in costs**
