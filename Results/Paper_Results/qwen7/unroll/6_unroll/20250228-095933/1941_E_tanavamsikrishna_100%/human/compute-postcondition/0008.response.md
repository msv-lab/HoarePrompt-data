Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists. Each inner list has m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells. The function returns a value based on certain conditions involving these parameters and the list.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` with specified ranges, and a list `rows` consisting of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers. The function then processes this input according to some logic that involves these parameters and the structure of the `rows` list, ultimately returning a result based on the given conditions.
