### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the provided function summaries to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires minimizing the total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. The key constraints are:
1. A support must be installed in the first and last columns of each row.
2. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports in a single row under the given constraints. Here is the breakdown of the function:

```python
def func_1(row, d: int):
    row[0] = 1  # Support at the first column
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2  # Cost of placing a support in the first d columns
    min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass  # Remove invalid entries from the heap
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1  # Cost of placing a support at position i
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]
```

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the cost of the first column to 1 and the next \(d-1\) columns to their respective depths plus 2.
2. **Heap Initialization**: A min heap is initialized with the first \(d\) elements of the row.
3. **Heap Processing**: For each subsequent element in the row, the function ensures that the heap only contains valid positions (i.e., those that are at least \(d+2\) units away from the last added position). It then updates the cost of placing a support at the current position and adds the new position to the heap.

This approach ensures that the distance constraint is maintained and the cost is minimized.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
The function `func_2` processes the entire grid and calculates the minimum total cost for building \(k\) bridges on consecutive rows:

```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
```

1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the dimensions and the grid from the input.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It calculates the cost of building a bridge on each row using `func_1`.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It computes the minimum total cost for building \(k\) bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of each possible \(k\)-sublist and finding the minimum sum.

Given the correct implementation of `func_1`, this approach should correctly find the minimum total cost.

#### Validation Against Original Assessment
The original assessment claimed that `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem's constraints. However, the provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic to minimize the cost while respecting the distance constraint. The heap-based approach ensures that the distance between supports is maintained and the cost is minimized.

Therefore, the original assessment seems to be inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges on consecutive rows of the river grid.
