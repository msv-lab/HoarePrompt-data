The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists named `rows`. Each inner list contains \( m \) positive integers representing the depths of river cells. The function calculates the sum of every consecutive sublist of length \( k \) within the list `costs`, which is derived from `rows` using `func_1` with parameter \( d \). Finally, it returns the minimum value among all these sums.
