### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the start and end of the row, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It initializes the first element of the row to 2 and each subsequent element up to the length of the row to 4.
   - It uses a min-heap to ensure that the cost of installing supports is minimized within a sliding window of size \( d+2 \).
   - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which is the total cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the sum of every consecutive sublist of length \( k \) within the list of costs.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value among all these sums.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row by ensuring the distance constraint and using a min-heap.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum cost for \( k \) consecutive rows by summing the costs and finding the minimum sum.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation of the functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
