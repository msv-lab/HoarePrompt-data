Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: The function `func_1` correctly takes the necessary parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as specified in the problem statement.
2. **Initialization**: The function initializes a counter for `b` (`cb`) and a counter for the first `m` elements of `a` (`ca`). It also initializes `ans` to zero and calculates the initial sum of the intersection of these two counters (`sm`).
3. **Initial Check**: If the initial sum `sm` is already greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans` because the first segment of length `m` in `a` is already a good subsegment.
4. **Sliding Window Logic**: The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent segment of length `m` in `a`. For each new element added to the window (`a[r]`), it increases the count in `ca`. For each element that leaves the window (`a[r - m]`), it decreases the count in `ca`.
5. **Update Sum**: After updating the counts, it recalculates the sum of the intersection (`sm`). If this sum is now greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.
6. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles the edge case where the initial segment is already good, and it correctly updates the counts and sums for each subsequent segment.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the number of good subsegments of length `m` in array `a` that contain at least `k` elements from array `b`.

Correctness: **True**
