You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. For each value of `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers. It then calculates a value `ans` based on the given logic and prints the result for each iteration. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each containing the calculated value of `ans` for the corresponding input pair `(n, m)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 are met and if the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6. The function returns a result based on these conditions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
