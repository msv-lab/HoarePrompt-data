Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The provided solution simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case. Let's analyze whether this approach meets the requirements:

1. **GCD Calculation**: 
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and hence coprime.
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x\).

2. **Maximizing the Expression**:
   - Since \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) simplifies to \( x \) when \( y = x - 1 \), this choice indeed maximizes the expression for the given constraints.

3. **Range Check**:
   - For any \( x \) in the range \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \), \( y = x - 1 \) will be in the range \( 1 \leq y < x \).

Given these points, the solution correctly finds the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) by setting \( y = x - 1 \).

Correctness: **True**
