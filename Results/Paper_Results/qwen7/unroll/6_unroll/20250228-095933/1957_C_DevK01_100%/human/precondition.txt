t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The k moves you have already played are represented by pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and these moves do not result in any two rooks attacking each other either directly or through the computer's mirrored moves.
