You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5; k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n; for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks attack each other based on the described rules.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: Output State: `dp` is a list of length `n`, where each element is calculated based on the recurrence relation `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`, with the initial values `[1, 1]`.
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `dp` which is calculated based on the recurrence relation \((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) \% (7 + 10^9)\) for \(i\) ranging from 2 to \(n\), starting with the initial values \([1, 1]\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the last element of the list `dp` calculated using the recurrence relation \((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) \% (7 + 10^9)\) for \(i\) ranging from 2 to \(n\), starting with the initial values \([1, 1]\).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `dp` which is calculated based on the recurrence relation \((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) \% (7 + 10^9)\) for \(i\) ranging from 2 to \(n\), starting with the initial values \([1, 1]\).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
