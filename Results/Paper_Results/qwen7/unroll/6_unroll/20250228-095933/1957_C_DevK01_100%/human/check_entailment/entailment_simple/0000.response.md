### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move places a rook such that no two rooks attack each other. The computer mirrors the player's move unless the move is along the diagonal.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\).
   - It processes each of the \(k\) moves, reducing the effective size of the board by 1 for each non-diagonal move and by 2 for each diagonal move.
   - After processing the moves, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` with base cases `[1, 1]`.
   - For each subsequent value up to \(n\), it calculates the number of configurations using the recurrence relation \((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) \% (10^9 + 7)\).
   - The final result is returned as `dp[-1]`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for updating the board size based on the moves is correct.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` correctly computes the number of configurations for the reduced board size.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
