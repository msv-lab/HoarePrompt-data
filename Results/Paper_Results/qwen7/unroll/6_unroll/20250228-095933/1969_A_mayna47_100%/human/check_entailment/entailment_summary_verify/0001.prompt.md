You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list `p` of integers for each test case, where `n` (the length of the list) ranges from 2 to 50, and each integer in the list is unique and between 1 and `n`, exclusive. It constructs a list `v` based on the input and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints either `2` or `3` based on the condition check.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.

3. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - Initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it with the input values.
   - Iterates through each friend to check if the friend and their best friend form a pair where both get invited (`v[v[i]] == i`).
     - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where a pair of friends can be invited together correctly.
   - However, the code does not handle cases where multiple pairs might exist but only one pair is checked.

5. **Verification:**
   - The code logic seems to be missing a more comprehensive check to ensure that the minimum number of invitations is calculated correctly for all scenarios.
   - For example, if there are multiple pairs, the code currently only checks the first pair found and stops, which may not always give the optimal solution.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of invitations needed for all test cases. It only checks for the first pair and does not account for multiple pairs or the possibility of needing more than 2 invitations if no direct pair exists.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases. It needs to check for multiple pairs and ensure the minimum number of invitations is calculated accurately.
