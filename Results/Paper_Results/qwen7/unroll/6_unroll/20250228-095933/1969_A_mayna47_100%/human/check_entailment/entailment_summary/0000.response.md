Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. It constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
4. The program then iterates through the list to check if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it means that sending invitations to these two friends will ensure that both come to the party, hence the program prints `2` and returns.
5. If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`, which seems to be a default value based on the provided examples and the problem constraints. However, the problem statement does not specify what to do if no such pair exists, and the examples provided suggest that `3` might be the correct answer in such cases.

Given the examples and the problem description, the program logic appears to be correct. It handles the cases where at least one pair of mutual best friends exists by printing `2` and covers the scenario where no such pair exists by printing `3`.

Correctness: **True**
