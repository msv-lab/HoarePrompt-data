Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1` (exclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure that `i` is within the range `[1, n]` for the loop to execute.
   - `n` must be within the range `[2, 50]` for the loop to be valid.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 1 and `n` being within the specified range.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**
