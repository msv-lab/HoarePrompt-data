Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. It constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
4. The program then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such an index exists, it means that `i` and `v[i]` are best friends of each other, and inviting both of them will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, it prints `2` and returns.
5. If no such index exists, the program prints `3`. This is because, in the worst case, we need to invite three friends to ensure that at least two come to the party. This is derived from the fact that if no pair of mutual best friends exists, we must invite the best friend of the first friend, the best friend of the second friend, and the first friend himself (or another similar combination).

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
