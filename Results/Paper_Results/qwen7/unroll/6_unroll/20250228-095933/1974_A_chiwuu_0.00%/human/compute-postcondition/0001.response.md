State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
- For the loop `for i in range(n)` to execute, the value of `n` must be a non-negative integer greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
- Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0.

This ensures that the loop can begin its execution correctly.
