Based on the initial state described, let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `x` and `y` are strings.
   - For the first half of the strings:
     - Each character in `x` is the maximum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`.
     - Each character in `y` is the minimum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`.
   - For the second half of the strings:
     - Each character in `x` is the minimum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`.
     - Each character in `y` is the maximum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The print statement is empty: `print()`.
   - Since there is no content inside the `print()` function, it will simply print an empty line.

Therefore, the output will be an empty line.

Output: **''**
