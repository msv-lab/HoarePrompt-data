Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is an issue because the function definition does not match the usage in the main loop.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_1()` aims to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits.
   - For the first half of the digits (up to the middle), it swaps the smaller digit with the larger one.
   - For the second half of the digits, it swaps the smaller digit with the larger one.
   - This logic is intended to maximize the value of the numbers by ensuring that the higher digits are placed in the more significant positions.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified values of `a` and `b` (which are the lists of characters representing `x` and `y`).
   - The output format matches the requirement of printing two lines per test case.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1()` is not being called in the main loop. Instead, the code directly processes the input within the loop without calling the function.
- The function definition is unnecessary and can be removed since the logic is directly implemented in the loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program, after removing the unnecessary function definition, will work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the corrected program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
