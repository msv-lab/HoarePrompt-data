Based on the initial state provided:

- The set `ans` contains all the positions of players who could potentially have the ball after `m` throws.
- If `0` is in the set `ans`, the position `n` is added to the set.
- If `0` is not in the set `ans`, the set remains unchanged.

The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted elements of the set `ans`.

Since the exact contents of `ans` are not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **sorted(ans) where ans is a set containing all the positions of players who could potentially have the ball after m throws, and if 0 is in ans, n is also added to the set**
