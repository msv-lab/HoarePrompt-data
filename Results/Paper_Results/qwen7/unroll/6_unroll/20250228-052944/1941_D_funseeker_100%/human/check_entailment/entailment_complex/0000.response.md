Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function correctly processes input for each test case and subsequent data.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: Calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value. This function correctly handles the input for the number of test cases and initializes the process for each test case.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: Calls `func_1()` and processes the input for each test case, returning a list of integers. This function correctly parses the number of players, throws, and the initial player for each test case.

4. **Function `func_4()`**: 
   - Initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
   - Iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in based on the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or `?`).
   - Handles both clockwise (`0`) and counterclockwise (`1`) directions, as well as unknown directions (`?`).
   - Ensures that the ball's position wraps around the circle using modulo arithmetic.
   - Correctly handles the special case where the ball could be at position `0` and adjusts the set accordingly.
   - Outputs the number of possible positions and the sorted list of those positions.

Given the detailed explanation and the logical flow of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It processes each test case, updates the possible positions of the ball based on the given throws, and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
