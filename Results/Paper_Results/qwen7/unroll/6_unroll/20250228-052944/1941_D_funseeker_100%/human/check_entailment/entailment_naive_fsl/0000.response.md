Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input as specified, processes each throw to update the possible positions of the ball, and handles both clockwise and counterclockwise directions appropriately. The use of sets ensures that only unique player numbers are stored, and the final output is formatted correctly. Given the complexity of the problem and the thorough handling of all possible inputs and conditions, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
