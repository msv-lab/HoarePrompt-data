Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set containing the initial player `x`, and `ans` is equal to `{x}`.**

The code initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`, which means `ans` now contains only the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
