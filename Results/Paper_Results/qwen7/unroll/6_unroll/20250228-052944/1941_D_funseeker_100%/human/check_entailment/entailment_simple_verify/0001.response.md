### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly uses `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to parse the input. This is accurate and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct as the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Loop Through Throws**:
   - The program iterates through each throw using a loop that runs `m` times. For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`. This part is also correct.

4. **Direction Handling**:
   - If the direction is '0' or '?', the program adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' or '?', the program adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This logic correctly handles both the specified and uncertain directions.

5. **Update Set**:
   - After processing each throw, the program updates the set `ans` with the new possible positions. This ensures that only valid positions are kept.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and if so, replaces it with `n` to handle the modulo operation edge case. This is correct.

7. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the number of possible players and their sorted positions. This matches the required output format.

However, there is a subtle issue in the handling of the set `ans` during the loop. Specifically, the use of `temp` and directly updating `ans` with `temp` might lead to incorrect results if the same player is added multiple times in different iterations. The set `ans` should be updated by merging the new set `temp` with the existing set `ans` to avoid duplicates.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        ans.update(temp)
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected understanding, the original assessment missed the potential issue with duplicate entries in the set `ans`. The corrected code ensures that the set `ans` is updated correctly without duplicates.

**Final: True**
