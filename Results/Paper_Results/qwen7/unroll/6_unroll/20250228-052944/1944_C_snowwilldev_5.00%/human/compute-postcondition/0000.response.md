Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for tc in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `tc` and the input value that determines the range.

2. **Determine the initial state of `tc`**: The variable `tc` is used as an index in the `range` function, and it starts from 0 (since `range(start, stop)` generates numbers from `start` up to but not including `stop`). 

3. **Determine the input value**: The input value that determines the range is obtained from `int(input())`. This value represents the number of test cases (`t`), and it must be a positive integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by setting the initial state of `tc` to 0 and ensuring that the input value (which is `t`) is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `tc` is 0
- The input value (which is `t`) must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)

So, the final state is:

**State: **`tc` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\)**
