Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The goal is to determine the game's final score based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob, where Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, and Bob aims to minimize it. However, the given code does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob nor does it construct the array `c` as specified in the problem statement.

The function `func()` simply counts the occurrences of each integer in the input list `a` and prints the index of the first unique integer or the first zero encountered. This does not reflect the game's rules or the optimal strategies of the players.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`, while Bob removes an element from `a`. The MEX of `c` should be calculated at the end of the game.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
