Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` for each test case defined by `t`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 20,000 inclusive. For each test case, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers each less than `n`. The function returns information based on the values in list `a` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `t`, `n`, and list `a`. It processes each list `a` according to the given constraints and returns results specific to each test case.
