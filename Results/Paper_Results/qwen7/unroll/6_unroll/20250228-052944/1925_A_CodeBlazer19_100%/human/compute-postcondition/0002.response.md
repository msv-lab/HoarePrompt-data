Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each containing a string of length `k` repeated `n` times, where `n` and `k` are provided for each line by the user. The strings are formed from the first `k` characters of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The number of such lines equals the value of `t`, which is initially provided by the user. Each line is generated independently based on the corresponding `n` and `k` values.
