### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the provided program and the problem statement to confirm this.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, appending it to her array `c`, and deleting it from `a`.
- Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it.
- The game continues until `a` is empty.
- The score is the MEX of `c`.
- Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `arr` directly, without simulating the game turns.
- It uses a frequency array to count occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- It then iterates through the frequencies to find the first integer that appears exactly once and prints it.
- This approach does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob and their strategic choices.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Let's re-examine the provided test cases with the correct understanding of the game:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Alice can pick `1` first, making `c = [1]`. Bob then picks `0`, making `c = [1, 0]`. Alice picks `0`, making `c = [1, 0, 0]`. Bob picks `1`, making `c = [0, 0]`. The MEX of `[0, 0]` is `2`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Alice can pick `0` first, making `c = [0]`. Bob then picks `1`, making `c = [0]`. Alice picks `2`, making `c = [0, 2]`. Bob picks `3`, making `c = [0, 2]`. The MEX of `[0, 2]` is `1`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `2 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Alice can pick `1` first, making `c = [1]`. Bob then picks `1`, making `c = [1]`. The MEX of `[1]` is `0`.

The provided program does not simulate these strategies and simply finds the MEX of the initial array `arr`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during their turns.

**Final: False**
