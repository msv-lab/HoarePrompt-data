Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum excluded value (MEX) of the array `c` based on the frequency of elements in `arr`. However, the current implementation does not align with the problem requirements.
2. The problem requires determining the optimal MEX value considering the turns of Alice and Bob. Alice can pick any element from `arr` and append it to `c`, while Bob can only delete an element from `arr`.
3. The current implementation of `func_1` simply counts the frequency of each element in `arr` and prints the first element that appears exactly once or twice, or the first zero frequency element. This does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.
4. To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the turns and the optimal strategy:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX value.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX value.
   - Alice can always pick the smallest missing number that hasn't been picked yet.
   - Bob will remove the smallest number available in his turn.
5. Given the optimal strategy, the final MEX value can be determined by checking the smallest number that is not present in the array after both players have taken their turns optimally.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
