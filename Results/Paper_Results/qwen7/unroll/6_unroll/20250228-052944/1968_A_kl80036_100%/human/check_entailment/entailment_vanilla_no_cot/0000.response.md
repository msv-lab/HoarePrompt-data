Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not always yield the correct result. The goal is to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) where \(1 \leq y < x\). Simply choosing \(y = x - 1\) does not guarantee the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider \(x = 10\):
- If we choose \(y = 9\), then \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
- But if we choose \(y = 5\), then \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the same but might be a better choice depending on the definition of "maximum possible" in the context of the problem.

A more accurate approach would involve iterating through all possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(x-1\) and finding the one that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max_value = -1
        best_y = -1
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_value = gcd(x, y) + y
            if current_value > max_value:
                max_value = current_value
                best_y = y
        print(best_y)
```

This version iterates through all possible values of \(y\) and keeps track of the one that gives the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
