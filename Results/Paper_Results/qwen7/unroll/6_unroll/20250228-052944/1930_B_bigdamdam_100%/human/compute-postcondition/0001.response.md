Output State: The array `p` will contain alternating values starting from `n` down to `1` if `n` is even, or `n-1` if `n` is odd. Specifically, the first half of the array `p` will contain decreasing even numbers (if `n` is even) or odd numbers (if `n` is odd), and the second half will contain increasing even numbers (if `n` is odd) or odd numbers (if `n` is even).
