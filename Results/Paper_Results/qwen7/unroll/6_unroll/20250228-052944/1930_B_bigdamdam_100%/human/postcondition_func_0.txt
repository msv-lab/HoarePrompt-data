The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). For each n, it generates a list p of length n. Elements at even indices in p are filled with values starting from n and decrementing by 2, while elements at odd indices are filled with values starting from 1 plus the remainder when n is divided by 2 and incrementing by 2. The function prints the generated list p for each test case.
