Output State: `results` is a list where each element is the count of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each array in `test_cases`, with `mod_x` calculated as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`. Each count represents the number of times a particular pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been observed across the array elements.
