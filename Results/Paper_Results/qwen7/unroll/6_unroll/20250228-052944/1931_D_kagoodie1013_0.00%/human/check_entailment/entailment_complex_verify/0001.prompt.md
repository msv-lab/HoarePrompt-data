You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    return results
    #The program returns a list 'results' where each element is the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) found in the corresponding 'arr' for each 'test_case', with mod_x calculated as -num % x and mod_y as num % y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of an array, two integers (x and y), and the array elements. For each test case, it calculates the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) for each element in the array, with mod_x being -num % x and mod_y being num % y. It then appends these counts to a results list, which it returns.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
2. **Test Case Parsing**: It parses each test case correctly, extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. **Function Call**: The parsed test cases are passed to the function `func_1` which is responsible for calculating the number of beautiful pairs.
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes counters and maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y`.
   - It iterates through each number in the array, calculates its modulus with `x` and `y`, and updates the counts in the respective maps.
   - For each number, it checks how many previously seen numbers satisfy the conditions for being a "beautiful pair" and increments the count accordingly.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the `results` list and returns the list after processing all test cases.
5. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs based on the provided problem statement.
