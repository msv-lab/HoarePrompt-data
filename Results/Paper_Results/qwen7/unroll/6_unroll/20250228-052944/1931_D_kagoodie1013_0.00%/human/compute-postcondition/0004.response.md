Output State: **The program returns a list 'results' where each element is the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) found in the corresponding 'arr' for each 'test_case', with mod_x calculated as -num % x and mod_y as num % y.**

This means that for each test case, the program calculates the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) based on the given conditions and stores these counts in a list called 'results'. Each element in 'results' corresponds to the count from one of the test cases.
