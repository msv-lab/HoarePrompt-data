You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list where each element is the count of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` found in the corresponding `arr` for each `test_case`, with `mod_x` calculated as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list 'results' where each element is the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) found in the corresponding 'arr' for each 'test_case', with mod_x calculated as -num % x and mod_y as num % y.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each test case, the function returns a list results where each element is the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) found in the corresponding arr. mod_x is calculated as -num % x and mod_y as num % y.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'results' where each element is the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) found in the corresponding 'arr' for each 'test_case', with mod_x calculated as -num % x and mod_y as num % y.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
