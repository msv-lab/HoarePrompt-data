test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
