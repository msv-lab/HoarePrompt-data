### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
   - This part is correct and handled properly.

2. **Test Case Parsing**:
   - It parses each test case correctly, extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - This part is also correct and handled properly.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The parsed test cases are passed to the function `func_1` which is responsible for calculating the number of beautiful pairs.
   - This part is correct and handled properly.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes counters and maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y`.
   - It iterates through each number in the array, calculates its modulus with `x` and `y`, and updates the counts in the respective maps.
   - Here lies the issue: the calculation of `mod_x` should be `-num % x` to ensure non-negative results. However, the actual calculation used is `-num % x`, which can lead to incorrect results for negative numbers. Specifically, `-num % x` will yield a negative result when `num` is positive, which can cause incorrect matches in the `mod_x_map`.

   - For each number, it checks how many previously seen numbers satisfy the conditions for being a "beautiful pair" and increments the count accordingly.
   - The logic for checking the conditions is correct: `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the `results` list and returns the list after processing all test cases.
   - This part is mostly correct but is affected by the issue mentioned above.

5. **Output**:
   - The results are printed in the required format.
   - This part is correct and handled properly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct but overlooks the potential issue with the calculation of `mod_x`. The current implementation uses `-num % x`, which can yield negative results for positive `num`, leading to incorrect matches in the `mod_x_map`. To fix this, the calculation should be adjusted to ensure non-negative results, such as using `(-num - x) % x` instead of `-num % x`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
