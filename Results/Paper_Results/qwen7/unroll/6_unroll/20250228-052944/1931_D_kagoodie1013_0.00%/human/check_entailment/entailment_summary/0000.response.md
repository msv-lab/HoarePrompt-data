Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the necessary parameters (n, x, y, and the array).
3. The function `func_1` iterates through each element in the array and calculates the modulus values for x and y as specified.
4. It uses dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of these modulus values.
5. For each element, it increments the count of beautiful pairs based on the current modulus values and the previously seen modulus values stored in the dictionaries.
6. Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and returns it.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the logic appears to be correct. The program follows the steps outlined in the problem description and should produce the correct number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
