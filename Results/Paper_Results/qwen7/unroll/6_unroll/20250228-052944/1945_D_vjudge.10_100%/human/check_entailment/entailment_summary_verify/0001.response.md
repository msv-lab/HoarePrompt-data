### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Recap
- We need to help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- The cost to move from position `j` to `i` (where `j < i`) is `a[j]` initially, and for each intermediate position `k` (where `j < k < i`), the cost is `b[k]`.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function `func_1` processes two lists, `a` and `b`, of non-negative integers of length `n`.
- It calculates a cumulative sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`.
- It finds the minimum value of a modified `pergunta` variable, which is updated based on the cumulative sum and elements of list `a` up to index `m-1`.
- Finally, it prints and returns the minimum value of `pergunta` after processing.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized to infinity (`float('inf')`).
   - `x` is initialized to 0, representing the accumulated cost.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost to move from position `j` to `i` is calculated correctly using the cumulative sum `x` and the cost `a[i]`.
   - The cost to move through intermediate positions `k` (where `j < k < i`) is handled by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `i` might be out of bounds for `m` by only updating `pergunta` when `i < m`.

#### Verification
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function.
- The logic in the loop correctly accumulates the costs and updates `pergunta` to find the minimum cost.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and aligns with the function summary.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
