### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves performing `k` operations on an array `a` of length `n`, where in each operation, a contiguous subarray's sum can be inserted into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after these operations.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the array's sum. However, the problem simplifies when considering that the optimal strategy often involves using the largest possible positive sums and ignoring negative sums unless they help in forming larger positive sums.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - It calculates the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) under certain conditions (ignoring negative contributions unless they help form a larger positive sum).
   - It then computes the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - `2 ** k * maxi`: This term represents the contribution of the maximum subarray sum if it were to be duplicated `2 ** k` times.
   - `- maxi`: This subtracts the original maximum subarray sum to avoid double-counting.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the sum of the original array to account for the remaining elements.
   - `% 1000000007`: This ensures the result fits within the required modulo.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like empty subarrays and negative contributions correctly.
   - The logic for calculating `maxi` ensures that only beneficial subarrays are considered.

6. **Execution States**:
   - The provided annotated program matches the problem description and the expected behavior for the given examples.
