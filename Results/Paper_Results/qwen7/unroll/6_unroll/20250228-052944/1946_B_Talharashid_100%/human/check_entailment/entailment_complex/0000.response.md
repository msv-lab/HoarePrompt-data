Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation allows inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The solution aims to maximize the sum by strategically choosing the largest possible sums from subarrays.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The core logic in the provided code is to calculate the maximum contiguous subarray sum (`maxi`) under certain conditions.
   - The formula used in the solution is \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\).

3. **Formula Explanation**:
   - **\(2^k \times \text{maxi}\)**: This term represents the contribution of the maximum subarray sum when it is inserted `2^k` times.
   - **\(-\text{maxi}\)**: This subtraction accounts for the double counting of the maximum subarray sum.
   - **\(\text{sum}(l)\)**: This term adds the original sum of the array.
   - **Modulo \(1000000007\)**: Ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as handling negative numbers and ensuring the sum of the array is computed accurately.
   - The use of modulo ensures the result is within the required bounds.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including negative numbers, large arrays, and different values of `k`.
   - The output matches the expected results based on the given formula and logic.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Correctness: **True**
