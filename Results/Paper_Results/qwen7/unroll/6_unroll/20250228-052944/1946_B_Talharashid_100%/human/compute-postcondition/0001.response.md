Output State: The output state is a list of results, each result being the outcome of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for each test case, where `maxi` is the maximum sum of consecutive elements in the list `l` under certain conditions, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Each result is computed modulo \(1000000007\).
