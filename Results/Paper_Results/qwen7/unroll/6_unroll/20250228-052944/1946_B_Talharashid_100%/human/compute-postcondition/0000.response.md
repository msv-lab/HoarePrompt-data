Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop will read an input value for `i`, and this value should match the initial value of `t`, we need to ensure that the input matches `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input will be `t`, and `i` will be initialized to `t`.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is equal to `t`

So, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `t`**.
