Output State: The output state is a list of results, each result being the value printed for each test case after executing the given loop. Each result is calculated as \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\), where \(\text{maxi}\) is the maximum contiguous subarray sum under certain conditions, and \(\text{sum}(l)\) is the sum of the list \(l\).
