The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum contiguous subarray sum under specific conditions and then computes a value based on this maximum sum, the integer `k`, and the sum of the list `l`. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the value \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\), where \(\text{maxi}\) is the maximum contiguous subarray sum.
