You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

    #State: Output State: The output state is a list of results, each result being the value printed for each test case after executing the given loop. Each result is calculated as \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\), where \(\text{maxi}\) is the maximum contiguous subarray sum under certain conditions, and \(\text{sum}(l)\) is the sum of the list \(l\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum contiguous subarray sum under specific conditions and then computes a value based on this maximum sum, the integer `k`, and the sum of the list `l`. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the value \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\), where \(\text{maxi}\) is the maximum contiguous subarray sum.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `l`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `c` is initialized to 0, which seems to be used to track a cumulative sum.
   - `maxi` is also initialized to 0, which will store the maximum sum encountered during the iteration.

3. **Iterating Over the Array:**
   - The program iterates over each element `ele` in the array `l`.
   - If `ele` is negative and the current cumulative sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it updates `maxi` and resets `c` to 0.
   - Otherwise, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` with the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

4. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, `maxi` is updated again with the final value of `c` to ensure it captures the last cumulative sum.

5. **Calculation and Output:**
   - The program calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula seems to be derived from the problem statement but let's verify it.

### Verification of the Formula

The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` needs to be verified against the problem requirements.

- **Explanation of the Formula:**
  - `2 ** k * maxi`: This part suggests that we are adding the maximum prefix sum `maxi` multiple times, effectively extending the array.
  - `- maxi`: This subtraction might be to adjust for over-counting or to handle edge cases.
  - `+ sum(l)`: Adding the original sum of the array.
  - `% 1000000007`: Taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

### Edge Cases and Test Cases

Let's consider some edge cases and test cases to validate the solution:

1. **Empty Subarray Insertion:**
   - If `k` is large enough, inserting the sum of an empty subarray (`0`) multiple times should not change the sum significantly, as long as the original array has positive elements.

2. **Negative Elements:**
   - The logic to handle negative elements seems correct, as it ensures that only beneficial subarrays are considered.

3. **Large `k`:**
   - For large `k`, the formula should work as intended, as it allows for significant increases in the array sum through repeated insertions.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and the formula, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the array sum after `k` operations. The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` seems to be a valid approach to solve the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
