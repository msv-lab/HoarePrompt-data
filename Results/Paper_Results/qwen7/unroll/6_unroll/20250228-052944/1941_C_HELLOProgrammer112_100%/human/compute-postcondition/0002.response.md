Output State: The output state is a collection of integers, where each integer represents the result of the expression `x + y - z` for each test case. Here, `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring "map", `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring "pie", and `z` is the count of occurrences of the substring "mapie". Each result is printed on a new line after processing all the substrings in the input string `s` for a particular test case.
