Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program counts occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping substrings or the removal of characters in a way that minimizes the deletions. For example, in the input "mapie", the program would incorrectly count two occurrences of "map" and one of "pie", leading to a deletion count of 3 instead of the correct minimum of 2 (by deleting the 'a' and 'e').
