Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It returns the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the given number of extroverts and universals under specific conditions, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them.**

- If the conditions are not met, the function returns None.
- Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of the division of `(extroverts + universals)` by 3 if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, it returns None.
