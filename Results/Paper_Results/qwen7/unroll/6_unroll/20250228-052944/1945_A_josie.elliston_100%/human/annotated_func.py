#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. The function returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to the specified conditions, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, and `universals` is a non-negative integer. The number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3
    #State: Postcondition: `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers. If the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, the function calculates the minimum number of tents required. Otherwise, the function returns None.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling value of the division of (extroverts + universals) by 3 if extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of extroverts % 3 and universals is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It checks if the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and if the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3. If these conditions are met, it returns the ceiling value of the division of `(extroverts + universals)` by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents required. Otherwise, it returns `None`, indicating it is impossible to accommodate them under the specified conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts, extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns `introverts` plus the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` does not return `None`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, all of which are non-negative integers. It calls another function `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns a value other than `None`, the function returns the sum of `introverts` and the returned value from `func_1`. Otherwise, it returns `-1`.
