Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed because it does not properly calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the given rules. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program calculates the penalty based on the difference between the number of '+' and '-' in the string. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

2. **Splitting Strategy**: The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not consider different ways to split the array to achieve this.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly. For example, it does not consider the scenario where the number of '-' equals the number of '+', which should result in a penalty of zero as shown in the third test case.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one needs to consider dynamic programming or a greedy approach to find the optimal way to split the array. Here's a more appropriate solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Count the number of '-' in the string
    neg_count = s.count('-')
    # Calculate the minimum penalty
    min_penalty = n - 2 * neg_count if n != neg_count else 0
    print(min_penalty)
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum penalty by counting the number of '-' in the string and then determining the minimum penalty based on the given conditions.
