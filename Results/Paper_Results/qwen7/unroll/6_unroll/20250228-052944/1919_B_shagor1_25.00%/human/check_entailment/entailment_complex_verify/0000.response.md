### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array \(a\) into non-empty subarrays \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k\).
- The penalty for a subarray \(c\) of length \(m\) is given by \(p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_m| \cdot m\).
- The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the string \(s\).
- It counts the number of '-' characters in \(s\) and stores it in `neg`.
- It then prints \(n - 2 \times \text{neg}\) if \(n \neq \text{neg}\), otherwise it prints \(n\).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Penalty Calculation**: The program calculates the penalty based on the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. This approach does not necessarily yield the minimum possible penalty because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array.
2. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into segments such that the sum of each segment is zero or close to zero, minimizing the penalty. The program does not implement this logic.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
- The program calculates \(n = 10\) and \(\text{neg} = 8\).
- It prints \(10 - 2 \times 8 = 2\).

However, the optimal split is:
- \([--]\): Sum = -2, Penalty = 2 * 2 = 4
- \([++++++]\): Sum = 6, Penalty = 6 * 7 = 42
- \([-]\): Sum = -1, Penalty = 1 * 1 = 1

Total penalty = 4 + 42 + 1 = 47, not 2.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty. The provided solution only considers the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the optimal approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
