Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information related to the test case, adhering to the constraints provided.
