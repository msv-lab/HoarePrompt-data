Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying segments where the array elements are already equal and calculating the cost of making the entire array uniform. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically:

1. **Initial Checks**: The program checks for consecutive equal elements at the start (`st`) and end (`end`) of the array but does not correctly account for these segments when calculating the minimum cost.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic is incorrect. The program tries to find the minimum segment that needs to be changed to make all elements equal but does not handle the general case correctly.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when the array is already uniform or when there are multiple segments of unequal elements.

Given the execution summary and the problem statement, the program should identify the longest segment of the array where all elements are the same and calculate the cost of changing the rest of the array to match that segment. The current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

Correctness: **False**
