Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the maximum value calculated based on the conditions given in the loop body. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
