Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- After the loop executes all iterations, there will be `t` pairs \((a, b)\) stored in memory.
- Additionally, it is stated that \((a + b)\) is not even for all pairs \((a, b)\).

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('alice')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **alice**
