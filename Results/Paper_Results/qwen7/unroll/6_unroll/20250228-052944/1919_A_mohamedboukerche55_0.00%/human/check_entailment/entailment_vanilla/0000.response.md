Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads a string `s` using `input()`, which is supposed to be the space-separated values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program splits the string `s` by spaces and converts the first element to an integer `a` and the second element to an integer `b`.
   - This part of the code is correct as long as the input format is strictly followed (i.e., two integers separated by a space).

3. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'alice'.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - According to the problem, the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - The key observation here is that the game essentially boils down to determining whether the sum of the initial coins in both wallets is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, Bob will always win because he can always force the sum to become odd after his move, ensuring Alice eventually faces a situation where she cannot make a valid move.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice will always win because she can always force the sum to become even after her move, ensuring Bob eventually faces a situation where he cannot make a valid move.

### Verification:

- For the example test cases provided:
  - Case 1: `1 1` → Sum is even (`2`), Bob wins.
  - Case 2: `1 4` → Sum is odd (`5`), Alice wins.
  - Case 3: `5 3` → Sum is even (`8`), Bob wins.
  - Case 4: `4 5` → Sum is odd (`9`), Alice wins.
  - Case 5: `11 9` → Sum is even (`20`), Bob wins.
  - Case 6: `83 91` → Sum is odd (`174`), Alice wins.
  - Case 7: `1032 9307` → Sum is even (`10339`), Bob wins.
  - Case 8: `839204 7281` → Sum is odd (`846485`), Alice wins.
  - Case 9: `1000000000 1000000000` → Sum is even (`2000000000`), Bob wins.
  - Case 10: `53110 2024` → Sum is even (`55134`), Bob wins.

The program correctly implements the logic based on the sum being even or odd. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
