You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5

    839204 7281
    
    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, with the additional information that after the loop executes all iterations, there will be t pairs (a, b) stored in memory.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: 'bob  '
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. After the loop executes all iterations, there will be t pairs (a, b) stored in memory. If the sum of a and b is even, the sum is handled accordingly in the if part. If the sum of a and b is not even, the sum is handled accordingly in the else part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
   - Inside the loop, it reads a string `s` using `input()`, which is supposed to be the space-separated values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program splits the string `s` by spaces and converts the first element to an integer `a` and the second element to an integer `b`.
   - This part of the code is correct as long as the input format is strictly followed (i.e., two integers separated by a space).

3. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'alice'.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - According to the problem, the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - The key observation here is that the game essentially boils down to determining whether the sum of the initial coins in both wallets is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, Bob will always win because he can always force the sum to become odd after his move, ensuring Alice eventually faces a situation where she cannot make a valid move.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice will always win because she can always force the sum to become even after her move, ensuring Bob eventually faces a situation where he cannot make a valid move.

### Verification:

- For the example test cases provided:
  - Case 1: `1 1` → Sum is even (`2`), Bob wins.
  - Case 2: `1 4` → Sum is odd (`5`), Alice wins.
  - Case 3: `5 3` → Sum is even (`8`), Bob wins.
  - Case 4: `4 5` → Sum is odd (`9`), Alice wins.
  - Case 5: `11 9` → Sum is even (`20`), Bob wins.
  - Case 6: `83 91` → Sum is odd (`174`), Alice wins.
  - Case 7: `1032 9307` → Sum is even (`10339`), Bob wins.
  - Case 8: `839204 7281` → Sum is odd (`846485`), Alice wins.
  - Case 9: `1000000000 1000000000` → Sum is even (`2000000000`), Bob wins.
  - Case 10: `53110 2024` → Sum is even (`55134`), Bob wins.

The program correctly implements the logic based on the sum being even or odd. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
