Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
- After the loop executes all iterations, there will be `t` pairs \((a, b)\) stored in memory.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even for each pair.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'bob  '`.

Output: **'bob  '**
