### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a logical error in the peak condition check. The condition `a < b > c` is not correctly implemented. The correct condition for a peak should be `a < b and b > c`. The current implementation uses the chained comparison `a < b > c`, which is equivalent to `(a < b) and (b > c)` in Python, but the issue lies in the way the conditions are combined.

In the current implementation:
- `a < b > c` is evaluated as `(a < b) and (b > c)`, which is logically correct.
- However, the problem statement specifies `a < b > c` as a condition, which might imply a different interpretation or order of operations that the current implementation does not fully capture.

Given the problem statement and the example inputs, the current implementation should work correctly because the chained comparison `a < b > c` is indeed equivalent to `a < b and b > c`.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate because the current implementation correctly handles the conditions as specified in the problem statement. The chained comparison `a < b > c` is logically equivalent to `a < b and b > c`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.
