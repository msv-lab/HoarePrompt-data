Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the conditions for a stair are met, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the conditions for a peak are met, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in the program matches the requirements exactly. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code.

Correctness: **True**
