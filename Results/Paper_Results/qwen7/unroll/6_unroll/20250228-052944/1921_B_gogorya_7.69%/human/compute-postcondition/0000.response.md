Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. All other variables (`n`, `s`, and `f`) are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their initial state as described.
