State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable in the `for` loop, typically representing the index or the value from `range(t)`.
- Since the loop runs `t` times, the initial value of `_` should be 1 (the first iteration).
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run, so it must be an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
