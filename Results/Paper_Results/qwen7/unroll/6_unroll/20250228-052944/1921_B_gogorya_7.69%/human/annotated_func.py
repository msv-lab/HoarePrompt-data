#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: t is the number of test cases, for each test case, n is the length of the binary strings s1 and s2, s1 and s2 are binary strings, res is the final result after executing the loop, which represents the maximum number of positions where s1 has a '1' and s2 has a '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and two binary strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to transform the initial configuration `s1` into the desired configuration `s2`. The function outputs the total count of positions where `s1` has a '1' and `s2` has a '0', indicating the maximum number of positions that can be successfully transformed within `t` moves. If the transformation is not possible within `t` moves, it outputs a value reflecting the impossibility of the transformation.
