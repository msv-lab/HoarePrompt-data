Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation, where the cost of the operation is the length of the subarray being modified. The objective is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it first checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `0` because no operation is needed.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the length of the longest consecutive sequence of the same number in the original array (`cn`) and in the reversed array (`ck`).
   - If the first elements of the longest consecutive sequences in the original and reversed arrays are the same, it adds `ck` to `cn`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the array minus the maximum of `cn` and `ck`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is uniform and printing `0` if it is correct.
   - The calculation of `cn` and `ck` is also correct as it identifies the longest consecutive sequences.
   - The addition of `ck` to `cn` when the first elements match ensures that we consider the possibility of merging these sequences into a single operation.
   - The final calculation of `n - max(cn, ck)` is correct as it gives the minimum cost to make the array uniform.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
