Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic implemented in the function `func()` is flawed and does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operation.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The code does not properly handle the operation of setting a subarray to a single value. Instead, it tries to find consecutive identical elements and calculates the cost based on those sequences, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Cost**: The logic to find the minimum cost should involve finding the optimal segment to change to a common value. The current implementation does not consider all possible segments and their costs.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the array might need to be changed in multiple segments to achieve uniformity, and it does not account for the cost of each operation.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. This involves identifying the optimal segment to change and calculating the cost accordingly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def min_cost_to_equalize(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate over all possible values that the array can be set to
    for val in range(1, n + 1):
        cost = 0
        start = 0
        while start < n:
            end = start
            while end < n and arr[end] == val:
                end += 1
            if end - start > 0:
                cost += (end - start)
            start = end
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        print(min_cost_to_equalize(arr))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible values that the array can be set to and calculates the cost for each possible segment where the array can be made uniform. It then returns the minimum cost among these possibilities.
