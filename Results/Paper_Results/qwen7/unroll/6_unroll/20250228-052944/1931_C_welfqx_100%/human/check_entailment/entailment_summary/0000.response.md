Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking for consecutive duplicates and calculating the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. However, there are some issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Handling Single Element or No Consecutive Duplicates**: The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element or no consecutive duplicates by printing `0`.
2. **Longest Consecutive Sequences**: The program tries to find the longest consecutive sequences in both the original and reversed arrays. This part of the logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal with just one operation.
3. **Summing Lengths**: The program incorrectly sums the lengths of the longest consecutive sequences in the original and reversed arrays. This approach does not guarantee the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array has a mix of elements that can be made equal with one operation but the current logic fails to identify this.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
