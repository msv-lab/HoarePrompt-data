Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then checks if the list contains any consecutive duplicates. If the list has only one element or no consecutive duplicates, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the lengths of the longest consecutive sequences in both the original and reversed lists, sums these lengths if the first elements of both sequences are the same, and prints the difference between the length of the list and this sum.**
