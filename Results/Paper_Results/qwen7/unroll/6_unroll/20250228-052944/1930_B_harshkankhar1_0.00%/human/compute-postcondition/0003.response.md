Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case has a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function processes t and n and returns specific outputs based on the given conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not specified in the given information, only the constraints and input conditions for the function.
