Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The key issue lies in the logic used to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

- The program checks only the second last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`). This check is insufficient because the robot's path depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows, not just the second last one.
- The program should simulate the robot's movement through the grid according to the given rules and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
- The current implementation assumes that if the second last arrow in the second row is `>` (pointing right), the robot can always reach (2, n), which is not necessarily true due to the presence of arrows in the first row.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step for each test case, considering the arrows in both rows.

Correctness: **False**
