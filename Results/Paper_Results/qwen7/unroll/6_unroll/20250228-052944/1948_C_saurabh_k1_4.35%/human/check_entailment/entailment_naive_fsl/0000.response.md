Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks only the second-to-last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This check is insufficient because the robot's movement depends on both the direction of the arrows in the current cell and the subsequent cells it might move to.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
In this case, the program would incorrectly output "Yes" because it only checks `b[2]` which is `'>'`. However, the robot's path would be as follows:
1. Start at (1, 1) -> Move right to (1, 2) -> Move left to (1, 1) -> Move down to (2, 1) -> Move right to (2, 2) -> Move left to (2, 1) -> Move down to (2, 2) -> Move right to (2, 3) -> Move left to (2, 2) -> Move down to (2, 3) -> Move right to (2, 4).

Since the robot cannot reach (2, 4), the program should output "No". However, the current implementation fails to account for the full path the robot takes, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
