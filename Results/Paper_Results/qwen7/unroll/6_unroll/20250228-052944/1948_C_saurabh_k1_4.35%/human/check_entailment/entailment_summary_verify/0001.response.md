### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program has a logical flaw. The program only checks if the second-to-last character in the second row is `>` and prints 'Yes' if it is, and 'No' otherwise. This approach is indeed insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

To properly solve this problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and ensure that it can reach the target cell by following the arrows correctly. The given program fails to do this because it does not account for the sequence of movements required to reach the target cell.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Logical Flaw**: The program only checks one specific condition (`b[n - 2] == '>'`), which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. The robot's movement depends on the sequence of arrows, not just a single condition.

2. **Path Validation**: The program does not validate the entire path from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)`. It should simulate the robot's movement step by step and ensure that it can follow the arrows correctly to reach the target cell.

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement and ensure that it can follow the arrows to reach the target cell. This involves iterating through the grid and checking the sequence of movements.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly validate the entire path.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly validate the entire path from the starting cell to the target cell.
