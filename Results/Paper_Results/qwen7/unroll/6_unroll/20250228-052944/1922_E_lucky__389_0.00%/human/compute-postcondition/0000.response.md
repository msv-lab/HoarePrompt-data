Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18 (input value)**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The value of `x` is set to the integer input provided by the user, which is constrained to be between 2 and \(10^{18}\).
