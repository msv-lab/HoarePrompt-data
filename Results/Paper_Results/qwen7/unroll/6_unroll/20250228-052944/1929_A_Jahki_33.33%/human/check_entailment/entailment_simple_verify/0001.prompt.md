You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array elements, and num2 is not used in the function and can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, and order is the number of adjacent swaps needed to sort the list in non-decreasing order.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \cdots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Checking Initial Order:**
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0 because the sum of differences will be zero.

3. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty:**
   - If the array is not in non-decreasing order, the program sorts the array.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Initial Check with `func_1`:**
   - This check is unnecessary because sorting the array will always yield the maximum possible beauty, regardless of the initial order.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, sorting it again will not change anything, and the beauty will still be zero.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After sorting, the beauty is correctly calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the given program is correct.
