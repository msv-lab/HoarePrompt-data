### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and the proposed solution:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. This check is unnecessary and misleading because it incorrectly assumes that the array must be sorted to achieve the maximum beauty. In fact, the maximum beauty is achieved by strategically rearranging the elements.

2. **Main Logic Issue:**
   - The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. While sorting helps in identifying the smallest and largest values, simply calculating the difference between consecutive elements does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. The correct approach is to place the smallest and largest values alternately to maximize the differences.

The proposed corrected version of the program is indeed correct. Here's why:

- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array helps in easily identifying the smallest and largest values.
  
- **Alternating Placement:**
  - By placing the smallest and largest values alternately, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 4, 2, 3]` to maximize the beauty.

- **Handling Odd Length Arrays:**
  - If the array length is odd, the middle element is added separately to ensure all elements are considered.

Thus, the corrected program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by strategically rearranging its elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program, after correction, is now correct and accurately calculates the maximum beauty of the array.
