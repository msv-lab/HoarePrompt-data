Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Space Occupied by Icons**: The calculation of `space_x` and `space_y` does not correctly reflect the space occupied by the icons. Specifically, `space_x` should be `x` (since each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell), and `space_y` should be `y * 4` (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells**: The calculation of `remaining_cells` is incorrect. It should be calculated based on the total capacity of the screens minus the space already occupied by the 2x2 icons.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Number of Screens**: The logic for determining the number of screens needed is flawed. It does not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons within the available space after placing the 2x2 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Total capacity of one screen
        screen_capacity = 5 * 3
        # Space occupied by 2x2 icons
        space_occupied_by_2x2 = y * 4
        # Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = screen_capacity * (y // 2 + (1 if y % 2 != 0 else 0)) - space_occupied_by_2x2
        # Number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        screens_needed_for_1x1 = (x + remaining_space - 1) // remaining_space
        # Total number of screens
        total_screens = y // 2 + (1 if y % 2 != 0 else 0) + screens_needed_for_1x1
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the calculations and logic are accurate and align with the problem requirements.
