Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of integers `a` (length `n`, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each of the `n` piles. The function processes each test case and returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters (`t`, `n`, and a list `a`). It processes these inputs to perform some operation or calculation and returns the result accordingly.
