Postcondition: **`cw` is False, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is initially from the original list minus `ls`, and `nw` remains True.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, `cw` will always be set to False by the end of the if-else block. The other variables (`ls`, `t`, `N`, `nums`, and `nw`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
