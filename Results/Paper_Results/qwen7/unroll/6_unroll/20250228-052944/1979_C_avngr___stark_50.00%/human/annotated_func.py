#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list numbers contains n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers named 'numbers'. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers in the list without leaving a remainder.
