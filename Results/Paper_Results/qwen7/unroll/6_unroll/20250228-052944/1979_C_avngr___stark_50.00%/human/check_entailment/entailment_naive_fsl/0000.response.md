Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the multipliers and then divides each multiplier by the HCF to get the bet amounts. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of the bet amounts will be strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:
- `n = 2`
- `k = [3, 3]`

According to the problem description, we need to find bets \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) such that:
\[ x_1 + x_2 < 3x_1 \quad \text{and} \quad x_1 + x_2 < 3x_2 \]

If we follow the program's logic:
- The HCF of 3 and 3 is 3.
- The program calculates \(c = [1, 1]\).

However, the sum of the bets \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is not strictly less than \(3 \times 1 = 3\). Therefore, the program fails to provide a valid distribution of bets for this case.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
