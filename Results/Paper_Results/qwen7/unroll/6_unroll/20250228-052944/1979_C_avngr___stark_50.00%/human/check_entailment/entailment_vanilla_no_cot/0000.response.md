Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. However, the problem requires that the total amount bet should be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Simply multiplying all `k_i` together does not ensure this condition.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is correct but it's not used appropriately in the main program. The GCD calculation is unnecessary for the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing Bets:**
   - The program incorrectly checks if `sum(c) >= m / hcf` to determine if the solution is valid. This check is flawed because it doesn't account for the requirement that the total bet must be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

### Corrected Program:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the minimum bet required for each outcome
    min_bets = [1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        min_bets[i] = (k[i] - 1) // sum(k) + 1
    
    # Check if a valid distribution exists
    total_bet = sum(min_bets)
    if total_bet >= max(k):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for bet in min_bets:
            print(bet, end=' ')
        print('')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Calculate Minimum Bets:** For each outcome, calculate the minimum bet required such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for that outcome.
- **Check Validity:** Sum the minimum bets and check if it is less than the maximum payout. If so, print the bets; otherwise, print `-1`.

This approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any winning outcome.
