You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m = m * k[i]
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(int(m / k[i]))
    hcf = func_1(c)
    for i in range(n):
        c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
    if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')

def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers named 'numbers'. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The GCD is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers in the list without leaving a remainder.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculation of Total Bet:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This is done using the line `m = m * k[i]`.

3. **Calculation of Individual Bets:**
   - It computes the individual bets `c[i]` as `m / k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the return would be `k[i] * c[i]`, which equals `m`.

4. **Finding HCF:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to find the highest common factor (HCF) of the calculated bets `c[i]`. This is done using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the HCF of the list of numbers.

5. **Adjusting Bets Based on HCF:**
   - The program divides each element in `c` by the HCF to get the adjusted bets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the adjusted bets is less than or equal to `m / hcf`. If true, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.

6. **Printing Adjusted Bets:**
   - If the sum of the adjusted bets is less than `m / hcf`, the program prints the adjusted bets.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where the sum of the adjusted bets is greater than or equal to `m / hcf` correctly by printing `-1`.
  - The program ensures that the bets are integers within the specified range (`1 <= x_i <= 10^9`).

- **Algorithm Logic:**
  - The logic of calculating the product `m` and distributing the bets based on the HCF is sound.
  - The use of the HCF helps in scaling down the bets to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the condition that the sum of bets is less than the return value for any winning outcome.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly computes the HCF of the list of numbers using the `gcd` function.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
