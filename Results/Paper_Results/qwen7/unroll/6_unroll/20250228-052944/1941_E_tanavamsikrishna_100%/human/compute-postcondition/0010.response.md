Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `row`, a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and `d`, a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between supports. It returns the last element of the list `row`, which is the sum of the initial value (3) plus 1 for each iteration it was updated.**
