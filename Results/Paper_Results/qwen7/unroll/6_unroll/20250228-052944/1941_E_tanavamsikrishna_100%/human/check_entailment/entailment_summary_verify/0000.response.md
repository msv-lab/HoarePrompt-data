### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row of the river, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Initialization and Update Logic**:
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row to ensure that a support is placed at the start and end of the row.
   - It then uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain point. This is a good idea, but the logic for updating the heap and placing supports is flawed.

2. **Heap Operations**:
   - The function uses a min-heap to store the minimum cost up to a certain point. However, it does not correctly update the heap to reflect the actual cost of placing supports in all valid positions.
   - The while loop inside the main loop is not correctly handling the removal of outdated entries from the heap, which means the heap might contain invalid or outdated costs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where placing supports closer together might result in a lower total cost. For example, if the depths in the row are such that placing supports closer together results in a lower total cost, the current implementation might not consider this.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
The function `func_2` is responsible for processing the entire input and calculating the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges. Here are the key points:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads the dimensions of the river and the depths of each cell correctly.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports in that row.
   - It then calculates the sum of the costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum total cost, which is correct according to the problem statement.

#### Correctness of the Overall Program:
- While `func_2` appears to be correct in terms of reading input and calculating the minimum total cost, the issue lies in `func_1`. The logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints. This means that even though `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1`, the results from `func_1` are incorrect.

Given these observations, the overall program is not correct because the core function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic for placing supports. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints.
