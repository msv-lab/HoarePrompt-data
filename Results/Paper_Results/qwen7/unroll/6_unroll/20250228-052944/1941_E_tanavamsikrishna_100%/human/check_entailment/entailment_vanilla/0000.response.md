Let's break down the solution to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row of the river.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports within the specified distance `d`.
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of `1`, `2`, ..., `d+1`.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the row, maintaining the heap to ensure the minimum cost is always considered for placing supports.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire input.
   - It reads the dimensions of the river (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of each row (`rows`).
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports in that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to place supports with the minimum cost in a single row.
   - The function `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each row and then finds the optimal set of `k` consecutive rows to minimize the total cost.

### Testing the Functions:

To validate the correctness, we need to consider the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3 11 1 4
  0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
  0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
  0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  4
  ```

- Explanation:
  - For the first row: The minimum cost is calculated as follows:
    - Initialize: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
    - Update: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
    - Final cost: `4`
  - The same process is applied to the other rows, and the minimum cost for the first row is `4`.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  4 4 2 1
  0 3 3 0
  0 2 1 0
  0 1 2 0
  0 3 3 0
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  8
  ```

- Explanation:
  - For the first two rows: The minimum cost is calculated as follows:
    - Row 1: `[1, 4, 5, 1]` (cost: `8`)
    - Row 2: `[1, 3, 4, 1]` (cost: `8`)
  - The total cost for the first two rows is `8`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the examples provided, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports for the given constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
