Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be within the valid range defined by `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Initial values and adjustments needed**:
   - `total_costs` is an empty list and does not affect the loop condition.
   - `n` is the number of rows, but it is not directly used in the loop condition.
   - `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values and do not affect the loop condition.
   - `rows` is a list of lists containing integers, but it is not directly used in the loop condition.
   - `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is 0 or some value that allows the loop to start executing.
   - The length of `costs` minus `(k - 1)` should be a positive integer to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that the loop can start executing. This means setting `i` to 0 and ensuring that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be a positive integer**
