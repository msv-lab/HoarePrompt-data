Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `n` is the number of rows, `m` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `d` retains its original value, `rows` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers corresponding to the input split by spaces for each row, and `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. This means that `total_costs` now exists as an empty list, while all other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) retain their original values from the initial state.
