The function accepts a list of integers `row` representing the depths of river cells in a single row and a positive integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between supports. It updates the values in `row` based on a minimum heap operation, ensuring that each element is adjusted according to certain conditions. Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row`, which is the sum of an initial value (3) plus 1 for each iteration it was updated.
