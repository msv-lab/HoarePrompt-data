### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the solution and validates the logic implemented in both `func_1` and `func_2`. However, there are a few points to consider for a thorough evaluation:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements with increasing costs starting from `1`.
   - It maintains a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports within the specified distance `d`.
   - The function updates the row costs and ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly processes the input dimensions and the depths of each row.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports in that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_2`:

- The function `func_2` should calculate the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the rows, but it incorrectly calculates the total cost by simply summing the costs of the rows without considering the actual placement of supports within the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row.
   - The logic for updating the costs and maintaining the heap is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports in that row.
   - The function then calculates the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the rows, which is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:

The function `func_2` should calculate the total cost for placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by considering the actual placement of supports within the constraints. Specifically, it should sum the costs of the rows and then apply the logic of placing supports within the constraints to ensure the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the correct logic for `func_1` and the overall approach of `func_2`. However, the implementation of `func_2` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the placement of supports within the constraints.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the total cost calculation in `func_2`.
