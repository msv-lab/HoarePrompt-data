Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river depths and ensures that supports are placed in a way that minimizes the cost while adhering to the constraints.
   - The function initializes the first element of the row to 1 and the next `d` elements to 3 (since each of these positions needs to have a support and the cost is `a_{i,j} + 1`).
   - It then uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost position to place additional supports, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function correctly updates the row based on the heap operations and returns the final cost, which is the last element of the updated row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire grid of the river, calculating the cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the minimum cost of placing `k` bridges over consecutive rows by summing the costs of the corresponding sublists of length `k` from the `costs` list.
   - The function correctly identifies the minimum total cost among all possible placements of the bridges and prints it.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, both functions appear to be implemented correctly and logically follow the requirements. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the cost for a single row, and `func_2` correctly aggregates these costs to find the minimum cost for placing `k` bridges over consecutive rows.

Therefore, the program as a whole meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
