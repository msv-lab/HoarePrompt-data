Output State: **`n` is the number of rows, `m` and `k` retain their original values, `d` retains its original value, and `rows` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers corresponding to the input split by spaces for each row.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` rows of input, where each row is a list of integers. These integers are obtained by splitting the input string by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged from the initial state. The `rows` variable is updated to a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integers from the corresponding row of input.
