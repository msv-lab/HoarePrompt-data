Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value from the list `data` at index `idx` (which is 0 initially) to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented by 1 because we have processed the first element of the list. The value of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
