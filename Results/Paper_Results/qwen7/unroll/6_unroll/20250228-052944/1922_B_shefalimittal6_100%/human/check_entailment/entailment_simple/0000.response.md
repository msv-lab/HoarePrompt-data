Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input data and processes it according to the problem statement.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the test cases.
3. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each stick length and uses these counts to calculate the number of valid triangles.
4. The logic for calculating the number of valid triangles is correct:
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of a certain length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of those sticks.
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of a certain length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of those sticks.
5. The final result is stored in the `results` list and printed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
