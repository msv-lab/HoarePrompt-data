Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified, handling multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle.
3. The logic to count the number of valid triplets is correct:
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length `i`, the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks is `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length `i`, the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks is `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
4. The variable `cnt` keeps track of the cumulative count of sticks, which helps in calculating the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from different lengths.
5. The final result is printed in the correct format, with each result on a new line.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
