Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5; the function `input` is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which means that instead of using the standard `input()` function, the program will now use `sys.stdin.read` to read input from the standard input stream. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the list `a`, nor does it affect the constraints on these variables.
