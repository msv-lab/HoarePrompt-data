Output State: **`mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` initializes the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`mx`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`). Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their respective values or conditions, plus the new value of `cur`.
