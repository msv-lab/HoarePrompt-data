Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Additionally, a is an integer calculated as the sum of f_i for all edges, s is an integer calculated as (c * i * c * m + c * a) summed from 0 to k-1 and then taken modulo M, and M is 10^9 + 7. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
