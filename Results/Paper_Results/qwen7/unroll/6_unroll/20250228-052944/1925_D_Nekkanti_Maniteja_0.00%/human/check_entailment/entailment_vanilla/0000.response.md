Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the program reads the indices `u`, `v`, and the friendship value `f`.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - It uses the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` to update `s` for each excursion.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(M\).

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `c`:**
   - The value of `c` should be the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).
   - However, the program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), which is incorrect. It should be the inverse of the total number of possible pairs.

2. **Incorrect Formula for Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions should be calculated differently. Specifically, the expected value for each pair of friends should be updated based on the probability of being chosen and the increase in friendship value.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends and then sum these expected values.

1. **Calculate the Probability of Choosing Each Pair:**
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Update the Friendship Value:**
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value for each pair of friends can be calculated as the sum of the initial friendship value plus the expected increase due to subsequent excursions.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula and an incorrect calculation of the modular multiplicative inverse. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: **False**
