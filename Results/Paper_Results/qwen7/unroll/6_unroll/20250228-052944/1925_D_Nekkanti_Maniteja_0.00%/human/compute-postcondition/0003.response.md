Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with additional integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It validates the constraints for t, n, m, and k, and processes distinct pairs of friends (a_i, b_i) with associated values f_i. The function returns results based on the validation and processing of these inputs across the test cases.**
