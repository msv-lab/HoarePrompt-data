Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not properly defined**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the logic for checking subsequences but is incomplete and incorrectly implemented.
2. **Incorrect logic for checking subsequences**: The current implementation checks if the first `k` characters of the alphabet are present in the string `s` in sequence. However, it does not check if all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.
3. **Incomplete handling of the output**: If the condition `ps >= n` is not met, the program incorrectly prints a string that is not necessarily the shortest or lexicographically smallest string that is not a subsequence.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters and check if they are subsequences of `s`. If any such string is not found, you should print "NO" followed by one such string. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def find_missing_subsequence(n, k, s):
    chars = [chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)]
    all_combinations = [''.join(p) for p in product(chars, repeat=n)]
    
    for combination in all_combinations:
        if not is_subsequence(s, combination):
            return combination
    return None

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        missing = find_missing_subsequence(n, k, s)
        if missing:
            print("NO")
            print(missing)
        else:
            print("YES")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version uses `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` and checks if they are subsequences of `s`. If a missing subsequence is found, it prints "NO" followed by the missing subsequence. If no missing subsequence is found, it prints "YES".
