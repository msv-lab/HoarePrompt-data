You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks if it contains at least `n` sets of `k` characters. If it finds at least `n` such sets, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and then constructs and prints a string based on the characters in `us` (the first `k` lowercase letters) that were not part of any complete set of `k` characters found in `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never actually called within the main loop. This is a logical error since the function should be used to process each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside the main loop, the function `func_1()` is called, but it is incorrectly defined to read and process the input directly.
   - The function `func_1()`:
     - Reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
     - Reads the string `s`.
     - Initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - Initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of characters seen so far.
     - Initializes an empty list `ans` to store characters that form a valid sequence.
     - Initializes a counter `ps` to count the number of unique characters added to `win`.

4. **Processing the String `s`:**
   - Iterates through each character `i` in `s`.
   - If `i` is in `us`, it adds `i` to `win` and increments `ps`.
   - If `win` has `k` characters, it appends `i` to `ans` and clears `win` to start a new sequence.
   - After processing the string, checks if `ps` (number of unique characters processed) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is at least `n`, prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` where `i` is the first character missing from `win`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not called correctly. It should be called inside the main loop to handle each test case.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - The logic to determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s` is flawed. The current implementation only checks if a subset of characters forms a valid sequence, but it does not ensure all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to call `func_1()` correctly and ensure the logic accurately checks for all possible subsequences of length `n`.

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Generate a counterexample
        missing_chars = us - win
        if missing_chars:
            missing_char = next(iter(missing_chars))
            print(''.join(ans) + missing_char + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program had a logical error due to incorrect function calls and flawed logic. After fixing these issues, the program should correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`.

**Correctness:** **False** (original program) **True** (corrected program)
