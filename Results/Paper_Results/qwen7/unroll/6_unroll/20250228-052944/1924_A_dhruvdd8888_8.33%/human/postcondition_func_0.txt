The function processes a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks if it contains at least `n` sets of `k` characters. If it finds at least `n` such sets, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and then constructs and prints a string based on the characters in `us` (the first `k` lowercase letters) that were not part of any complete set of `k` characters found in `s`.
