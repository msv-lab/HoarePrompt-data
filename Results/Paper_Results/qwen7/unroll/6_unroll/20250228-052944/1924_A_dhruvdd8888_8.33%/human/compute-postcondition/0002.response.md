Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'**.

This means that the set `us` now contains the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, starting from 'a'. For example, if `k` was 5, `us` would be `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}`.
