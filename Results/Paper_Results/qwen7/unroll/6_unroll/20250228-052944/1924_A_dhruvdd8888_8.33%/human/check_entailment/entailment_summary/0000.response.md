Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
3. It uses a set `us` to store the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
4. It iterates through the string `s` to find sequences of `k` distinct characters and stores these characters in the set `win`.
5. If it finds at least `n` such sequences, it prints 'YES'.
6. If not, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string based on the characters in `us` that were not part of any complete sequence of `k` characters found in `s`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

- The function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the string `s` does not contain enough unique characters to form `n` sequences of `k` characters. Specifically, the logic to construct and print the required string is flawed.
- The construction of the string in the `else` block is incorrect. It should ensure that the constructed string does not appear as a subsequence in `s`.

Given these points, let's evaluate the correctness:

1. The main logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s` is correct.
2. However, the construction of the string that is not a subsequence of `s` is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
