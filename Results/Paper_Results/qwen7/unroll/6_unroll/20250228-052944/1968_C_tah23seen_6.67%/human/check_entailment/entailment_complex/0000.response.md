Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array \(a\) of size \(n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided solution attempts to generate such an array \(a\) using the function `func_1`.
3. Let's analyze the logic inside `func_1`:
   - `ans[0]` is initialized to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element, `ans[i]` is calculated as the maximum of `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.
   - Finally, `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

4. We need to verify if this approach correctly generates an array \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions:
   - The initial value `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that \(a_1 > x_1\).
   - For each subsequent element, `ans[i]` is chosen to be at least as large as `arr[i] + ans[i-1]`, ensuring that \(a_i \geq x_i + a_{i-1}\).
   - This guarantees that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) holds true for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

5. The constraints \(1 \leq x_i \leq 500\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) are respected by the logic used in the function.

Given the above analysis, the provided function `func_1` correctly generates an array \(a\) that satisfies the required conditions.

Correctness: **True**
