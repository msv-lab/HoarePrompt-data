Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` equals `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` equals the maximum value between `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.
