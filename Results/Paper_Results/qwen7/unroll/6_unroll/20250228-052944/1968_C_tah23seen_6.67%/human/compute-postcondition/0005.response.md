Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the maximum value between `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`; `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**

Explanation: The last line of the code updates the last element of the `ans` list by adding the last element of the `arr` list to the second last element of the `ans` list. This ensures that the final value of `ans[-1]` is correctly calculated based on the previous values in the `ans` list and `arr` list. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged according to their previous definitions.
