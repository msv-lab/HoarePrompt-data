Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).
2. The provided solution attempts to construct the array \(a\) using a specific algorithm.
3. Let's analyze the algorithm step-by-step:
   - Initialize `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element in `ans`, it tries to set `ans[i]` to the maximum of `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`.
   - This ensures that \(a_i \geq a_{i-1} + x_i\), which is a necessary condition for \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
   - Finally, it sets `ans[-1]` to ensure the last element satisfies the modulo condition with the second last element.
4. The logic seems sound and should work for constructing an array \(a\) that meets the problem requirements.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should produce a valid solution for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
