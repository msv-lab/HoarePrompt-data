Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of page numbers in descending order and then printing the sum of the two largest page numbers. This approach is correct because:

1. The problem requires dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number in each pile.
2. By sorting the list in descending order, the two largest page numbers will be at the beginning of the list.
3. Summing these two largest values gives the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.

Given that the program correctly sorts the list and sums the two largest elements, it should produce the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
