You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())

    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        l = input()
        
        lst = l.split(' ')
        
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive; `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the input lists for each iteration of the outer loop.
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the input lists for each iteration of the outer loop; `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `ans_f` contains the printed values from each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of integers and stores these sums in a list `ans_f`. Finally, it prints each sum in `ans_f`. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `ans_f` and prints its contents.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and processing of the numbers. Specifically, the program assumes that the input string `l` will always contain exactly 2n elements separated by spaces, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The program also incorrectly removes elements from the list in a way that does not ensure the optimal score is achieved.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The program will fail to produce the correct output for the third test case. The correct output should be 3, but the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not sort the numbers before pairing them optimally.

A corrected version of the program would involve sorting the list of numbers and then pairing the smallest numbers together to maximize the score. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to ensure optimal pairing
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))  # Pair the smallest numbers
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected version ensures that the numbers are paired optimally, thus achieving the maximum possible score.
