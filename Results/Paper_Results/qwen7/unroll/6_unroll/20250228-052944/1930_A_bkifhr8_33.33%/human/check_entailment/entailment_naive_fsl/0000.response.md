Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and processing of the numbers. Specifically, the program assumes that the input string `l` will always contain exactly 2n elements separated by spaces, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The program also incorrectly removes elements from the list in a way that does not ensure the optimal score is achieved.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The program will fail to produce the correct output for the third test case. The correct output should be 3, but the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not sort the numbers before pairing them optimally.

A corrected version of the program would involve sorting the list of numbers and then pairing the smallest numbers together to maximize the score. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to ensure optimal pairing
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))  # Pair the smallest numbers
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

This corrected version ensures that the numbers are paired optimally, thus achieving the maximum possible score.
