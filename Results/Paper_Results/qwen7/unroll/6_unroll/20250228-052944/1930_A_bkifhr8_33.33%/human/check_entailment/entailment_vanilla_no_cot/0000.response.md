Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of List Length**: The program attempts to remove elements from `lst` using indices that do not match the logic of the problem. Specifically, the indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are incorrect and will lead to out-of-range errors when `len(lst)` is less than 2.

2. **Incomplete Removal Logic**: The program breaks out of the loop prematurely after processing the first two elements, which does not ensure that all pairs are processed correctly.

3. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The program unnecessarily checks if `len(lst) != 2` before attempting to remove elements, which is redundant since the loop should handle the removal of elements in pairs.

4. **Improper Loop Control**: The outer loop runs `n * 2` times, but this is unnecessary. The inner loop should run `n` times, as specified in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to always pick the smallest elements
        ans = 0
        for _ in range(n):
            ans += lst[_]  # Add the smaller of the two pairs
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the first element (smallest)
            lst.pop(0)  # Remove the second element (next smallest)
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the list is sorted, and the smallest elements are always picked to maximize the score. The loop runs `n` times, ensuring that exactly `n` moves are made, and the elements are removed in pairs as required.
