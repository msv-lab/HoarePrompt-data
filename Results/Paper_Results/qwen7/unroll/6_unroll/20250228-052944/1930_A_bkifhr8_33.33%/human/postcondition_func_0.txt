The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of integers and stores these sums in a list `ans_f`. Finally, it prints each sum in `ans_f`. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `ans_f` and prints its contents.
