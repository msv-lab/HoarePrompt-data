Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether `func_2` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the problem and compare it with the implementation of `func_2`.

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, we need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
2. If no such distribution is possible, the output should be `-1`.
3. If multiple solutions exist, any one of them can be printed.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**: 
   - `N` is read as the number of outcomes.
   - A list of multipliers `vals` is read for each outcome.

2. **Calculating `den`**:
   - `den` is initialized to the first multiplier in the list.
   - `func_1` is used to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `den` and each subsequent multiplier in the list. This is done using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)` which is equivalent to LCM(a, b).

3. **Calculating `vprod`**:
   - `vprod` is calculated as a list where each element is `den` divided by each corresponding element in the original list `vals`.

4. **Adjusting `den`**:
   - `den` is updated by subtracting the sum of `vprod`.
   - If `den` becomes less than or equal to zero, `-1` is printed, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, the elements of `vprod` are printed.

### Correctness Check:
- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation ensures that the total amount bet is a common multiple of all multipliers. This step is crucial because it allows us to uniformly distribute the bets across all outcomes.
- **Adjustment of `den`**: Subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `den` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. This is because `den` represents the smallest amount that can be evenly distributed among all outcomes while still satisfying the condition.

Given the problem requirements and the implementation of `func_2`, the function correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. It handles the necessary calculations and checks to ensure that the conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions.

Correctness: **True**
