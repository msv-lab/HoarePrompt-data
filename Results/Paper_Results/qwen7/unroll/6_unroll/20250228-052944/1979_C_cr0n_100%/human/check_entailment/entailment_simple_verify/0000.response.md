### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem requirements step-by-step.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
- For each test case, we need to output either `-1` if no such distribution exists or a valid distribution of bets.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - The purpose of this function is to find a common denominator for the multipliers.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier `k_1`.
   - It then iteratively updates `den` using `func_1(den, k_i)` for each subsequent multiplier.
   - After computing `den`, it calculates `vprod` as `den // k_i` for each `k_i`.
   - Finally, it checks if `den` is greater than the sum of `vprod`. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

#### Key Points:
- The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers to compute `den`.
- `vprod` is computed as `den // k_i` for each `k_i`.
- The program checks if `den` is greater than the sum of `vprod`. If not, it prints `-1`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the test case mentioned in the original assessment:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  5
  5 5 5 5 5
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  -1
  ```

- **Program Execution**:
  - `N = 5`
  - `vals = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - `den = 5`
  - Iteratively updating `den`:
    - `den = func_1(5, 5) = 5`
    - `den = func_1(5, 5) = 5`
    - `den = func_1(5, 5) = 5`
    - `den = func_1(5, 5) = 5`
    - `den = func_1(5, 5) = 5`
  - `vprod = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 5`
  - `den - sum(vprod) = 5 - 5 = 0`
  - Since `den` is not greater than `sum(vprod)`, the program prints `-1`.

This example correctly identifies that no valid distribution exists for this input. However, let's consider another test case to ensure the program works in general.

- **Input**: 
  ```
  3
  3 2 7
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  27 41 12
  ```

- **Program Execution**:
  - `N = 3`
  - `vals = [3, 2, 7]`
  - `den = 3`
  - Iteratively updating `den`:
    - `den = func_1(3, 2) = 6`
    - `den = func_1(6, 7) = 42`
  - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - `den - sum(vprod) = 42 - 41 = 1`
  - Since `den` is greater than `sum(vprod)`, the program prints `14 21 6`.

This example also correctly identifies a valid distribution.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or identify when no such distribution exists. The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the program does not meet the problem's requirement in all cases, but the specific example provided in the assessment is indeed handled correctly by the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
