Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for splitting the array into two subsequences \( s \) and \( t \) to minimize the total penalty. Specifically, the logic for deciding which subsequence an element belongs to is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
5
2 1 2 1 2
```

The expected output should be 1 because we can split the array into \( s = [2, 2, 2] \) and \( t = [1, 1] \). In this case, the penalty \( p(s) = 0 \) and \( p(t) = 0 \), so the total penalty is 0.

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the penalty. For instance, if we follow the current logic, the program might split the array into \( s = [2, 1, 2] \) and \( t = [1, 2] \). This results in a penalty of \( p(s) = 1 \) (since \( 1 < 2 \)) and \( p(t) = 1 \) (since \( 1 < 2 \)), leading to a total penalty of 2.

This shows that the program does not always find the optimal split, hence it is incorrect.
