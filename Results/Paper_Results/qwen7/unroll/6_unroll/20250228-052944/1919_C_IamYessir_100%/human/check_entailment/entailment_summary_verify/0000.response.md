### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required logic for minimizing the penalty.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Splitting the Array**: The array `a` needs to be split into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that every element is in exactly one of these subsequences.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated as the number of increasing pairs within each subsequence.
3. **Optimal Split**: The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

#### Provided Program Logic:
- The program iterates through the array `lit` and decides whether to place each element in `a` or `b` based on the last elements of `a` and `b`.
- If the last element of `a` is greater than the last element of `b`, it places the element in `b` if it is greater than or equal to the last element of `b`, otherwise in `a`.
- If the last elements of `a` and `b` are equal, it places the element in `a`.
- If the last element of `a` is less than the last element of `b`, it places the element in `a` if it is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise in `b`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Assumption**: The provided logic seems to be trying to ensure that the last element of `a` is always greater than or equal to the last element of `b`. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't guarantee an optimal split.
2. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `5 2 1 2 1 2`.
   - The expected optimal split is `s = [2, 2, 2]` and `t = [1, 1]`, resulting in a total penalty of 0.
   - However, the provided program might split the array into `s = [2, 1, 2]` and `t = [1, 2]`, resulting in a total penalty of 2.
3. **Correct Approach**: To minimize the penalty, we need to sort the array and then split it into two parts such that the penalty is minimized. The optimal strategy is to place the smallest elements in one subsequence and the largest elements in the other.

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two halves. This ensures that the penalty is minimized because the smallest elements will form an increasing subsequence with no penalties, and the largest elements will also form an increasing subsequence with no penalties.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for splitting the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
