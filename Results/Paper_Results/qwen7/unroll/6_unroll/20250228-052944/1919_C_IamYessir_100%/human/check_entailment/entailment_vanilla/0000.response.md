Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `lit`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program initializes two lists `a` and `b` to store the elements of the split subsequences.
   - It also initializes a counter `cp` which seems unused in the current implementation.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `lit`.
   - For each element, it checks the last elements of `a` and `b` (if they exist).
   - It then decides whether to append the current element to `a` or `b` based on the comparison of the last elements of `a` and `b` with the current element.
   - There are some conditions that seem to be incorrectly implemented, leading to potential issues in splitting the array optimally.

4. **Calculating Penalty:**
   - After splitting the array, the program calculates the penalty for both `a` and `b` by counting the number of indices where the current element is greater than the previous element.
   - The penalties are summed up and printed.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The logic for deciding which list (`a` or `b`) to append the current element to is flawed. The conditions used to decide the placement of elements do not ensure the optimal split that minimizes the penalty.
  - For example, the condition `if x > y:` followed by `if y >= lit[i]:` and `elif lit[i] > x:` does not guarantee an optimal split. This logic can lead to incorrect splits where the penalty could be higher than necessary.

- **Unnecessary Counter `cp`:**
  - The variable `cp` is initialized but never used in the code, which is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed logic in the splitting process, the program does not correctly implement the optimal split to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
