Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \)). It calculates and accumulates a result based on these inputs using a specific algorithm involving a while loop. Finally, it prints the computed result for each test case as an integer.**
