Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`. This part is correct.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The variable `count` starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the while loop.
   - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `n / count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks, which seems to be a condition to stop the loop early.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
   - The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`.

3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The given program does not explicitly calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` or check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The current implementation does not check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - Instead, it seems to be incrementally adding values to `ans` without properly checking the required condition.
   - The logic inside the loop does not align with the problem requirements.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
