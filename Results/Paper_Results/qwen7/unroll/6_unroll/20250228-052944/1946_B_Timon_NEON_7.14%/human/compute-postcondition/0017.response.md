Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers where each element is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns a list containing a single element, which is -1.**

This means the function `func_2` takes a list of integers as input and always returns a list with a single element, which is `-1`.
