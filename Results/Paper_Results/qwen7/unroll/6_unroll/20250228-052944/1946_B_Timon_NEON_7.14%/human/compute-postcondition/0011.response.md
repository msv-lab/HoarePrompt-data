Output State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]], `total_max_segment` is [0, 0, len(arr) - 1].

Explanation: The loop iterates over each `segment` in `segments_variants`. The condition checks if the first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of the current `segment`. If true, it updates `total_max_segment` to the current `segment`. Since the initial value of `total_max_segment` is [-1], any `segment` in `segments_variants` will satisfy the condition and update `total_max_segment` to the first segment in `segments_variants`, which is [0, 0, len(arr) - 1]. The other variables (`max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
