Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]].**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment to `segments_variants`. This new segment is formed by concatenating `new_segment` (which is an empty list) with the length of `arr` minus one. Since `new_segment` is an empty list, the new segment added to `segments_variants` is `[len(arr) - 1]`. Given that `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`max_sum` and `segments_variants`) are updated accordingly.
