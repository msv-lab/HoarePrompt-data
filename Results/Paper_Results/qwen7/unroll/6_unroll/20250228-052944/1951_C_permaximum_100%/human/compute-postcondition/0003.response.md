Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `tickets_bought` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `tickets_bought` to 0. This does not affect the values of `total_cost`, `pq`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
