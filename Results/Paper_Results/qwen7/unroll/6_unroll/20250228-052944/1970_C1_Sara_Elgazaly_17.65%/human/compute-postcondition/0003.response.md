Output State: **x is an integer input from the user, y is an integer input from the user, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; lst is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing edges (nodes connected to the keys). The defaultdict lst is populated with x-1 edges based on user input.**
