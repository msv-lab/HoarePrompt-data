Output State: **`s` is True, x is an integer input from the user, y is an integer input from the user, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; lst is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing edges (nodes connected to the keys).**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `s`. No other changes are made to the values of the other variables or the structure of the defaultdict `lst`. Therefore, the output state retains all the preconditions and only updates the value of `s` to `True`.
