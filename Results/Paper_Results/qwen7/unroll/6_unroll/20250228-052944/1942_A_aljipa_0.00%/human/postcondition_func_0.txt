The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \). Based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \), it prints one of three possible outputs for each test case: a list of \( n \) ones, a range from 0 to \( n-1 \), or -1. The number of test cases is determined by the first input \( t \), which represents the total count of test cases. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
