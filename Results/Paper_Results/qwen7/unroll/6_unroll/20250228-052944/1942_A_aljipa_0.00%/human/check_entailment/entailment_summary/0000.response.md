Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by:
   - Generating an array of `n` ones if `k == n`.
   - Generating a range from `0` to `n-1` if `k == 1`.
   - Printing `-1` for all other cases.
3. Let's analyze the correctness of these approaches:
   - If `k == n`, the array `[1] * n` will have all cyclic shifts sorted because all elements are the same.
   - If `k == 1`, the array `range(n)` (e.g., `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`) has only one cyclic shift that is sorted (the original array itself).
   - For any other case, the code simply prints `-1`.

4. However, the problem statement does not guarantee that the generated arrays will always meet the requirement of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. Specifically:
   - An array of all ones (`[1] * n`) will have all cyclic shifts sorted, so it only works when `k == n`.
   - An array with distinct elements (like `range(n)`) will generally have fewer than `k` sorted cyclic shifts unless `k == 1`.

5. The provided solution does not account for the general case where `1 < k < n`. It only handles specific edge cases and does not provide a general solution to generate an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
