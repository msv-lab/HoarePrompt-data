Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution only checks if for every character position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. The logic needs to ensure that for each position `i`, if the character in `t` is lowercase, then the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match the character in `t`, and if the character in `t` is uppercase, then the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of the character in `t`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct a template based on the characters of `a` and `b` and check if `c` violates any of these constraints. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    # Create a template based on a and b
    template = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
            template += 'C'  # Capital letter means it should not match c[i]
        else:
            template += 'c'  # Lowercase letter means it should match c[i]
    
    # Check if the template allows a and b to match but not c
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i] == 'c' and (a[i] != c[i] or b[i] != c[i]):
            return 'NO'
        elif template[i] == 'C' and (a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]):
            return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_2()
```

This solution constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b` and then checks if `c` violates any of the constraints defined by the template. If `c` violates the template, it returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
