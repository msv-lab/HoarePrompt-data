The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of iterations), an integer `n` (length of strings), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to perform some unspecified operations and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.
