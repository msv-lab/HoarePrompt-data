Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to `arr`, which is a list of integers derived from the input.
