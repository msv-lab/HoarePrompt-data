### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (`flag` variable).
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` because no elements need to be removed to make it non-uniform.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove using the logic:
     - It iterates through the array and counts consecutive occurrences of the same value.
     - It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements to remove to break the uniformity.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
   - It also correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of elements to break the uniformity.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is uniform is correct.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is also correct.
   - The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct according to the problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
