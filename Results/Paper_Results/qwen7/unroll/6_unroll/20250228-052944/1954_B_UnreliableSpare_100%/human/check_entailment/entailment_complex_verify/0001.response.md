### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (`flag` variable).
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` because no elements need to be removed to make it non-uniform.
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove using the logic:
     - It iterates through the array and counts consecutive occurrences of the same value.
     - It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive elements to remove to break the uniformity.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the minimum count of consecutive elements starting from `arr[0]` and does not account for other potential sequences of consecutive elements that could be shorter but still break the uniformity.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is uniform is correct.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. The program only considers the first element `arr[0]` and does not consider other potential sequences of consecutive elements that could be shorter but still break the uniformity.
   - For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`. The program would incorrectly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove as 3, but the correct answer is 2 (removing the first two 3s).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the uniformity of the array. It only considers the first element and does not account for other potential sequences of consecutive elements that could be shorter but still break the uniformity.

### Final:
**False**
