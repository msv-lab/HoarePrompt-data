Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the provided output cases, it appears there might be a misunderstanding since the function definition does not include any parameters. Based on the description, the function seems to be designed to handle multiple test cases (indicated by `t`), but the function itself as defined does not accept any parameters. Therefore, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything, as it would need to be called within a loop or context where `t` and `n` are defined and passed to it.
