Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, and all other variables (t, n, m, k, a, b) retain their initial conditions.**

Explanation: The code `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. This means `nabors` now holds the value of the input integer. However, since the initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by this line of code, they remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5 and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5 also remains valid.
