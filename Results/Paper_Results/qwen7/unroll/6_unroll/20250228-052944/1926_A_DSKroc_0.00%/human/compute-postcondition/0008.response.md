Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, ac and bc are lists of integers where each pair (ac[i], bc[i]) represents the counts of 'A' and 'B' respectively in the i-th string input. If the length of ac is greater than the length of bc, the length of ac remains greater than the length of bc. If the length of ac is equal to the length of bc, the length of ac remains equal to the length of bc.**
