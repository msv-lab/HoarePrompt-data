You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` input strings, each of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B' in any string, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - Two counters `ac` and `bc` are initialized to zero.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is 'A', `ac` is incremented.
   - If the character is 'B', `bc` is incremented.

3. **Determining the Most Frequent Character:**
   - After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program checks which counter is greater.
   - If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Edge Cases and Assumptions:**
   - The problem specifies that the string length is always 5.
   - The program does not handle ties (i.e., when `ac` equals `bc`), but since the problem guarantees that all strings are distinct and of length 5, there will always be a clear majority.

### Verification:
- The logic for counting the characters is correct.
- The comparison and printing logic is also correct.
- The program handles the specified constraints and examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors or assumptions beyond the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
