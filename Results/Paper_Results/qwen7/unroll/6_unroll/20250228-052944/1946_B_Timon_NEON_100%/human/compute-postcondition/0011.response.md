Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over `segments_variants`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `segment` and `segments_variants`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that had the highest sum at some point during the loop's execution.
   - `segment` is an element from `segments_variants`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment. If `segments_variants` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on `segments_variants` having at least one segment, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` is not empty.
   - The value of `segment` will vary depending on the elements in `segments_variants`, but the loop can proceed as long as there is at least one segment in the list.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `segments_variants` must not be an empty list.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`segments_variants` is a non-empty list, max_sum is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in arr, arr is the list of integers provided, new_segment is an empty list, max_segment is the last segment considered before finding a new one with a potentially higher sum, total_max_segment is initialized to [-1]**
