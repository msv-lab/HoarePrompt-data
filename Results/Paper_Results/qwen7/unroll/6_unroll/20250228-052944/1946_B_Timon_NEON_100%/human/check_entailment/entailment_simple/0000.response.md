Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array through a series of operations where we can insert the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The key insight is that inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the array's sum.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible sum can be achieved by repeatedly inserting the sum of the entire array, since the sum of the entire array is the most beneficial subarray sum to insert.
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the array, but it seems unnecessary for solving the problem directly. Instead, the sum of the entire array is more relevant.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a`.
   - The function `func_2` is called to get the maximum segment sum, but this function is not necessary for the solution.
   - The program calculates the answer using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{answer} = (\text{max\_segment}[0] \times 2^k + \text{sum}(a) - \text{max\_segment}[0]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
     However, since `max_segment[0]` is either the maximum sum of a subarray or zero, the term \(\text{max\_segment}[0] \times 2^k\) is redundant because the maximum sum of the entire array is what matters.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The function `func_3` is not used in the provided code.

4. **Simplification**:
   - Given the above observations, the program can be simplified to:
     ```python
     from math import pow

     t = int(input())
     mod = 1000000007
     for _ in range(t):
         (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
         a = list(map(int, input().split()))
         total_sum = sum(a)
         answer = (total_sum * pow(2, k, mod) + total_sum - total_sum) % mod
         print(answer)
     ```

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program is almost correct but unnecessarily uses `func_2` which is not required. The core logic is sound and the modulo operation is handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
