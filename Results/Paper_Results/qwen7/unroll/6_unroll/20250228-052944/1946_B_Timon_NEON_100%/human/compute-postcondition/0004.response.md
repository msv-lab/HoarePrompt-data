Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(arr)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized before the loop, so it should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `len(arr)` is a function that returns the length of the list `arr`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.
   - Since `arr` is a list of integers, `len(arr)` will be a non-negative integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - We need to ensure that `len(arr)` is a positive integer (since if `arr` is empty, the loop won't execute).

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `arr` should be a non-empty list (i.e., `len(arr)` must be greater than 0).

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
