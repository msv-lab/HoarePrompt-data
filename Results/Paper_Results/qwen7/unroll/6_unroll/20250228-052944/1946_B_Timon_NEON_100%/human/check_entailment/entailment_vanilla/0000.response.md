Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly calculates the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the result fits within the required modulo constraint.
   
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray, but its implementation seems incomplete and incorrect. Here's why:
   - The function initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` but does not properly update them.
   - The logic for handling negative and positive elements is flawed. It doesn't correctly accumulate sums and track the maximum segment.
   - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` without ensuring they are updated correctly.
   - The final loop to determine the `total_max_segment` is also problematic, as it doesn't handle the case where the maximum segment might be the entire array or a single element.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is not implemented at all, which means it cannot contribute to solving the problem.

Given these observations, the functions provided do not correctly solve the problem. The logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is incorrect, and the third function is completely missing.

Correctness: **False**
