Output State: `v` is a list of length n+1 where the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are integers from the input split and converted to int. The value printed is either 2 or nothing, depending on whether the condition `v[v[i]] == i` is met for any `i` in the range 1 to n. If the condition is met for any `i`, then 2 is printed; otherwise, nothing is printed.
