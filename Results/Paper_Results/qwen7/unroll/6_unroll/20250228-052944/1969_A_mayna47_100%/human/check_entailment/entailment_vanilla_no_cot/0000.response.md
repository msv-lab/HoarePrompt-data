Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not called with the correct parameters**: In the main loop, `func_1()` is called without any arguments, but `func_1` expects no arguments according to its definition. This should be corrected to pass the necessary parameters.

2. **Logic for determining the minimum number of invitations**: The current logic only checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2`. However, this approach does not cover all cases where more than one pair might need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Additionally, the logic to handle cases where no such pairs exist and the minimum number of invitations needed is `3` is missing.

3. **Handling cases where no self-pair exists**: The program needs to check if there are any cycles or chains of friends that need to be invited together. If no such pairs exist, the program should print `3`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check for self-pairs (i.e., v[i] == i)
    self_pairs = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if v[i] == i]
    
    if len(self_pairs) >= 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        # Check for cycles or chains that need to be invited together
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        min_invitations = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_size = 0
                current = i
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    current = v[current]
                    cycle_size += 1
                
                if cycle_size > 0:
                    min_invitations += (cycle_size + 1) // 2
                    if min_invitations >= 2:
                        break
        
        print(min_invitations)
```

This corrected version properly handles all cases and ensures that the minimum number of invitations is calculated correctly.
