Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and a list of integers representing the best friends' indices.
- The program constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
- The program then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such an index is found, it means that there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and inviting both of them would ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, it prints `2` and returns.
- If no such index is found, it prints `3`, which is the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. This is because we need to invite the friend and their best friend, and if no such pair exists, we need to invite three friends to ensure at least 2 come.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program correctly determines the minimum number of invitations required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
