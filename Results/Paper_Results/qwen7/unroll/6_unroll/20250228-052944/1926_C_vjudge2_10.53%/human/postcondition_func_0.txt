The function reads an integer `t` and `t` integers `n` from the input, then processes these integers to update two lists, `values` and `sum_values`. After processing, it prints the value of `sum_values` at the index of each integer in the `numbers` list. The function does not return any value but modifies the `values` and `sum_values` lists based on the input integers.
