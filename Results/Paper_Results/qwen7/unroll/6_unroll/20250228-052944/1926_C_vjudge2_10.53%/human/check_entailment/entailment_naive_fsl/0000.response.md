Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to replace each integer with the sum of its digits and then compute the sum of these new numbers. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Summing Digits**: The program attempts to split the number into digits but uses an incorrect approach. For instance, it tries to extract the last digit and the remaining part of the number incorrectly, leading to wrong sums.

2. **Unnecessary Variables**: The variables `values` and `sum_values` are not used correctly. They are initialized but not utilized in the way intended.

3. **Incorrect Loop Boundaries**: The loop that processes numbers from 10 to `n` is problematic. It does not handle the sum of digits correctly for numbers greater than 9.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def solve(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += sum_of_digits(i)
    return total_sum

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results.append(str(solve(n)))
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_1()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` and then sums these values. It handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
