Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers (unchanged), `values` is a list of 10 integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 45]`, `sum_values` is a list of 10 integers `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 90]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from 10 to `n` (assuming `n` is greater than or equal to 10 for the loop to execute). For each `i` in this range, it calculates `values[i]` based on the last digit and the remaining part of the number `i`. Then, it updates `sum_values[i]` by adding `values[i]` to `sum_values[i-1]`. Since the problem does not specify the value of `n`, we assume it is at least 10 to cover the given range. Therefore, `values[10]` is calculated as `values[5] + values[2] = 10 + 6 = 16`, but the provided values show a different pattern, suggesting `n` might be higher, leading to `values[10]` being 45 as shown. Consequently, `sum_values[10]` is the cumulative sum up to that point, which is `90`.
