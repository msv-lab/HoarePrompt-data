#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i in range n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break
                else:

    #State: The output state will depend on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program checks if it's possible to select elements from the list `o` such that the element at index `f-1` appears before or at position `k-1` in the sorted list, considering the frequency of other elements. If such a selection is possible, it prints 'YES', 'MAYBE', or 'NO' based on the remaining positions after accounting for the frequencies of other elements. The final output state will be a series of 'YES', 'MAYBE', or 'NO' based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to select elements from the list `o` (derived from `a`) such that the element at index `f-1` appears before or at position `k-1` in the sorted list, considering the frequency of other elements. Based on this check, it prints 'YES', 'MAYBE', or 'NO' for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
