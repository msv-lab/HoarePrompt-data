You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and after executing the loop, `ans` is the sum of counts calculated based on the conditions provided within the loop for each input list `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string `s`. For each string, it calculates a value `ans` based on the count of zeros and ones in the string. Specifically, for each zero in the string, it adds 1 to `ans` if there has been at least one one before it; otherwise, it adds the total number of zeros minus the count of ones seen so far. The function prints the calculated value `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to transform a binary string into a sorted non-decreasing order using cyclic shifts on substrings, and we need to find the minimum cost required to do this. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring that was shifted.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and calculates the answer (`ans`) based on certain conditions:
     - If the current character is 0, it checks if there have been any 1s before the current position. If yes, it increments `ans`.
     - If the current character is 1, it calculates the cost as the number of zeroes minus the count of 0s seen so far.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for counting the number of zeroes and handling the transitions between 0s and 1s seems flawed. Specifically, the approach does not correctly simulate the process of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - The logic for calculating the cost does not accurately reflect the minimum cost to perform the required cyclic shifts.
   - The given solution does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the shifts and does not ensure the minimum cost is achieved.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example provided in the problem statement, the given solution produces incorrect results for most test cases. For instance, for the string "101011", the expected output is 9, but the provided solution outputs 5, which is incorrect.

Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is False.

Correctness: **False**
