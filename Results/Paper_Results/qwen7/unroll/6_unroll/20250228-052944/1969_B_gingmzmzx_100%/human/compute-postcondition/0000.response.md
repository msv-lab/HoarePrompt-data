Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
