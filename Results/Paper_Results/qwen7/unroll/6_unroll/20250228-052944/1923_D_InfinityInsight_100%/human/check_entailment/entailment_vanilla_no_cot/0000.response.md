Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Neighbors**: The function `func_2` attempts to find the nearest smaller element to the left using binary search (`func_1`). However, this approach does not accurately capture the scenario where a slime can only eat its immediate neighbor if it is strictly larger.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Steps**: The logic for calculating the minimum steps for a slime to be eaten is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the left cumulative sum (`left`) can be used to determine the position of the nearest smaller element, which is not always the case.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when a slime cannot eat any of its neighbors due to the constraints of the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the process of slimes eating their neighbors while keeping track of the minimum steps each slime takes to be eaten. This involves maintaining a dynamic list of slimes and updating it as slimes are eaten.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def solve(n, a):
    stack = []
    result = [-1] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        count = 0
        while stack and a[stack[-1]] < a[i]:
            result[stack.pop()] = count + 1
            count += 1
        stack.append(i)
    
    return result

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(*solve(n, a))
```

This solution works as follows:
- We use a stack to keep track of the indices of the slimes.
- For each slime, we check if it can eat its neighbors by comparing its size with the sizes of the slimes at the top of the stack.
- If it can eat a neighbor, we update the result for that neighbor and increment the count of steps.
- Finally, we append the current index to the stack.

This approach ensures that we correctly simulate the process and calculate the minimum steps for each slime to be eaten.
