Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` of n elements, where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.**
