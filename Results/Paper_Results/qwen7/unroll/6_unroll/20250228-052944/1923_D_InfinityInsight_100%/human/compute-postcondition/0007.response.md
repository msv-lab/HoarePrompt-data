Output State: `a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `left` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that index (i.e., `left[i] = sum(a[:i])` for 0 ≤ i ≤ n), `last` is a list of n elements where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the slime size before the current index (if the slime size changes, the index is updated), `ans` is a list of n elements all initialized to -1.
