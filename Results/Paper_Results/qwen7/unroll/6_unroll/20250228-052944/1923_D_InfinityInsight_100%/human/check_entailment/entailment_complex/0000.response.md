Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the functionality of each function and verify their correctness.

### Function 1 (`func_1`)
- **Purpose**: Find the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the list `a`.
- **Behavior**:
  - If `x` is not found in `a`, it returns `-1`.
  - If `x` is found, it returns the index of `x` incremented by one.
- **Correctness**:
  - The function uses binary search via `bisect_left` to find the index of `x` in `a`.
  - If `x` is found, the returned index is incremented by one, which is correct because the index is zero-based.
  - If `x` is not found, the function correctly returns `-1`.

### Function 2 (`func_2`)
- **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
- **Behavior**:
  - It maintains two lists: `left` for cumulative sums and `last` for the last occurrence of each slime size.
  - For each slime, it checks if the current slime size is less than the previous one. If so, it sets the answer for that slime to `1`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.
- **Correctness**:
  - The cumulative sum list `left` is correctly constructed.
  - The `last` list correctly tracks the last occurrence of each slime size.
  - The logic for calculating the trace-back positions is correct. It uses binary search (`func_1`) to find the appropriate position in the cumulative sum list `left`.

### Main Program
- **Behavior**:
  - It calls `func_2` twice: once with the original list and once with the reversed list.
  - It then compares the results and takes the maximum value for each position.
- **Correctness**:
  - This ensures that the result considers both directions of the slimes, providing a more accurate answer.

### Overall Correctness
- Both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly according to the problem statement.
- The main program logic is sound and ensures that the final result is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
