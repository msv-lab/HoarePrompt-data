You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `left` is [0], `last` is a list of n elements where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the slime size before the current index (if the slime size changes, the index is updated), `ans` is a list of n elements all initialized to -1.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `left` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that index, `last` is a list of n elements where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the slime size before the current index (if the slime size changes, the index is updated), `ans` is a list of n elements all initialized to -1.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `left` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that index, `last` is a list of n elements where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the slime size before the current index (if the slime size changes, the index is updated), `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' of n elements where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` of n elements, where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'ans' of n elements where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
