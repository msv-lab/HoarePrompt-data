Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`. Thus, the condition for the loop to execute is that `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. This means setting `i` to its initial value, which is 1, and ensuring that `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `i` should be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
