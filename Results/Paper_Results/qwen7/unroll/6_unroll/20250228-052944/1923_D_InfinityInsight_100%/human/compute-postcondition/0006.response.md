Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Understand the List `a`**: The list `a` contains `n` non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the list `a`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. This means setting `i` to the first element of the list `a`.

Given these points, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes.
- `i` should be set to the first element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `i` is the first element of the list `a`**.
