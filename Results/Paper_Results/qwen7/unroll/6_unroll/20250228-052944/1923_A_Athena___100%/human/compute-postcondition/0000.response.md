Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and now `t` is set to the integer input received.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an integer input within the range 1 to 1000 and assigns it to the variable `t`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged, meaning `t` is still within the specified range, but its specific value is now determined by the user input.
