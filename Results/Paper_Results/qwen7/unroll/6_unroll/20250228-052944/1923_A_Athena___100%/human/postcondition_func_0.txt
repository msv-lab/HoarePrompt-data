The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of `n` integers indicating whether cells contain chips (1) or are free (0). It removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the remaining zeros. Finally, it prints the count of zeros for each test case.
