Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells.
3. It removes leading zeros from the list `a` by using the first `while` loop.
4. It removes trailing zeros from the list `a` by using the second `while` loop.
5. It then counts the number of zeros in the modified list `a`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.
6. This approach works because:
   - Leading zeros are removed, ensuring the first chip is not in a free cell.
   - Trailing zeros are removed, ensuring the last chip is not followed by a free cell.
   - Counting the remaining zeros gives the number of operations needed to move all chips to be adjacent.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the function, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
