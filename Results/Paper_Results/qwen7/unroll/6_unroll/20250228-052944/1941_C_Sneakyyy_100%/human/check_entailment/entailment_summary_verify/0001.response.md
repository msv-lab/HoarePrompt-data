### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length and Content**: For each test case, the program correctly reads the length `n` of the string `a` and the string itself.
3. **Substring Check**: The program checks substrings of length 3 starting from index `i` to see if they match either "map" or "pie". If a match is found, it increments the counter `ans` and skips the next two characters (`i += 3`).
4. **Increment Logic**: If no match is found, the program simply increments the index `i` by 1 (`i += 1`).
5. **Output**: After processing the entire string, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program's logic. The program only checks for non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". This means that if a string contains overlapping occurrences of these substrings, the program will not correctly count the minimum number of deletions needed.

For example, consider the string "mapmap". The program would only count one occurrence of "map" and skip the next two characters, resulting in an incorrect answer of 1 instead of the correct answer of 2.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie". One way to do this is to use a different approach, such as dynamic programming or a more careful substring search that accounts for overlaps.

### Analysis:
- The current logic fails to handle overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".
- The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful in cases where there are overlapping substrings.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect based on the problem description because it does not handle overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
