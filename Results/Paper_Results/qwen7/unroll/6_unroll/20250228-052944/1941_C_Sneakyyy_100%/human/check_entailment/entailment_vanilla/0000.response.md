### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length and Content**: For each test case, the program correctly reads the length `n` of the string `a` and the string itself.
3. **Substring Check**: The program checks substrings of length 3 starting from index `i` to see if they match either "map" or "pie". If a match is found, it increments the counter `ans` and skips the next two characters (`i += 3`).
4. **Increment Logic**: If no match is found, the program simply increments the index `i` by 1 (`i += 1`).
5. **Output**: After processing the entire string, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The logic to find and count the occurrences of "map" or "pie" in the string is correct.
- The program correctly handles the removal of characters by skipping them when a match is found.
- The overall approach ensures that the minimum number of deletions is made to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
