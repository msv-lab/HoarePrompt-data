Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "pie" or "map". For example, in the input "ppiee", the program would only detect one occurrence of "pie" and delete two characters, but it should detect both occurrences and delete four characters to make the string beautiful. The current implementation increments the index `i` by 3 whenever it finds "pie" or "map", which skips over potential subsequent matches. This leads to incorrect results in cases with overlapping substrings.
