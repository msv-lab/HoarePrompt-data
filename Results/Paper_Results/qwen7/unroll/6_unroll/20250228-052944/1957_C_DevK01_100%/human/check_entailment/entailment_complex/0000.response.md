### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of unique final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move consists of placing a rook and its mirrored counterpart by the computer. The key is to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without violating the no-attack rule.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then iterates through the \( k \) moves, adjusting \( n \) based on whether the move was mirrored or not.
   - Finally, it calls the function `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible configurations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with the first two elements set to 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( n \), updating `dp` using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`.
   - After processing, it returns the last element of `dp`.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The formula used in the function is derived from combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming principles. Specifically, it calculates the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \( n \) such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` accounts for the placement of rooks in the current row and column while ensuring no attacks.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the function ensures that the result is computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` accurately computes the number of possible final configurations based on the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
