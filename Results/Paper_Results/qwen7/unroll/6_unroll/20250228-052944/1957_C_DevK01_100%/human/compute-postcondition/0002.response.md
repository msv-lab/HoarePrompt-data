Output State: `dp` is a list containing the values generated by the loop for each iteration from 2 to n, where each element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`, and the first element of the list is removed after each calculation.

Since the exact values depend on the value of `n`, the output state will contain a list of numbers starting from the second element of the initial state `[1, 1]` up to the nth element, each calculated based on the given formula and modulo operation.
