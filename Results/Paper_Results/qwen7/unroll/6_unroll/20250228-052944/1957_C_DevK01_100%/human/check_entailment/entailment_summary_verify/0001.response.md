### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed breakdown of the program and its components. Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` to ensure the correctness of the analysis.

1. **Reading Input and Processing Moves:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then processes each of the `k` moves, updating the effective size of the board `n`:
     - If the move `(a, b)` has `a != b`, it effectively reduces the board size by 2 (since both positions are now occupied).
     - If the move `(a, b)` has `a == b`, it reduces the board size by 1 (since only one unique position is occupied).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the number of possible final configurations of the board.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with base cases `[1, 1]`.
   - For each subsequent value up to `n`, it updates the DP array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (7 + 10^9)
     \]
   - Finally, it returns `dp[n]`.

### Verification of Functionality:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - The base cases `[1, 1]` are correct for `n=0` and `n=1` because:
     - For `n=0`, there are no positions, so there is exactly 1 configuration (no rooks).
     - For `n=1`, there is exactly 1 position, and it can either have a rook or not, giving 2 configurations.

2. **DP Array Update:**
   - The update rule for `dp[i]` seems to be derived from combinatorial logic related to placing rooks on an `i x i` board without them attacking each other.
   - The term `2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]` accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, considering the previous configurations.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints (modulo \(10^9 + 7\)).

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example test case:
- `n = 4`, `k = 1`, and the move is `(1, 2)`.
- After processing the move, `n` is reduced by 2 (since `1 != 2`), resulting in `n = 2`.
- The function `func_1(2)` should compute the number of configurations for a `2x2` board, which is indeed 3 (as shown in the problem statement).

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - For `n=0`, `dp[0] = 1` (no configurations).
   - For `n=1`, `dp[1] = 2` (either place a rook or not).

2. **DP Array Update:**
   - For `n=2`:
     \[
     dp[2] = (dp[1] + 2 \times 1 \times dp[0]) \mod (10^9 + 7) = (2 + 2 \times 1 \times 1) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 4
     \]
   - For `n=3`:
     \[
     dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 \times 2 \times dp[1]) \mod (10^9 + 7) = (4 + 2 \times 2 \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 12
     \]
   - For `n=4`:
     \[
     dp[4] = (dp[3] + 2 \times 3 \times dp[2]) \mod (10^9 + 7) = (12 + 2 \times 3 \times 4) \mod (10^9 + 7) = 36
     \]

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes the moves and uses the dynamic programming approach to compute the number of possible final configurations. The logic and implementation appear to be sound.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
