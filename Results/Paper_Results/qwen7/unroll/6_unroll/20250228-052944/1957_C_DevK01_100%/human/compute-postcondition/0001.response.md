Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at 2 and increments until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 2, the initial value of `i` should be set to 2.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**: The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute. Given that the loop starts with `i = 2`, `n` must be at least 2 (since if `n` were less than 2, the loop would not start).

5. **Consider the state of other variables**: The variable `dp` is a list containing [1, 1], but this list is not directly involved in the loop head. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `dp`.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
