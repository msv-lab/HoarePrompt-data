Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. The logic in the `func_1` function is not relevant to the problem and does not address the actual combinatorial problem at hand.

To solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

1. **Initial State**: After \(k\) moves, some rows and columns are occupied by rooks.
2. **Remaining Rows and Columns**: Calculate the number of unoccupied rows and columns.
3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: Use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without attacking each other.

Here's a corrected approach:

```python
t = int(input())
mod = 10**9 + 7

def count_configurations(n, k):
    # Initialize the number of available rows and columns
    available_rows = n
    available_cols = n
    
    # Subtract the occupied rows and columns
    for _ in range(k):
        r, c = map(int, input().split())
        if r != c:
            available_rows -= 1
            available_cols -= 1
        else:
            available_rows -= 1
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to choose available rows and columns
    # for placing the remaining rooks
    if available_rows == 0 or available_cols == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return pow(available_rows, available_cols, mod)

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_configurations(n, k))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize the number of available rows and columns as `n`.
2. **Subtract Occupied Rows and Columns**: For each move, we decrement the available rows and columns accordingly.
3. **Combination Calculation**: If there are still available rows and columns, we use combinatorial methods to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks. If no rows or columns are available, there is only one configuration (no more rooks can be placed).

This approach ensures that the solution is correct and addresses the combinatorial nature of the problem.
