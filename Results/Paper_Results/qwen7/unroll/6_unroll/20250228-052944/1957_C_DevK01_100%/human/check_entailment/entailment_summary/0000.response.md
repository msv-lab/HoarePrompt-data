Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, where each move involves placing a rook and mirroring the move by the opponent.
2. The given program correctly calculates the number of remaining positions on the board after the initial k moves.
3. The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board without them attacking each other, considering the constraints and the specific moves already made.
4. The logic in `func_1` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations. The base cases are initialized as `dp = [1, 1]`, representing the number of ways to place rooks on a 1x1 and 2x2 board, respectively.
5. For larger boards, the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)` is used to update the DP table. This formula accounts for the remaining positions and ensures that no two rooks are placed in the same row or column.
6. The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as described.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and follows the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
