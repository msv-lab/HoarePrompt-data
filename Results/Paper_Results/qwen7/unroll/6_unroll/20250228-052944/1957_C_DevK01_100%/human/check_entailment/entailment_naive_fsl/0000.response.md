Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the program subtracts 2 from `n` whenever a move is made where the row and column indices are different, and subtracts 1 when they are the same. However, this logic does not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. Each move reduces the number of available positions for placing rooks.
2. When a rook is placed at position (r, c), it eliminates all other positions in row r and column c.
3. The number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions can be calculated using combinatorial methods.

The provided solution does not account for the combinatorial nature of the problem. Instead, it attempts to reduce `n` based on the moves made, which is not sufficient to determine the number of valid configurations.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining rows and columns after each move, considering the constraints that no two rooks can attack each other. This requires a more complex combinatorial calculation, which is not implemented in the given code.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
