Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
   - `day` is 'AM'
   - `n` is an input integer

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `n`. The values of `t` and `day` do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0**
