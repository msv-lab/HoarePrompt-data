Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Sorting and Initial Calculation**: 
   - The program sorts the list `a` and starts with the smallest value. However, the problem requires maximizing the score by strategically buying additional cards to form contiguous subarrays that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Buying Cards Logic**:
   - The logic for buying cards is flawed. The program attempts to buy cards to reduce the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list. However, it does not account for the fact that buying cards should ideally help in forming more complete permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Residual Calculation**:
   - The residual calculation (`res`) is not correctly implemented. The program tries to add the remaining cards but does not properly account for how these cards can contribute to forming valid subarrays.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score calculation is incorrect. The formula `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and adding `res` does not accurately reflect the maximum score achievable.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify gaps in the sequence.
- Strategically buy cards to minimize these gaps.
- Ensure that the bought cards can form as many valid subarrays as possible.

A more effective approach would involve:
1. Identifying the longest prefix that is already a permutation.
2. Buying cards to extend this prefix to the full length `n`.
3. Calculating the score based on the number of valid subarrays formed.

Given the complexity, a dynamic programming or greedy approach might be more suitable. However, the provided code does not implement these steps correctly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
