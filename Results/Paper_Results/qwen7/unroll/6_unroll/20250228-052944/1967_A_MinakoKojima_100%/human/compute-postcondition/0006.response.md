Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and a list `a` containing `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The function processes these inputs but does not return any specific value or message directly from the given information.**

This means the function `func` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer within the range 1 to 100. It then processes `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. However, the specific processing and return value are not detailed in the provided information.
