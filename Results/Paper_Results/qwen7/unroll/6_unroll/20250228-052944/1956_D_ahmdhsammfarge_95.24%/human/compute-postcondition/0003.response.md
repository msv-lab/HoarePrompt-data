Output State: **`ops` is a list containing `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[l:r + 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. This means that the original list `ops` now contains two identical sublists `[r + 1, l + 1]`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
