The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The function returns a list containing [n, n], [n, r + 1], [n, n], and [n, r + 1].

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters r, l, lst (a list of non-negative integers), and ops (a list for storing operations). It returns a list containing [n, n], [n, r + 1], [n, n], and [n, r + 1].**
