You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where the length of lst is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18), and each element in lst is an integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:

    #State: Output State: `r` is the index `i` and `l` is the index `j` that maximize the value of `sm`, where `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, where `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns two indices, `r` and `l`, that maximize the value of `sm`. Here, `sm` is defined as the sum of elements before index `i` plus the sum of elements after index `j` plus the squared distance between the two indices `(j - i + 1)^2`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: r and l are integers such that 0 <= l <= r < n, and ops is a list that will store the operations performed.
def func_2(r, l, ops):
    if (r == l) :
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
        #The program returns a list containing [r + 1, l + 1]
    #State: `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The value of `r` is not equal to `l`.
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integers `r` and `l` and a list `ops`. It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops` under certain conditions. If `r` equals `l`, it directly appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and returns. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `l - 1` and then appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` twice before returning. The function ultimately returns a list containing the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)` and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed.

    #State: Postcondition: `ops` is a list containing `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[l:r + 1]` is 0, the function does not change the value of `ops`. There is no else part in the code, so the value of `ops` remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition is met or not.
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
    #The program returns a list containing [n, n], [n, r + 1], [n, n], and [n, r + 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst` (a list of non-negative integers), and `ops` (a list for storing operations). It appends specific lists to `ops`, calls another function `func_2`, modifies `lst` by replacing the sublist from index `r` to `l` with a list of the same length filled with the value `l - r + 1`, and returns the modified `lst`. The final state of `ops` includes specific lists appended during the function's execution, and the returned list `lst` contains a series of identical values based on the length of the specified sublist.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray.
   - This approach is flawed because the goal is to maximize the sum of the array by setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray, not by adding the square of the subarray length.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of operations based on the result from `func_1`.
   - However, the logic inside this function is also incorrect. It recursively appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times without actually performing the MEX operation.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the MEX operation and update the array.
   - The logic here is also incorrect. It unnecessarily appends the same operation multiple times and does not correctly compute the MEX value or update the array.

### Detailed Issues

- **Incorrect Objective**: The functions do not correctly implement the MEX operation or the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.
- **Redundant Operations**: The functions append the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
- **Logic Errors**: The functions contain logical errors that prevent them from achieving the desired outcome.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
