Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray.
   - This approach is flawed because the goal is to maximize the sum of the array by setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray, not by adding the square of the subarray length.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of operations based on the result from `func_1`.
   - However, the logic inside this function is also incorrect. It recursively appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times without actually performing the MEX operation.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the MEX operation and update the array.
   - The logic here is also incorrect. It unnecessarily appends the same operation multiple times and does not correctly compute the MEX value or update the array.

### Detailed Issues

- **Incorrect Objective**: The functions do not correctly implement the MEX operation or the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.
- **Redundant Operations**: The functions append the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
- **Logic Errors**: The functions contain logical errors that prevent them from achieving the desired outcome.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
