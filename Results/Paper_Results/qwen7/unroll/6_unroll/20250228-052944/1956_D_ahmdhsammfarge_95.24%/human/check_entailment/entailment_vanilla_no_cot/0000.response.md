Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the correct approach to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations.

#### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Objective**: The functions are trying to maximize the sum of the array by some means, but they do not correctly identify the optimal operations to perform. The current implementation seems to focus on partitioning the array and calculating sums, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Mex Calculation**: The problem requires computing the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of a subarray and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX value. The functions do not include any logic to compute or use the MEX value.

3. **Operation Application**: The operations need to be applied to subarrays to set their values to the MEX of those subarrays. The provided functions do not include this critical step.

4. **Output Format**: The functions do not produce the required output format, which includes the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Compute the MEX for each possible subarray.
- Apply operations to set the subarray elements to the MEX value.
- Ensure the operations are recorded and the final sum is maximized.

A more appropriate approach would involve:
1. Iterating through the array and computing the MEX for each possible subarray.
2. Applying the operation to set the subarray elements to the MEX value.
3. Recording the operations and updating the array accordingly.
4. Ensuring the operations do not exceed the limit of \(5 \times 10^5\).

Given the current implementation, the functions do not address these requirements, hence the correctness is **False**.
