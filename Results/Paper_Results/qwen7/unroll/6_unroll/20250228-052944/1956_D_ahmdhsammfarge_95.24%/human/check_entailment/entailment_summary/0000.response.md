### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations. Each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is defined as the sum of elements before index `i` plus the sum of elements after index `j` plus the squared distance between the two indices `(j - i + 1)^2`.
   - This approach seems to focus on finding a segment that can be modified to increase the overall sum, but it might not directly address the MEX concept.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is recursive and appends operations to `ops` in a way that doesn't seem directly related to the MEX concept or maximizing the sum.
   - The function's logic appears to be overly complex and might not contribute to the correct solution.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function sets a subarray to the MEX of that subarray and appends operations to `ops`.
   - It correctly identifies the MEX of the subarray and sets the entire subarray to that value.
   - However, the recursive call to `func_2` within `func_3` seems unnecessary and could be causing issues.

5. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program uses `func_1` to find the optimal segment, then uses `func_3` to set the segment to the MEX value.
   - It then iterates through the array to set any remaining zeros to 1, ensuring the array is filled with the highest possible values.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the array and the number of operations.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` might be causing unnecessary complexity and could lead to incorrect results.
   - The main program logic seems to handle the MEX concept correctly but might benefit from simplifying the recursive calls.

### Conclusion:
Given the execution summaries and the logic described, the program attempts to solve the problem but includes unnecessary and potentially incorrect recursive calls. The core logic of setting segments to their MEX values is present, but the additional complexity might lead to incorrect solutions or inefficiencies.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is not fully correct due to the presence of unnecessary and potentially incorrect recursive calls, which could lead to incorrect results or inefficiencies.
