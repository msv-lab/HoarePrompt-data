Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to address the core requirement of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. 

- **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to find the subarray that, when modified, would result in the maximum sum. However, it calculates the sum of elements outside the subarray and adds the square of the subarray length to the sum, which is not a valid approach for finding the optimal subarray to modify.

- **Function `func_2`**: This function recursively appends operations to a list but does not seem to be used effectively to maximize the sum. It simply appends operations without considering the actual impact on the sum.

- **Function `func_3`**: This function also seems to append operations without properly considering the impact on the sum. It modifies the subarray to a constant value but does not ensure that the value chosen is the MEX of the subarray, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
