### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \( r \) and \( l \) that maximize the value of \( sm = \text{sum}(lst[:i]) + \text{sum}(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2 \).
   - The logic is correct in identifying the indices that maximize the sum of the subarray plus the squared length of the subarray.
   - However, there's a potential issue: the function is designed to work with arrays of length up to 18, but the problem statement mentions that the length \( n \) can be up to \( 18 \). Therefore, the function is correctly implemented for the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function updates the array `lst` by setting all elements from index `r` to `l` to the value `n` (where \( n = l - r + 1 \)).
   - The function also appends operations to `ops` to reflect the changes made.
   - The logic here is correct, but there is a redundancy in appending `[r + 1, l + 1]` twice. This could be optimized to append it once.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function recursively constructs operations to ensure that the subarray from `r` to `l` is updated.
   - The function is correct in its recursive approach, but it has an unnecessary recursive call at the end, which can be removed for efficiency.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic iteratively uses `func_1` to find the best subarray to update and then calls `func_3` to perform the update.
   - The logic for updating the array and collecting operations is correct.
   - After processing, the program prints the final sum and the number of operations.

### Issues Identified:
- **Redundant Appends in `func_3`**: The line `ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])` is appended twice, which is unnecessary.
- **Unnecessary Recursive Call in `func_2`**: The last recursive call in `func_2` is redundant and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues identified, the overall logic of the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem. The program correctly maximizes the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations and collects the necessary operations.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct in terms of functionality and adheres to the problem constraints.
