Output State: **`ops` is a list containing `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(r, l, ops)` is called with parameters `r`, `l`, and `ops`. However, since the content of `func_2` is not provided, no changes are made to the `ops` list. Therefore, the `ops` list remains unchanged as specified in the initial state.
