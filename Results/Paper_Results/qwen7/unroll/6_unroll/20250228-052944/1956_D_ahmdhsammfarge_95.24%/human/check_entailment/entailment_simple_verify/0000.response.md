### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: To find the subarray indices `(r, l)` that maximize the sum of the modified subarray plus the square of its length.
- **Logic**: The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the subarray length. This is not a valid approach to find the optimal subarray to modify because it does not consider the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) value, which is crucial for the problem.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: To recursively append operations to a list.
- **Logic**: The function simply appends operations without any consideration of the actual impact on the sum. It does not use the results from `func_1` to determine the optimal operations.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Purpose**: To modify the subarray to a constant value.
- **Logic**: The function modifies the subarray to a constant value `n`, where `n` is the length of the subarray. However, it does not ensure that the value chosen is the MEX of the subarray, which is essential for maximizing the sum.

#### Main Program Logic:
1. **Finding Optimal Subarray**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray indices `(r, l)`.
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly calls `func_3` to modify the subarray until `r` equals `l`.

2. **Handling Remaining Zeros**:
   - After the loop, it tries to handle any remaining zeros by setting them to 1, which is not necessary and does not contribute to maximizing the sum.

### Evaluation:
- **Function `func_1`**: Incorrectly calculates the sum and does not find the optimal subarray based on the MEX value.
- **Function `func_2`**: Simply appends operations without considering their impact.
- **Function `func_3`**: Modifies the subarray to a constant value without ensuring it is the MEX value, which is crucial for maximizing the sum.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
