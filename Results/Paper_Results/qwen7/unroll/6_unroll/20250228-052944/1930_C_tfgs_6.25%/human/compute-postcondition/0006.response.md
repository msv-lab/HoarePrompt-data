Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a` which now contains unique elements from the original list; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where each element a[i] was initially a[i] + (i + 1) for 0 ≤ i < n, but now contains only unique values.**

Explanation: The line `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a list of unique elements by first converting it into a set (which removes duplicates) and then back into a list. The counter object `counter` still exists and counts the occurrences of each element in the modified list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
