Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a` which now contains unique elements from the original list; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The `reverse=True` parameter ensures that the sorting is done in descending order. The values of `counter` and `t` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to contain its elements sorted in descending order.
