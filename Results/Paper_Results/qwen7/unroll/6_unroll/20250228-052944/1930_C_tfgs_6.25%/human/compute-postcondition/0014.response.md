Output State: `counter` remains a Counter object with updated counts for each element in the list `a`, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `cnt` becomes 0 after all iterations of the loop, and `ans` is a list containing a sequence of integers where each element is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, starting from the last value in `ans` and continuing until `cnt` iterations have been completed.
