You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is initially a[i] + (i + 1) for 0 ≤ i < n, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `counter` is a Counter object with updated counts for each element in the list `a`, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `cnt` is reduced by the sum of `adv` values calculated during the loop, and `ans` is a list containing a sequence of integers generated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the remaining count of each element.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `counter` is a Counter object with updated counts for each element in the list `a`, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `cnt` is reduced by the sum of `adv` values calculated during the loop, and `ans` is a list where each element is reduced by 1 for each iteration of the loop, starting from the last element of `ans`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a predefined list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
