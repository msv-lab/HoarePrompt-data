### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the operations on an initially empty array `a`.
   - Operations can be of two types:
     - Append an integer `x` to the end of the array.
     - Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer `q` queries asking for the `k-th` element of the resulting array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simulates the operations and constructs the final array.
   - It correctly handles both types of operations:
     - Appending a single integer.
     - Extending the array by repeating its contents.
   - It then calculates the result for each query using the modulo operation to handle the potentially large size of the array.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, including `n`, `q`, the operations, and the queries.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the results and prints them.

4. **Verification:**
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to handle the operations and queries as described in the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` accurately simulates the array construction and handles queries correctly.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given that both functions together correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
