### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - It initializes an empty list `array` and an empty list `result`.
   - The first loop iterates through the `operations` list. For each operation:
     - If the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, it appends the value to `array`.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends `array` by repeating its current elements `value` times.
   - The second loop iterates through the `queries` list and appends the `(k-1) % len(array) + 1`-th element of `array` to `result`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input values for `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

3. **Problem Description vs. Implementation:**
   - The problem description requires maintaining the array correctly according to the operations and answering queries about specific elements.
   - The implementation in `func_1` correctly updates the `array` based on the operations. However, there is a critical issue in the second loop where the modulo operation is applied incorrectly. Specifically, the modulo operation should be applied to the index directly without adding 1, i.e., `array[(k-1) % len(array)]` should be `array[(k-1) % len(array)]`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` for updating the `array` is correct.
   - The logic for querying the `array` is incorrect because it should use `array[(k-1) % len(array)]` instead of `array[(k-1) % len(array)] + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because the modulo operation in the query part of `func_1` is applied incorrectly. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Correctness: **False**
