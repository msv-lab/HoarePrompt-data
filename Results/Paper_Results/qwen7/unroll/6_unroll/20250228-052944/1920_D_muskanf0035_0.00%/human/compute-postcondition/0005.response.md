Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `k` and the iterable `queries`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the objects involved**:
   - `array` is initially an empty list.
   - `result` is initially an empty list.

3. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the information given, the loop does not modify the `result` list at all. It only operates on the `array` by either appending a single element or extending the array with its own elements. Since the loop does not modify `result`, its state remains unchanged.

4. **Consider the impact of the loop on the objects**:
   - The `array` might change during the loop, but since the loop does not modify `result`, the state of `result` remains as an empty list.
   - The value of `k` will be each element from the `queries` list during each iteration of the loop.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `queries` must contain at least one element. If `queries` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The state of `result` should remain as an empty list because the loop does not modify it.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `queries` is not empty.
- Keep `result` as an empty list.

State: **`array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list, `queries` must contain at least one element, `k` is the current element from `queries`**
