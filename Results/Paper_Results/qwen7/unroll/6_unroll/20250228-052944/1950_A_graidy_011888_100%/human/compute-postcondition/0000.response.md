Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, maintaining its initial state where it is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
