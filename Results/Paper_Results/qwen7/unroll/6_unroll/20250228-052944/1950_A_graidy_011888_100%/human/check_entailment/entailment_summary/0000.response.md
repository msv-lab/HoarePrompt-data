Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks the conditions for a 'STAIR' and a 'PEAK' as specified in the problem statement.
3. The conditions for 'STAIR' and 'PEAK' are implemented correctly:
   - For 'STAIR': `a < b < c`
   - For 'PEAK': `a < b` and `b > c`
4. If neither condition is met, it correctly outputs 'NONE'.
5. The program handles multiple test cases as expected, printing the result for each one.

Given that the program logic matches the problem description and the execution summary accurately reflects the intended behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
