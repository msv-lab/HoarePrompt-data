### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its annotated version step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required operation and whether it can sort the array in non-decreasing order.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. We can take any element of the array that is at least 10, delete it, and instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in order they appear in that element.
2. The goal is to determine if it is possible to transform the array into a sorted array using this operation.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10, it attempts to split the previous element into its digits and reinsert them.
   - The reinsertion logic is flawed because it only splits the element and inserts the digits without ensuring the array remains valid after each operation.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It sorts the array and compares it with the original array to check if they are equal.

#### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Splitting and Reinsertion:**
   - The program does not correctly split the element and reinsert the digits in the appropriate positions.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program should split `28` into `[2, 8]` and insert them in the correct positions, resulting in `[2, 8, 5]`. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

2. **Lack of Correctness:**
   - The program does not ensure that the array remains valid after each operation.
   - The logic for splitting and reinserting digits is flawed and does not guarantee that the array will eventually become sorted.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the required operation and cannot guarantee that the array will become sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
