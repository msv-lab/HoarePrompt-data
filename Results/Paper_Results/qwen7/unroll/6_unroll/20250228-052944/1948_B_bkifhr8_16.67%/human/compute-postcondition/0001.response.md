Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

This means the program checks if the list `lst` is already sorted in the same order as `sorted_lst`, which is a sorted version of `lst`. The return value will be `True` if `lst` is sorted, otherwise `False`.
