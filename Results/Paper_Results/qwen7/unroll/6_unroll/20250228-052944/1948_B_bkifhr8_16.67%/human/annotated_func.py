#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) as input, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. After sorting the list, it checks if the original list `lst` is equal to the sorted list. The function then returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` was originally sorted in non-decreasing order.
