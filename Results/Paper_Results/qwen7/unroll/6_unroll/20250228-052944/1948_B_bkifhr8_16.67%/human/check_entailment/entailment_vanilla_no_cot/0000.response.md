Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting the digits of an element when it is greater than or equal to 10 is not implemented correctly. The program should only split elements that are at least 10, but it incorrectly splits elements even if they are less than 10.

2. **Repetition of Operations**: The program performs the digit splitting operation in a loop without checking if the array is already sorted after each operation. This can lead to unnecessary operations and may not terminate properly.

3. **Function `func_1` Redundancy**: The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted, but it is not used effectively in the main logic. Instead, the program should directly check if the list is sorted after performing the necessary operations.

4. **Output Format**: The output should be in uppercase ('YES' or 'NO') as specified in the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Perform the digit splitting operation until the array is sorted or no more operations can be performed
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('YES')
            break
        
        changed = False
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
                changed = True
        
        if not changed:
            print('NO')
            break
```

This corrected version ensures that the digit splitting operation is only performed when necessary and checks if the array is sorted after each operation. It also handles the output format correctly.
