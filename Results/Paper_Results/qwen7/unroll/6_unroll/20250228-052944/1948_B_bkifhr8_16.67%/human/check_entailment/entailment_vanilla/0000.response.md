Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the next element (`list1[p]`) and the current element is greater than 10, it performs the specified operation:
     - It removes the current element.
     - Inserts the digits of the removed element into the array in the same position.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing all elements, the program calls `func_1(list1)` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` sorts the array and checks if it matches the original array. If it does, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations:**
   - The program assumes that performing the operation once will always lead to a closer state towards sorting the array. However, the problem allows performing the operation multiple times, and the program does not account for this.
   - The logic inside the loop only handles one operation per element, but the problem statement allows multiple operations.

2. **Lack of Iterative Operation Execution:**
   - The program does not ensure that the array is processed until no more operations can be performed. This means it might miss out on making the array sorted if multiple operations are needed.

3. **Incorrect Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted, but the problem requires transforming the array to be sorted, not just checking if it is already sorted.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to handle the possibility of multiple operations and does not ensure the array is transformed to be sorted.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
