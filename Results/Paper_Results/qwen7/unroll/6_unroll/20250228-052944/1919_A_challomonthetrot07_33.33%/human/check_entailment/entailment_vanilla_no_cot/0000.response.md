Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal strategy. Here’s why the given solution is incorrect:

1. **Case Analysis**: The solution uses several conditions to determine the winner, but it doesn't fully cover all possible scenarios that would lead to a correct outcome. Specifically, it fails to handle the game state correctly when both players have more than one coin.

2. **Game Logic**: The game involves alternating moves where a player can either swap wallets or remove a coin. The key insight is that the player who faces a situation where they have an odd number of coins and their opponent has an even number of coins will lose if both play optimally. This is because the opponent can always force the player into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing a coin.

3. **Correct Solution**: A more accurate approach would be to check if the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd. If the sum is odd, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:
   - If the sum is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by ensuring the sum remains odd after each of Alice's moves.
   - If the sum is even, Alice can always ensure the sum remains even after each of Bob's moves, thus forcing Bob into a losing position.

Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This solution correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
