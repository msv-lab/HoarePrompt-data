You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and for each test case, a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and for each test case, a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list. After executing the loop, for each test case, the variable `result` holds the number of duplicate tokens in each line of input, where duplicates are counted based on the number of occurrences minus the number of unique tokens.
    #
    #In simpler terms, for each test case, the loop processes every second line starting from the third line of input (skipping the first two lines). It calculates how many tokens are repeated in each line by comparing the length of the split tokens with the length of the set of those tokens. The result for each line is printed but not stored elsewhere, so the final state retains the original lists of integers without any changes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers within specified constraints for each test case. For each test case, it checks the list and returns information based on the occurrences of integers within the list.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
