Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to calculate the number of unique tokens in a line of input, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. Specifically, the program does not account for the distribution of cards, the turns taken by the players, or the optimal strategy for Nene to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

To solve this problem correctly, the program needs to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation does not handle any part of the game logic, such as distributing cards, taking turns, or calculating scores based on the rules provided. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
