Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem described. The function aims to count the number of duplicate tokens in each line of input, which is not relevant to the game described. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given the rules of the game and the cards in your hand.

The function instead counts the number of duplicate elements in each line of input, which is a different and unrelated task. Specifically, it reads every second line starting from the third line of input, splits each line into tokens, and prints the difference between the length of the split tokens and the length of the set of those tokens. This operation does not consider the game logic, the distribution of cards, or the optimal strategy for either player.

Given this analysis, the function does not implement the solution required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
