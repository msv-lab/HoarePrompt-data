Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and for each test case, a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list. After executing the loop, for each test case, the output is the count of duplicate tokens in the input line.

In simpler terms, the output state remains the same in terms of variable ranges and conditions, but after running the loop, each test case will have an additional output which is the number of duplicate words (tokens) in the input line.
