You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (number of inputs), followed by an integer n and an array a of n positive integers. If n equals 2, it outputs the minimum value in a. Otherwise, it finds and outputs the second largest value among all possible triplets in the array a.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Handling Small Arrays:**
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints the minimum of the two elements.
   - This handles the base case where the array has only two elements, which is a special case since the median operation is not needed.

3. **Finding the Maximum Median:**
   - The program initializes `max` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array with a sliding window of size 3 (`i` ranges from 0 to `n-3`).
   - For each window `[a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2]]`, it sorts the window and checks if the middle element (`temp[1]`) is greater than the current `max`.
   - If it is, it updates `max` to this value.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all windows, the program prints the value of `max`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Base Case Handling:**
   - When `n == 2`, the program correctly prints the minimum of the two elements, which is the only possible value after any median operation on a two-element array.

2. **Median Operation:**
   - The program uses a sliding window of size 3 to find the maximum median value within the array.
   - However, the problem allows for choosing any subarray, not just windows of size 3.
   - The program only considers subarrays of size 3, which may not capture the true maximum median value for larger subarrays.

3. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the input `5 1 2 3 4 5`, the program outputs `4`, which is correct because the maximum median value across all possible subarrays is indeed 4.
   - For the input `2 1 2`, the program outputs `1`, which is also correct because the minimum of the two elements is 1.

### Conclusion:

While the program correctly handles the base case and provides the right output for the given examples, it does not fully implement the logic required to find the maximum possible median value for any subarray. The program only considers subarrays of size 3, which might miss the true maximum median value for larger subarrays.

Therefore, the program is **not** completely correct according to the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
