Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop index) and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head and it controls the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial state of `t`**: The initial state of `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
