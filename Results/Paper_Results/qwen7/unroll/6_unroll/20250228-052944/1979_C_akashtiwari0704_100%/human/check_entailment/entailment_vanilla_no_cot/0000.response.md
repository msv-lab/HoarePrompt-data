Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of LCM**: The LCM of the multipliers is calculated and then divided by each multiplier to get the bet amounts. This does not guarantee that the total bet amount will be strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

2. **Sum of Bets vs. Winnings**: The solution calculates the sum of the bet amounts and compares it to the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. However, this check is insufficient to ensure that the condition is met for all possible outcomes.

3. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve finding individual bet amounts for each outcome such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. One way to achieve this is to use a simple proportional distribution where the bet on each outcome is a fraction of the total bet amount, ensuring that the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

### Correct Solution Outline:
1. For each outcome, calculate the required bet amount as a fraction of the total bet.
2. Ensure the total bet amount is less than the winnings for each outcome.
3. Print the bet amounts for each outcome or `-1` if no valid distribution exists.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Find the minimum multiplier
        min_multiplier = min(a)
        
        # Calculate the total bet amount
        total_bet = sum([min_multiplier * (min_multiplier - 1) // (k - 1) for k in a])
        
        # Check if the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome
        if all(total_bet < k * (min_multiplier - 1) // (k - 1) for k in a):
            ans = [min_multiplier * (min_multiplier - 1) // (k - 1) for k in a]
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This solution ensures that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome, thus meeting the problem requirements.
