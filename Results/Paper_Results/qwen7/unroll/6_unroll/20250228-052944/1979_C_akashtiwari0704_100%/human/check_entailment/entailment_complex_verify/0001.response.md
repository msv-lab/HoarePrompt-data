### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic of the program and provides a detailed analysis of the example test cases. However, upon closer inspection, there are a few potential issues that need to be addressed:

1. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM calculation is crucial for determining the minimum total bet required. The program uses the `gcd` function to compute the LCM, which is generally correct. However, the LCM calculation could potentially lead to incorrect results if the multipliers are not handled properly.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program assumes that the LCM of the multipliers will always be sufficient to cover the required conditions. However, if the LCM is too large, the sum of the bets might still be greater than the smallest multiplier, leading to an incorrect result.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the bets after dividing each multiplier by the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. This logic seems correct, but we need to ensure that the LCM is indeed the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - The provided examples seem to work correctly, but we need to consider more complex scenarios to ensure the program handles all edge cases properly.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = [3, 2, 7]`
  - LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
  - Bets: `42/3 = 14`, `42/2 = 21`, `42/7 = 6`.
  - Sum: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
  - Since `41 < 42`, it prints the bets correctly.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = [3, 3]`
  - LCM of `[3, 3]` is `3`.
  - Bets: `3/3 = 1`, `3/3 = 1`.
  - Sum: `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Since `2 < 3`, it prints the bets correctly.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 5`, `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
  - Bets: `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`, `5/5 = 1`.
  - Sum: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
  - Since `5 >= 5`, it prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 6`, `k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`
  - LCM of `[7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]` is `19899`.
  - Bets: `19899/7 = 2843`, `19899/9 = 2211`, `19899/3 = 6633`, `19899/17 = 1171`, `19899/9 = 2211`, `19899/13 = 1531`.
  - Sum: `2843 + 2211 + 6633 + 1171 + 2211 + 1531 = 16590`.
  - Since `16590 < 19899`, it prints the bets correctly.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = [6, 3, 2]`
  - LCM of `[6, 3, 2]` is `6`.
  - Bets: `6/6 = 1`, `6/3 = 2`, `6/2 = 3`.
  - Sum: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
  - Since `6 >= 6`, it prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - `n = 5`, `k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3]`
  - LCM of `[9, 4, 6, 8, 3]` is `72`.
  - Bets: `72/9 = 8`, `72/4 = 18`, `72/6 = 12`, `72/8 = 9`, `72/3 = 24`.
  - Sum: `8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 61`.
  - Since `61 < 72`, it prints the bets correctly.

### Conclusion:

Upon re-evaluation, the program appears to handle the problem correctly for the given examples and edge cases. The LCM calculation and the subsequent sum check are logically sound. However, the original assessment did not explicitly address potential issues with the LCM calculation when the multipliers are not coprime or when the LCM is too large.

Given that the program passes all the provided test cases and the logic seems sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final: True**
