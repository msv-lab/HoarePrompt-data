The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` and a list of `bets` integers `a`. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list and then divides each integer in the list by this LCM. It sums these divided values. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it constructs a string containing the modified integers and prints this string. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
