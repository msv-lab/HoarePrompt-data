Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `s` is updated based on the input values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration, and 'Yes' or 'No' is printed accordingly for each iteration.

The initial values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration based on the comparison between `a` and the final value of `s` calculated within each iteration.
