Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. It calculates the minimum number of coins `s` that Sasha needs to ensure he can win any number of coins, given the constraints of the problem.
4. The formula used to calculate `s` is:
   \[
   s = 1 + \left(\frac{1}{k-1} + 1\right)^x
   \]
   This formula ensures that Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row while maintaining the ability to increase his bet size appropriately.
5. The program then compares `a` (the initial number of coins Sasha has) with `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
6. The logic in the program matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
