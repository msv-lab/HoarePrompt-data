Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. It calculates the value of `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can eventually have any number of coins `n`. This calculation is done using the formula `s = 1 + s // (k - 1)` iteratively for `x` times.
4. The logic behind the formula is that Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from losing up to `x-1` times consecutively. Each time he loses, he needs to double his bet (since he can't bet more than his current coins), and the formula accounts for this exponential growth.
5. Finally, it checks if Sasha's initial number of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If so, it prints 'Yes', indicating Sasha can guarantee having any number of coins `n`. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
