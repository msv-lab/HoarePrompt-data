### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and calculations used in the program. However, let's re-evaluate the program and the annotated code to ensure every aspect is thoroughly checked.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from 0 to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Condition Check and Output:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Detailed Analysis

#### Formula Explanation
The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` inside the loop is designed to simulate Sasha's betting strategy. Here's a detailed breakdown:

- **Initial Value**: `s = 1`
- **Loop Iteration**: For each iteration, `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.
  - `s // (k - 1)` gives the integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)`.
  - Adding 1 ensures that `s` increases by a factor related to `k`.

This formula effectively models the exponential growth of Sasha's coins based on the number of consecutive wins and the multiplier `k`.

#### Test Cases Analysis

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 7`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 1 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 1 + 1 = 9`
   - Since `7 < 9`, the output is "Yes".

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 1 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 1 + 1 = 9`
   - Since `1 < 9`, the output is "Yes".

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 3 15`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 1 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 1 + 1 = 9`
   - Since `15 > 9`, the output is "No".

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 3 6`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 2 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 2 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 2 + 1 = 7`
   - Since `6 < 7`, the output is "Yes".

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 3 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 3 + 1 = 3`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 3 // 3 + 1 = 4`
     - After 4 iterations: `s += 4 // 3 + 1 = 6`
   - Since `5 < 6`, the output is "Yes".

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 4 7`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 4 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 4 + 1 = 3`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 3 // 4 + 1 = 4`
     - After 4 iterations: `s += 4 // 4 + 1 = 6`
   - Since `7 > 6`, the output is "No".

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 88 1000000000`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 88 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `1000000000` is large enough, the output is "No".

8. **Eighth Test Case:**
   - Input: `25 69 231`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 69 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `231` is small compared to the exponential growth, the output is "No".

9. **Ninth Test Case:**
   - Input: `13 97 18806`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 97 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `18806` is small compared to the exponential growth, the output is "No".
