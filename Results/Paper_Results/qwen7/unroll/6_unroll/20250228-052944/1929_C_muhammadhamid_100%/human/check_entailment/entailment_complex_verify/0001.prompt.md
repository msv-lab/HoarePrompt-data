You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    9
    
    2 1 7
    
    2 1 1
    
    2 3 15
    
    3 3 6
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 4 7
    
    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `s` is updated based on the input values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration, and 'Yes' or 'No' is printed accordingly for each iteration.
    #
    #The initial values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration based on the comparison between `a` and the final value of `s` calculated within each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 1000 sets of inputs, where each set consists of integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each set, it calculates a value \( s \) using a specific formula and compares it with \( a \). If \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \), it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each set of inputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from 0 to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Condition Check and Output:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Reasoning

#### Formula Explanation
The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` inside the loop is crucial. Let's break it down:

- `s // (k - 1)` calculates the integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)`.
- Adding 1 to the result ensures that `s` increases by a factor related to `k`.

This formula essentially models how Sasha's strategy evolves over consecutive bets. Given the constraints, we need to verify if this approach correctly determines whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins.

#### Test Cases Analysis

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 7`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 1 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 1 + 1 = 9`
   - Since `7 < 9`, the output is "Yes".

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 1 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 1 + 1 = 9`
   - Since `1 < 9`, the output is "Yes".

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 3 15`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 1 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 1 + 1 = 9`
   - Since `15 > 9`, the output is "No".

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 3 6`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 2 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 2 + 1 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 4 // 2 + 1 = 7`
   - Since `6 < 7`, the output is "Yes".

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 3 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 3 + 1 = 3`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 3 // 3 + 1 = 4`
     - After 4 iterations: `s += 4 // 3 + 1 = 6`
   - Since `5 < 6`, the output is "Yes".

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 4 7`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s += 1 // 4 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s += 2 // 4 + 1 = 3`
     - After 3 iterations: `s += 3 // 4 + 1 = 4`
     - After 4 iterations: `s += 4 // 4 + 1 = 6`
   - Since `7 > 6`, the output is "No".

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 88 1000000000`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 88 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `1000000000` is large enough, the output is "No".

8. **Eighth Test Case:**
   - Input: `25 69 231`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 69 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `231` is small compared to the exponential growth, the output is "No".

9. **Ninth Test Case:**
   - Input: `13 97 18806`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 97 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `18806` is small compared to the exponential growth, the output is "No".
