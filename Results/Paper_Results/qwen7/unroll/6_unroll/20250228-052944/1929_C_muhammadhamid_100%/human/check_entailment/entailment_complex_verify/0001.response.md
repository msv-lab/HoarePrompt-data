### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic and the intended behavior of the program. However, let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure that the logic and the implementation are sound.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from 0 to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Condition Check and Output:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Detailed Analysis

#### Formula Explanation
The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can win any number of coins. This formula is derived from the idea that Sasha can double his money with each win, but he can only lose up to `x` times in a row.

- **Initial Value**: `s = 1`
- **Loop Iterations**: The loop runs `x` times, updating `s` each time.
  - After the first iteration: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - After the second iteration: `s = 2 + 2 = 4`
  - After the third iteration: `s = 4 + 4 = 8`
  - And so on...

This pattern shows that `s` grows exponentially with each iteration.

#### Test Cases Analysis

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 7`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 = 8`
   - Since `7 < 8`, the output is "Yes".

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 = 8`
   - Since `1 < 8`, the output is "Yes".

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 3 15`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 = 8`
   - Since `15 > 8`, the output is "No".

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `3 3 6`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 = 8`
   - Since `6 < 8`, the output is "Yes".

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 = 8`
     - After 4 iterations: `s = 8 + 8 = 16`
   - Since `5 < 16`, the output is "Yes".

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 4 7`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 1 iteration: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
     - After 2 iterations: `s = 2 + 2 = 4`
     - After 3 iterations: `s = 4 + 4 = 8`
     - After 4 iterations: `s = 8 + 8 = 16`
   - Since `7 < 16`, the output is "No".

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 88 1000000000`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 88 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `1000000000` is large enough, the output is "No".

8. **Eighth Test Case:**
   - Input: `25 69 231`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 69 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `231` is small compared to the exponential growth, the output is "No".

9. **Ninth Test Case:**
   - Input: `13 97 18806`
   - Calculation:
     - Initial `s = 1`
     - After 97 iterations, `s` grows exponentially.
   - Since `18806` is small compared to the exponential growth, the output is "No".
