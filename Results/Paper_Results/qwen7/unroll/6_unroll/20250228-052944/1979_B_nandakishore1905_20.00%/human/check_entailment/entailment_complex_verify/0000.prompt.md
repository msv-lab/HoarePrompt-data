You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    for i in range(int(input())):

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. For each test case, the output will be either `k`, `1`, `2`, or `k - q` depending on the values of `n` and `m`. Here, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `q` is calculated as \(2^{(p-1)}\) where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\), and then prints one of four possible values based on specific conditions involving \(k\): \(k\), \(1\), \(2\), or \(k - q\), where \(q\) is derived from the binary representation of \(k\). The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to calculate the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \(a\) and \(b\), but it does not actually implement the logic required to find this length. Instead, it tries to infer the length based on the difference between \(x\) and \(y\), which is not a valid approach.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `57 37`

According to the problem description, we need to find the longest common subsegment of the sequences generated by \(a_n = n \oplus 57\) and \(b_n = n \oplus 37\).

The sequences start as follows:
- For \(a_n = n \oplus 57\):
  - \(a_1 = 1 \oplus 57 = 56\)
  - \(a_2 = 2 \oplus 57 = 59\)
  - \(a_3 = 3 \oplus 57 = 58\)
  - \(a_4 = 4 \oplus 57 = 61\)
  - \(a_5 = 5 \oplus 57 = 60\)
  - \(a_6 = 6 \oplus 57 = 63\)
  - \(a_7 = 7 \oplus 57 = 62\)
  - \(a_8 = 8 \oplus 57 = 49\)
  - ...

- For \(b_n = n \oplus 37\):
  - \(b_1 = 1 \oplus 37 = 36\)
  - \(b_2 = 2 \oplus 37 = 39\)
  - \(b_3 = 3 \oplus 37 = 38\)
  - \(b_4 = 4 \oplus 37 = 33\)
  - \(b_5 = 5 \oplus 37 = 32\)
  - \(b_6 = 6 \oplus 37 = 35\)
  - \(b_7 = 7 \oplus 37 = 34\)
  - \(b_8 = 8 \oplus 37 = 45\)
  - ...

By manually checking, we can see that the longest common subsegment is \([41, 40, 43, 42]\), which has a length of 4. However, the program incorrectly outputs 41, which is not the length of the common subsegment but rather a value derived from the bitwise operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for this and potentially other cases, making it incorrect.
