Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each iteration \(i\), the values of \(n\) and \(m\) are read from input, and based on the conditions given in the loop, one of the following outputs is produced:

- If \(k = 2^j\) for some integer \(j\), then \(k\) itself is printed.
- If \(n = 0\) and \(m\) is odd, then \(1\) is printed.
- If \(n = 0\) and \(m\) is even, then \(2\) is printed.
- Otherwise, the output is \(k - 2^{p-1}\), where \(p\) is the number of bits in the binary representation of \(k\) excluding the '0b' prefix.

Each line of output corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop.
