The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `d`. `d` is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1, where n is the number of vertices in the graph. The function returns two integers, `v` and `u`, where `v` is the input integer `d` and `u` is another input integer. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `d` within a specific range and returns two integers, `v` and `u`, where `v` is the same as `d` and `u` is another integer input.**
