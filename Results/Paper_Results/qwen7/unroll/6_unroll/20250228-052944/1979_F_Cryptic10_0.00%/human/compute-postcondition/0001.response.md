Output State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing all vertices from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code `remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))` creates a new set called `remaining_vertices` that contains all integers from 1 to n. The original `remaining_vertices` set is replaced by this new set. The variable `path` remains unchanged as an empty list.
