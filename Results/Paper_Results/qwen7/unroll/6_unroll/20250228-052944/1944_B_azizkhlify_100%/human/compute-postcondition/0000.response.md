Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not being used within the loop body.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are inputs available from `input()`. The condition for the loop to continue is that there must be at least one more input to read.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop will run for each test case, the value of `t` determines how many times the loop will execute.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), this is already satisfied.
   - There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
