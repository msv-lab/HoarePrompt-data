Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lists `ans` for each test case, where each list contains integers generated based on the binary representation of `k` and padded to length `n` with zeros if necessary. Specifically, for each test case, the list `ans` will contain powers of 2 corresponding to the positions set in the binary representation of `k`, followed by zeros to make the total length of the list equal to `n`.
