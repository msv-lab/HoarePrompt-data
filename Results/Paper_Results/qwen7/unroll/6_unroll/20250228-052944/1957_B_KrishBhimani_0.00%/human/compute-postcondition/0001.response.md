Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line representing the output of one test case. For each test case, the line will contain a sequence of integers (0s and powers of 2) of length `n`. The specific sequence depends on the binary representation of `k` and the value of `n`.

For each test case:
1. Read the values of `n` and `k`.
2. Determine the positions (`i`) where `k` has 1s in its binary representation.
3. Construct a list `ans` based on these positions, ensuring it has exactly `n` elements.
4. If `c` (which counts through the positions) reaches `n-1`, append the remaining value needed to make the sum of `ans` equal to `k` to `ans`.
5. Pad `ans` with 0s to ensure it has `n` elements.
6. Print the constructed list `ans`.

The exact sequence in each line will vary depending on the input values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
