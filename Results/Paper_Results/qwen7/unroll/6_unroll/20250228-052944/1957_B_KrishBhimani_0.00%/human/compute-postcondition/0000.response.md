Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object involved here is the result of `int(input())`, which we will denote as `num_tests`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `num_tests` is a positive integer. Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `num_tests` must be within this range.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: The initial state before the loop starts is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `num_tests` (which is the input from the user) must be within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `num_tests`, ensuring it falls within the valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, num_tests must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ num_tests ≤ 10^4**
