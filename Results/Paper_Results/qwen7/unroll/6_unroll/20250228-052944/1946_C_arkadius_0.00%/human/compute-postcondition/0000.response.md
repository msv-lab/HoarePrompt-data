Output State: **stack is a list containing one tuple (s, False)**.

Explanation: The code initializes a stack with a single tuple `(s, False)`. The variable `tree` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and `x` remains unchanged. The stack now contains the starting vertex `s` and a boolean flag set to `False`.
