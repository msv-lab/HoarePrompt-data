Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other preconditions remain valid.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other conditions and constraints, such as the existence of `n` and the array `a` for each test case, remain unchanged and will be handled in subsequent code executions.
