Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
2. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution attempts to solve this by counting consecutive elements that are the same and finding the minimum count of such consecutive elements.
4. However, the logic in the provided code is flawed:
   - It only counts consecutive elements that are the same and finds the minimum count of such sequences.
   - This approach does not correctly determine whether the array can become non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The logic does not consider the structure of the array and the operations required to make it non-beautiful.
5. The provided solution does not handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty property of the array.
6. For example, in the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` can be made non-beautiful by removing one element (at index 3), but the provided solution would incorrectly return `1`.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
