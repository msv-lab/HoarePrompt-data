You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, where `a` is a list of integers. After executing the loop, `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same integer in each list `a`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, then `-1` is printed; otherwise, `ans` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same integer in the list `a`. If the list has only one element or the minimum segment length equals the list size, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
2. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution attempts to solve this by counting consecutive elements that are the same and finding the minimum count of such consecutive elements.
4. However, the logic in the provided code is flawed:
   - It only counts consecutive elements that are the same and finds the minimum count of such sequences.
   - This approach does not correctly determine whether the array can become non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The logic does not consider the structure of the array and the operations required to make it non-beautiful.
5. The provided solution does not handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty property of the array.
6. For example, in the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` can be made non-beautiful by removing one element (at index 3), but the provided solution would incorrectly return `1`.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
