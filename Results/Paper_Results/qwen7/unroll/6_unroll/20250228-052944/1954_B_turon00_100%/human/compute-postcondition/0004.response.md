Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies a set of test cases where for each test case, it receives an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function checks if the array `a` is beautiful for each set and returns a result based on the beauty condition for each array.**

Note: The actual logic for determining if the array is beautiful and the specific return values are not described here as per the instruction to focus only on parameters and return values.
