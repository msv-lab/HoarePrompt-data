Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The solution does not handle the case where the string `s` consists of a single unique character. In such cases, it should print "NO" because there is no way to rearrange a single character string to form a different string.

2. **Generating New String `r`**: The logic for generating the new string `r` is flawed. It tries to split the string into two halves and rearrange them, but this approach does not guarantee that `r` will be different from `s`. For example, for the string "co", the solution might incorrectly generate "oc" or "co" again.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, it should print "NO" for strings like "aaaaa" and "hhhhhhhhhh" since no rearrangement can produce a different string.

4. **Output Format**: The solution should strictly follow the format specified in the problem statement. It should print "YES" or "NO" followed by the new string `r` if applicable.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        if len(set(s)) == 1:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Generate a different string by swapping the first and last characters
            new_str = s[-1] + s[1:-1] + s[0]
            print(new_str)

func()
```

This corrected solution:
- Checks if all characters in the string are the same.
- If they are, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it generates a new string by swapping the first and last characters and prints "YES" followed by the new string.
