You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `find_max` does not properly handle the bitwise operations and conditions specified in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  3 2
  0 0 1
  ```

Expected output:
```
3
```

However, the current implementation will not produce the correct result. Let's walk through the logic:

1. For the array `[0, 0, 1]` and `x = 2`, we need to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `2`.

2. The function `find_max` is designed to split the array into segments based on the current bit position (`bit`). However, it does not correctly handle the bitwise OR condition across multiple segments.

3. In the given implementation, the function `find_max` only considers the current bit position and does not recursively check the OR condition across multiple segments. This leads to incorrect results.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the OR condition is satisfied across all segments. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, 30, x)

def find_max(cur_arr, bit, x):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
    
    max_segments = 0
    for segment in new_arr:
        if segment >> bit & 1:
            max_segments = max(max_segments, find_max([segment], bit - 1, x))
        else:
            max_segments = max(max_segments, 1 + find_max([segment], bit - 1, x))
    
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(max_segments, len(new_arr))
    else:
        return max_segments

# Test case
print(func_1([0, 0, 1], 2))  # Expected output: 3
```

This corrected version ensures that the OR condition is checked across all segments and handles the bitwise operations correctly.
