Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: cur_arr, a list of non-negative integers, and bit, an integer representing the current bit position. It returns the length of the list 'cur_arr' if the current bit is 0. Otherwise, it returns either -1 or the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr, depending on whether the current bit of the XOR operation is 1.**
