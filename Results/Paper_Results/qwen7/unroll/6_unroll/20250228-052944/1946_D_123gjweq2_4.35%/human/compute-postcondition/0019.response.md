Output State: **The program returns either -1 or the result of the function find_max(new_arr, bit - 1) depending on whether the current bit of xor is 0 or 1.**

Given the initial state:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered.
- `x` is an integer representing Yarik's favorite number.
- `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position does not match the value of the current bit of `xor`.
- `xor` is 0.
- `thing1` is either -1 or the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` depending on whether the current bit of `xor` is 0 or 1.

The code simply returns `thing1`. Since `thing1` is defined as `-1` if the current bit of `xor` is 0, or as the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` if the current bit of `xor` is 1, the program returns either -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
