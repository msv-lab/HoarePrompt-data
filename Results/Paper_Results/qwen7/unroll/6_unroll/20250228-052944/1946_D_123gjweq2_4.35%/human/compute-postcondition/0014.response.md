Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik, `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position matches the value of the current bit of `xor`, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is either -1 or the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` depending on whether the current bit of `xor` is 1 or 0.**
