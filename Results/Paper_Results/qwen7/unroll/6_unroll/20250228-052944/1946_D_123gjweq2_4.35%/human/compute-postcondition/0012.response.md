Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik, `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position is 1, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` assigns the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` to the variable `thing1`. The function `find_max` is called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments, but since the actual implementation of `find_max` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `thing1`. However, we know that `thing1` now holds the result of this function call. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
