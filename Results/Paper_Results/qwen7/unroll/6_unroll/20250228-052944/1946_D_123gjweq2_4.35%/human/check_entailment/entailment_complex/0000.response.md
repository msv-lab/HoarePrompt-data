Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed a given threshold `x`. The segments must be contiguous and form a chain where the end of one segment is the start of the next.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(arr, x)**: This function is incorrectly named and should be `find_max(arr, x)`. It currently returns the length of the array `arr` instead of performing the required operations. This function should call `find_max` with the appropriate parameters but is not doing so correctly.
   - **find_max(cur_arr, bit)**: This function is intended to recursively process the array based on the current bit position. However, the logic within the function is flawed:
     - It incorrectly handles the cumulative XOR and the decision-making process.
     - It does not properly account for the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement.
     - The base case (`bit == -1`) returns the length of `cur_arr`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The function should use the cumulative XOR to check if the segments satisfy the condition `(a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x`.
   - It should recursively split the array based on the current bit and determine the maximum number of valid segments.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The `func_1` function returns the length of the array instead of calling `find_max`, and the `find_max` function has incorrect logic for processing the array based on the bit positions.

Correctness: **False**
