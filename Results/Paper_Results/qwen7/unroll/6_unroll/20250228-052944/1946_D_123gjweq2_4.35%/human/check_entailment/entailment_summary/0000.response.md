Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `find_max` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Analysis of `find_max` Function:
- The function `find_max` is designed to process the array based on the current bit position and recursively determine the maximum number of segments that can be formed while ensuring the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments does not exceed `x`.
- The function uses a recursive approach to handle different bit positions, starting from the most significant bit (31) down to the least significant bit (0).
- The base case (`bit == -1`) returns the length of the current array, which represents the maximum number of segments if no further constraints apply.
- For each bit position, it splits the array into segments where the XOR of elements in the segment is zero up to the current bit. This helps in maintaining the constraint that the bitwise OR of the XORs of the segments does not exceed `x`.

### Analysis of `func_1` Function:
- The function `func_1` calls `find_max` with the array and the highest bit position (31).
- It returns the result of `find_max`, which should give the maximum number of segments that can be formed under the given constraints.

### Verification Against Problem Description:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments does not exceed `x`.
- The `find_max` function correctly handles this by processing the array bit by bit and ensuring the constraint is met.
- The `func_1` function correctly calls `find_max` with the appropriate parameters and returns the result.

### Edge Cases:
- The function handles edge cases like when no valid segments can be formed, returning -1.
- It correctly processes arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.

Given the detailed analysis, both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
