Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) of non-overlapping subarrays such that the cumulative XOR of each subarray does not exceed \( x \) when combined with the cumulative XORs of previous subarrays using the bitwise OR operation.
2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The main function `func_1` calls `find_max` with the entire array and the highest bit position (31).
   - The `find_max` function recursively processes the array by considering each bit position from the most significant to the least significant.
   - For each bit position, it splits the array into subarrays where the cumulative XOR up to that bit is zero and non-zero.
   - If the current bit of the cumulative XOR is zero, it continues to process the subarray where the cumulative XOR is zero.
   - If the current bit of the cumulative XOR is one and the corresponding bit of \( x \) is also one, it considers both the subarray where the cumulative XOR is zero and the rest of the array.
   - If the current bit of the cumulative XOR is one and the corresponding bit of \( x \) is zero, it stops further processing and returns the current result.
3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `find_max` correctly handles the splitting of the array based on the cumulative XOR at each bit position.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the function processes all relevant subarrays.
   - The final result is determined by the maximum number of valid subarrays found during the recursion.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
