Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
   - Since `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, the condition `i <= j` will always be true as long as `arr` is not empty (i.e., `len(arr) > 0`).

4. **Adjust the states if necessary**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`, so we can only adjust those.
   - The current values of `i` and `j` already satisfy the condition `i <= j`, so no adjustment is needed.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**
