Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the distance between any two points is a side length of the square, which is incorrect. The program calculates the squared distance between two points and prints the minimum of these distances, which will not necessarily give the correct side length of the square.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```

The correct area of the square should be 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the distance between (-1, 1) and (1, -1), which is \( \sqrt{8} \), and print 8 as the area. This is because the program does not properly identify the side lengths of the square.

To fix this, the program needs to identify the unique pairs of points that form the sides of the square and ensure that the calculated distances are consistent with the properties of a square.
