Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning `t` now holds the number of test cases, and no other variables have been defined or modified.
