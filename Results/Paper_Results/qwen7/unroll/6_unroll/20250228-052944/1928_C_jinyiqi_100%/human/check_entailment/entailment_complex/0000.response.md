Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly parses the input values `n` and `x`.

2. **Divisor Calculation**: The function `func_1(x)` calculates all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` and returns them in a specific order. This part of the program is correct.

3. **Condition Checking**: The program checks two conditions:
   - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
   - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`

   These conditions ensure that the settling pattern fits within the range of `n` positions. If either condition fails, no valid `k` can be found for that test case.

4. **Finding Valid `k` Values**:
   - For each valid divisor `s` from `func_1(n + x - 2)` and `func_1(n - x)`, the program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`. This ensures that the value of `k` derived from `s` satisfies the condition that Vasya's position `x` should be within the range of the settling pattern.

5. **Removing Duplicates**: The program uses a set to remove duplicate values of `k` before calculating the length of the resulting list.

6. **Output**: The program prints the count of unique valid `k` values for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
