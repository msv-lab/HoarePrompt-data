You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order, followed by their corresponding quotients.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received during the settling.

2. **Finding Possible Values of `k`:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - These conditions ensure that the total length of the settling sequence (which is `2k - 2`) is even, which is necessary for the sequence to repeat properly.

3. **Generating Divisors:**
   - The function `func_1(x)` generates all divisors of `x`. This is done by iterating from 1 to the square root of `x`, checking divisibility, and collecting both `i` and `x // i`.

4. **Filtering Valid `k` Values:**
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, the program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If true, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.

5. **Removing Duplicates and Printing Result:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The length of the set is printed, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Detailed Validation:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are correct because they ensure that the total length of the settling sequence is even, which is necessary for the sequence to repeat properly.

2. **Divisor Generation:**
   - The function `func_1(x)` correctly generates all divisors of `x`.

3. **Filtering Valid `k` Values:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the value of `k` derived from the divisor `s` is valid. This is correct because the sequence length `2k - 2` must be at least `2x`.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Using a set to remove duplicates before calculating the length is correct.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 2`
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The valid `k` values are 2, 3, 5, 6.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 1`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: The only valid `k` value is 2.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `76 4`
  - Expected Output: `9`
  - Explanation: The valid `k` values are 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `100 99`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - Explanation: There are no valid `k` values.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 500000000`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: The only valid `k` value is 2.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
