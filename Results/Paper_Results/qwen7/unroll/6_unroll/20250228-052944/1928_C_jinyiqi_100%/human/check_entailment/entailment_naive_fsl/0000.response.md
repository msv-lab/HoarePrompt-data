Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but the logic for determining valid values of `k` is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 1000000000`, `x = 500000000`

For this case:
- `(n + x - 2) = 1500000000 - 2 = 1499999998`
- `(n - x) = 1000000000 - 500000000 = 500000000`

The divisors of `1499999998` include `2`, and the divisors of `500000000` include `2`. However, the program incorrectly includes `2` as a valid value for `k` because `(2 + 2) / 2 = 2 >= x`.

However, according to the problem description, `k` must be greater than `1`. Therefore, `k = 2` should not be included in the output for this case. The program incorrectly includes `2` as a valid value for `k`.

To fix this, the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be replaced with `(s + 2) / 2 > x` to ensure that `k` is strictly greater than `1`.

Since the program does not handle this edge case correctly, the overall correctness is **False**.
