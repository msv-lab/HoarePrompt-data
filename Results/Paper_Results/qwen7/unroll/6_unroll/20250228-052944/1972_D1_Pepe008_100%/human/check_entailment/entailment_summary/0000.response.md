Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Formula**: The program uses a formula that does not match the problem statement. Specifically, the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not align with the requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **GCD Calculation Missing**: The program does not compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not correctly count the valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
