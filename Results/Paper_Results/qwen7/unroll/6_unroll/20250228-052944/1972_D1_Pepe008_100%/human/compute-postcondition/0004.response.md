Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function ensures that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function then performs operations based on these values but does not explicitly return anything from the function body.**

Note: Since the specific operations to be performed are not detailed in the provided information, the functionality description focuses on the constraints and input processing aspect.
