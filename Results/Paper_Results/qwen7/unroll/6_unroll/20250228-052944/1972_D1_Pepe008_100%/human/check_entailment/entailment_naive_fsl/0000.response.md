Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not align with the problem statement. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent checks do not accurately determine the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To illustrate, consider the test case (10, 8):

- According to the problem statement, we need to check pairs (a, b) such that `1 ≤ a ≤ 10` and `1 ≤ b ≤ 8`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The correct output for this test case should be 14, but the provided program outputs a different result.

A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition directly without using the given formula. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
