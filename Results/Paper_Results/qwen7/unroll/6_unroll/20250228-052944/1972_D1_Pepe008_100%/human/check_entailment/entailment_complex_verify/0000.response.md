### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Code Analysis:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)
```

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is used to calculate some value `x`. However, this formula does not seem to directly relate to the problem constraints.
   - The conditions inside the loop do not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This involves calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) for each pair and then checking the condition.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code mentions that the formula used does not align with the problem statement. This is correct because the formula provided does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the necessary checks.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used and the subsequent checks do not accurately determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final:
Final: **False**
