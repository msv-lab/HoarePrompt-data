Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is equivalent to `T` in this context) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The other conditions and constraints about `n` and `m` remain unchanged and are still valid.
