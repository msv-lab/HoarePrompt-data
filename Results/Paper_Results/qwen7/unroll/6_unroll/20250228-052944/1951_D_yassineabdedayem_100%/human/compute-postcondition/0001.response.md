Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The key variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state is given as `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0, and given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed a positive integer within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**
