Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78. After the loop executes all iterations, the value of `word` depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. The final value of `word` will be determined by the last input value of `n` within the loop.
