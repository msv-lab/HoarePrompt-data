Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78.**

The code initializes the variable `alphabet` with the lowercase English letters. This assignment does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `alphabet` is set to the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
