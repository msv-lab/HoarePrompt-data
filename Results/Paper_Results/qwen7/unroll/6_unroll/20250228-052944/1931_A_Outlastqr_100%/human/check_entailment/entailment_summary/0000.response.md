Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to generate the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded for each test case. However, there are several issues with the logic used to construct the words:

1. **Handling `n` Greater Than 52**: 
   - The program correctly handles this case by setting the first character to the character corresponding to `n - 53` and appending 'zz'.
   
2. **Handling `n` Between 28 and 52**:
   - This part of the logic is incorrect. The program should append 'a' at the beginning, the character corresponding to `n - 28` in the middle, and 'z' at the end. Instead, it incorrectly appends 'z' at the end.
   
3. **Handling `n` Equal to 27**:
   - The program correctly sets the word to 'aay' when `n` is 27.
   
4. **Handling Other Cases**:
   - For other values of `n`, the program correctly constructs the word as 'aa' followed by the character corresponding to `n - 3`.

Given these points, the program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is between 28 and 52. Therefore, the generated words for these cases will not be lexicographically smallest.

Correctness: **False**
