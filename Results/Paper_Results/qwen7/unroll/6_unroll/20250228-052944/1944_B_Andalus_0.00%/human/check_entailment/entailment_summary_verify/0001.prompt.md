You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lft = lst[:n]

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of 2n integers (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) along with two integers n and k. It outputs pairs of elements from the sorted left part of the list (lft) and single elements from both the left and right parts of the list (lft and rgt), printed in groups of up to k elements. If there are enough repeated elements in the left part, they will be printed in pairs first, followed by single elements. The same process is repeated for the right part of the list. If the total number of elements to be printed exceeds k, only up to k elements will be printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `lst` of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Finding Duplicates and Singles:**
   - The program iterates through `lft` to find duplicates (`ldb`) and singles (`sng`).
   - It sorts `lft` and checks adjacent elements to identify duplicates and singles.
   - It does the same for `rgt` to find duplicates (`rdb`).

4. **Constructing Arrays `l` and `r`:**
   - The program tries to construct arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` using the identified duplicates and singles.
   - It prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Handling Duplicates and Singles:**
   - The logic for identifying duplicates and singles is correct. However, the approach might not always ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal.
   - The program only considers the first occurrence of each duplicate and single, which might not be sufficient to guarantee the XOR condition.

2. **Ensuring XOR Condition:**
   - The program does not explicitly check or balance the XOR values of `l` and `r`. It simply prints elements from the lists without ensuring the XOR condition is met.
   - This could lead to incorrect outputs where the XOR values of `l` and `r` are not equal.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the XOR condition cannot be satisfied with the current approach.
   - For example, if the XOR of the first half is significantly different from the XOR of the second half, the current method might fail.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` will always be equal. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all test cases.
