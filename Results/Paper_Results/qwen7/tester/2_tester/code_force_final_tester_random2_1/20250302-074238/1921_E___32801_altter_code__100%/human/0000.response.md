- **Input**:
```plaintext
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Bob
```
- **Explanation**: Bob can move his chip up to capture Alice's chip.

#### Test 3: Draw when Alice is in the Last Row
- **Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw when Alice is in the last row.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is in the last row and cannot move further.

#### Test 4: Draw when Bob is in the First Row

- **Input**:
```plaintext
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Bob is in the first row and cannot move further.

#### Test 5: Draw when Both Players are Trapped
- **Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw when both players are trapped.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
4 4 1 1 4 4
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Both players are in positions where they cannot move further.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6: Large Board Dimensions
- **Objective**: Verify the function handles large board dimensions.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can move her chip diagonally to capture Bob's chip.

#### Test 7: Alice and Bob are Close but Not Capturable
- **Objective**: Verify the function handles close but non-capturable positions.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Alice and Bob are close but cannot capture each other due to board boundaries.

#### Test 8: Alice and Bob are Far Apart
- **Objective**: Verify the function handles far-apart positions.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Draw
```
- **Explanation**: Alice and Bob are far apart and cannot capture each other.

#### Test 9: Bob is in the First Row but Alice is Not
- **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where Bob is in the first row but Alice is not.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Bob
```
- **Explanation**: Bob is in the first row and cannot move further, so Alice wins.

#### Test 10: Alice is in the Last Row but Bob is Not
- **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where Alice is in the last row but Bob is not.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice is in the last row and cannot move further, so Bob wins.

#### Test 11: Alice and Bob are Diagonally Opposite
- **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where Alice and Bob are diagonally opposite.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can move her chip diagonally to capture Bob's chip.

#### Test 12: Alice and Bob are at the Same Column
- **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where Alice and Bob are at the same column.
- **Input**:
```plaintext
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
- **Output**:
```plaintext
Alice
```
- **Explanation**: Alice can move her chip down to capture Bob's chip.
