To address the given problem, we need to implement a solution that maximizes the score by pairing the smallest elements together in each step. Below are the comprehensive test cases, both basic and edge scenarios, to ensure the solution's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
1
2 3
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
2
3
```

#### Explanation:
- For the first test case, the optimal pair is (2, 3), resulting in a score of 2.
- For the second test case, the optimal pairs are (1, 1) and (1, 2), resulting in a score of 2.
- For the third test case, the optimal pairs are (1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 1), resulting in a score of 3.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
2
2
4 5
3
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
9
```

#### Explanation:
- For the first test case, the optimal pairs are (4, 5), resulting in a score of 4.
- For the second test case, the optimal pairs are (3, 3), (3, 3), and (3, 3), resulting in a score of 9.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1
10000000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
- There is only one element, so no valid pairs can be formed, resulting in a score of 0.

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2
10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
10000000
```

#### Explanation:
- The optimal pair is (10000000, 10000000), resulting in a score of 10000000.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

#### Explanation:
- The optimal pairs are (1, 2) and (2, 3), but since we can only choose one pair at a time, the best strategy is to pair (1, 2) first, resulting in a score of 1 + 2 = 3.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Explanation:
- The optimal pairs are (1, 2) and (3, 4), resulting in a score of 1 + 3 = 4.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

#### Explanation:
- The optimal pairs are (1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 1), resulting in a score of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Explanation:
- The optimal pairs are (1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 1), resulting in a score of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### Summary
These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, ensuring the solution handles various inputs correctly and efficiently.
