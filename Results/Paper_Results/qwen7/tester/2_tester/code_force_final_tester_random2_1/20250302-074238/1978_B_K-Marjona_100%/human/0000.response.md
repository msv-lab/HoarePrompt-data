5 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1000000000 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 1000000000 + 999999999 + \ldots + 1 = 1000000000000000000 \).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 1 \). Then he will sell one bun for 1 coin, and nine hundred ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine buns at the usual price for 1000000000 coins each. The total profit is \( 1 + 1000000000 \times 999999999 = 1000000000000000000 \).

# Test 7

**Output**: 
```
500500
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 1000 \times 1000 = 500500 \).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: There is only one bun, so \( k = 0 \) is the optimal choice. The profit is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Since the price of the first bun is 2, which is higher than the usual price of 1, \( k = 0 \) is the optimal choice. The profit is \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Since the price of the first bun is 0, which is lower than the usual price of 1, \( k = 1 \) is the optimal choice. The profit is \( 0 + 1 \times 1 = 1 \).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
110
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 10 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + \ldots + 1 = 66 \). However, since there are only 10 buns, the profit is \( 11 + 10 \times 10 = 110 \).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 9
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 0 \). Then he will sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: It is optimal for Bob to choose \( k = 5 \). Then he will sell five buns at the modified price and five buns at the usual price. The profit is \( (10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6) + (1 \times 5) = 55 \).
