# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is the provided example where the solution is already given. We expect the same output.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Here, all multipliers are the same (5), and thus it is impossible to find a distribution where the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This is another provided example where the solution is given. We expect the same output.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: Here, the multipliers are such that no matter how we distribute the coins, the total bet cannot be strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This is another provided example where the solution is given. We expect the same output.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: For a single outcome, the only valid bet is 1 coin since the multiplier is 2, and 1 < 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: Similar to the previous test, but with a higher multiplier. The only valid bet is 1 coin since the multiplier is 20, and 1 < 20.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: With a multiplier of 10, it is impossible to find a valid bet since 1 * 10 = 10, which is not strictly less than 10.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: With a multiplier of 1, it is impossible to find a valid bet since 1 * 1 = 1, which is not strictly less than 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: With both multipliers being 2, it is impossible to find a valid bet since 1 * 2 = 2, which is not strictly less than 2.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: With multipliers 3 and 4, the smallest valid bets are 1 and 1 respectively, since 1 * 3 = 3 and 1 * 4 = 4, both of which are strictly greater than the respective bets.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2 2 
```
*Explanation*: With multipliers 4 and 3, the smallest valid bets are 2 and 2 respectively, since 2 * 4 = 8 and 2 * 3 = 6, both of which are strictly greater than the respective bets.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: With multipliers 2, 3, and 4, the smallest valid bets are 1, 1, and 1 respectively, since 1 * 2 = 2, 1 * 3 = 3, and 1 * 4 = 4, all of which are strictly greater than the respective bets.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3
5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: With all multipliers being 5, it is impossible to find a valid bet since 1 * 5 = 5, which is not strictly less than 5.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 6 6
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: With all multipliers being 6, it is impossible to find a valid bet since 1 * 6 = 6, which is not strictly less than 6.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
3
7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: With multipliers 7, 8, and 9, the smallest valid bets are 1, 1, and 1 respectively, since 1 * 7 = 7, 1 * 8 = 8, and 1 * 9 = 9, all of which are strictly greater than the respective bets.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: With all multipliers being 10, it is impossible to find a valid bet since 1 * 10 = 10, which is not strictly less than 10.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
3
11 12 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: With multipliers 11, 12, and 13, the smallest valid bets are 1, 1, and 1 respectively, since 1 * 11 = 11, 1 * 12 = 12, and 1 * 13 = 13, all of which are strictly greater than the respective bets.

# Test 20
