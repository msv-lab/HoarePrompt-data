# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small input size where Kirill needs to move to the first position.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 4 to position 1. He will pay 2 coins to the person at position 3 and 4 coins to the person at position 2, and 4 coins to the person at position 1. Total cost = 2 + 4 + 4 = 10.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small input size where Kirill needs to move to the second position.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 4 to position 2. He will pay 3 coins to the person at position 3 and 4 coins to the person at position 1. Total cost = 3 + 4 = 7.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small input size where Kirill needs to move to the last position.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Kirill already stands at the last position, so no coins are needed.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a medium-sized input where Kirill needs to move to the third position.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 6 to position 3. He will pay 5 coins to the person at position 5, 6 coins to the person at position 4, and 4 coins to the person at position 2. Total cost = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a medium-sized input where Kirill needs to move to the fifth position.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 5
1 2 3 4 5 6
2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 6 to position 5. He will pay 6 coins to the person at position 4, 5 coins to the person at position 3, and 4 coins to the person at position 2. Total cost = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15. However, since he only needs to move to position 5, the correct cost is 6 + 5 = 11.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a large input size where Kirill needs to move to the second position.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 10 to position 2. He will pay 9 coins to the person at position 9, 8 coins to the person at position 8, 7 coins to the person at position 7, 6 coins to the person at position 6, 5 coins to the person at position 5, 4 coins to the person at position 4, 3 coins to the person at position 3, and 2 coins to the person at position 1. Total cost = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 44. However, since he only needs to move to position 2, the correct cost is 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 44. But considering the problem constraints and the need to minimize, the correct cost is 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 44.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a large input size where Kirill needs to move to the seventh position.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 10 to position 7. He will pay 9 coins to the person at position 9, 8 coins to the person at position 8, 7 coins to the person at position 7. Total cost = 9 + 8 + 7 = 24.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a large input size where Kirill needs to move to the last position.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Kirill already stands at the last position, so no coins are needed.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where Kirill cannot move to any position within the allowed limit.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 5 to position 2. He will pay 4 coins to the person at position 4, 3 coins to the person at position 3, 2 coins to the person at position 2. Total cost = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where Kirill needs to move to the maximum allowed position.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Kirill already stands at the last position, so no coins are needed.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where Kirill needs to move to the first position.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 5 to position 1. He will pay 4 coins to the person at position 4, 3 coins to the person at position 3, 2 coins to the person at position 2, and 1 coin to the person at position 1. Total cost = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the input size is the maximum allowed.
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
**Output**: 
```
50000500000
```
**Explanation**: Kirill needs to move from position 200000 to position 100000. He will pay 99999 coins to the person at position 199999, 99998 coins to the person at position 199998, and so on until position 100000. Total cost = 99999 + 99998 + ... + 100000 = 50000500000.

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the input size is the maximum allowed and Kirill needs to move to the maximum allowed position.
**Input**: 
```
