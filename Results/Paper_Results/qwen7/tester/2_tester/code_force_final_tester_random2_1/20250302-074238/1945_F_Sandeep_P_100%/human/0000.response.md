To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small input where no magic power becomes zero.
**Input**:
```
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
16 2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick mushrooms at indices 1 and 2, giving a strength of \(2 \times \min(9, 8) = 16\).

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the permutation is the same as the index order.
**Input**:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
15 5
```
**Explanation**: Since the permutation is the same as the index order, all mushrooms are used, and the strength is \(5 \times \min(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 5 \times 1 = 5\). However, the problem asks for the minimum number of mushrooms needed, so the correct answer is 5.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the permutation reverses the order.
**Input**:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
8 2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick mushrooms at indices 5 and 6, giving a strength of \(2 \times \min(5, 6) = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works when some elements become zero.
**Input**:
```
5
1 4 6 10 10
2 1 4 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick mushrooms at indices 1 and 4, giving a strength of \(2 \times \min(1, 10) = 2 \times 1 = 2\), but since the problem asks for the minimum number of mushrooms needed, the correct answer is 2.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works when all elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
4
2 2 5 5
4 2 3 1
```
**Output**:
```
5 1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick any one mushroom, giving a strength of \(1 \times 2 = 2\), but since the problem asks for the minimum number of mushrooms needed, the correct answer is 1.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works when the permutation is a cyclic shift.
**Input**:
```
5
1 2 9 10 10
1 4 2 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick mushrooms at indices 2 and 3, giving a strength of \(2 \times \min(2, 9) = 2 \times 2 = 4\), but since the problem asks for the minimum number of mushrooms needed, the correct answer is 2.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large input where no magic power becomes zero.
**Input**:
```
200000
1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (200000 times)
1 2 3 ... 200000 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000 200000
```
**Explanation**: All mushrooms have the same magic power, and the optimal choice is to pick all mushrooms, giving a strength of \(200000 \times 1000000000 = 100000000000000\).

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large input where many magic powers become zero.
**Input**:
```
200000
1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (100000 times), 1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (100000 times)
1 2 3 ... 100000 100001 100002 ... 200000 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000 100000
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick the first 100000 mushrooms, giving a strength of \(100000 \times 1000000000 = 100000000000000\).

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large input where the permutation is a reverse.
**Input**:
```
200000
1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (200000 times)
200000 199999 ... 1 (200000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000 200000
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick all mushrooms, giving a strength of \(200000 \times 1000000000 = 100000000000000\).

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large input where the permutation is a random shuffle.
**Input**:
```
200000
1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 (200000 times)
random permutation of 1 to 200000
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000 200000
```
**Explanation**: The optimal choice is to pick all mushrooms, giving a strength of \(200000 \times 1000000000 = 100000000000000\).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
