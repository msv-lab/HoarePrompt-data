**Explanation**: Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 3 results in two connected components: one with 2 nodes (nodes 1 and 2) and another with 3 nodes (nodes 3, 4, and 5). The smallest component has 2 nodes, which matches the expected output.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Removing any edge leaves only one node in the remaining component, so the smallest component size is 1.
