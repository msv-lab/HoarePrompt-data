# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) and its friendship value is initially 1. Each time they are picked, their friendship value increases by 1. Therefore, the total sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
*Explanation*: The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 1. In the first excursion, the value is 1, and in the second excursion, it becomes 2. Thus, the total sum is 1 + 2 = 3 for the first excursion and 2 + 3 = 5 for the second excursion, giving a total of 11.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
*Explanation*: The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 25 and (3, 2) has an initial friendship value of 24. For the first excursion, the total sum is 25 + 24 = 49. For the second excursion, the value of (1, 2) increases to 26 and (3, 2) remains 24, making the sum 26 + 24 = 50. Similarly, for the third and fourth excursions, the sums are 27 + 24 = 51 and 28 + 24 = 52, respectively. Thus, the total sum is 49 + 50 + 51 + 52 = 202. Since \(202 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 40000020\), the output is 40000020.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for the single excursion, hence the friendship value for the excursion is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Each pair (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) has an initial friendship value of 1. Since only one excursion is performed, the total sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 2
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
*Explanation*: Each pair (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 1) has an initial friendship value of 1. After the first excursion, the friendship value of each pair increases to 2. Thus, the total sum after two excursions is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
*Explanation*: The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 1. In the first excursion, the value is 1, and in the second excursion, it becomes 2. Thus, the total sum is 1 + 2 = 3 for the first excursion and 2 + 3 = 5 for the second excursion, giving a total of 12.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
21
```
*Explanation*: Each pair (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) has an initial friendship value of 1. After the first excursion, the friendship value of each pair increases to 2. After the second excursion, the friendship value of each pair increases to 3. After the third excursion, the friendship value of each pair increases to 4. Thus, the total sum after three excursions is 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
75
```
*Explanation*: Each pair (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 1) has an initial friendship value of 1. After each excursion, the friendship value of each pair increases by 1. Thus, after five excursions, the friendship value of each pair is 6. The total sum is 6 * 5 = 30 for each pair, resulting in a total of 30 * 5 = 150 / 2 = 75 (since each pair is counted twice).

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles various input sizes and configurations correctly.
