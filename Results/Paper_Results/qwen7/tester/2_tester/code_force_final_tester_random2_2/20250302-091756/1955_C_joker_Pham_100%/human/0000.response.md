# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The first and last ships sink after the Kraken's attacks, resulting in 2 ships being sunk.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: After the first 5 attacks, the first and last ships sink. The sixth attack reduces the durability of the middle ship from 2 to 1, but it does not sink because there are still other ships left to attack.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: All ships will eventually sink as the Kraken continues to attack until all ships are sunk.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The first attack reduces the durability of the first ship from 3 to 2, but it does not sink. The second attack reduces the durability of the second ship from 2 to 1, but it also does not sink. No ships are sunk after 2 attacks.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 15
1 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Both ships will sink after 15 attacks since the first ship will sink after the 1st attack and the second ship will sink after the 15th attack.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 7
5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The first attack reduces the durability of the first ship from 5 to 4, but it does not sink. The second attack reduces the durability of the second ship from 4 to 3, but it does not sink. This pattern continues until both ships sink after 7 attacks.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
10 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The first attack reduces the durability of the first ship from 10 to 9, but it does not sink. The second attack reduces the durability of the third ship from 1 to 0, causing it to sink. No further attacks are made since the third ship is the only one left to attack.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
10 5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The first attack reduces the durability of the first ship from 10 to 9, but it does not sink. The second attack reduces the durability of the third ship from 1 to 0, causing it to sink. No further attacks are made since the third ship is the only one left to attack.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Both ships do not sink as the Kraken can only make one attack, which does not reduce any ship's durability to 0.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Each ship's durability is reduced by 1, but none of them sink as their durability remains positive.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: All ships will eventually sink as the Kraken continues to attack until all ships are sunk.

**Input**: 
```
1
2 1000000000
