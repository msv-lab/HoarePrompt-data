# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. After applying one operation to the first element, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median is 3. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. After applying two operations to the last two elements, the array becomes [7, 3, 3, 3], and the median is 3. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. After applying one operation to the only element, the array remains [1000000000], but the median increases to 1000000001, which is not necessary since we only need to make the median greater than the current value. Thus, no operations are needed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. After applying three operations to the last element, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 4, 6], and the median is 5. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. After applying two operations to the first two elements, the array becomes [3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4], and the median is 2. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1. After applying two operations to the first element, the array becomes [3, 2], and the median is 2. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. After applying three operations to the first element, the array becomes [4, 1], and the median is 2. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. After applying four operations to the last element, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 6], and the median is 5. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
3
2 2 8
4
7 3 3 1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
1
```
*Explanation*: This test case combines the previous basic test cases into a single input for efficiency. The outputs are the same as the individual test cases.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
5
5 5 5 4 5
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
2
2
```
*Explanation*: This test case also combines multiple basic test cases into a single input for efficiency. The outputs are the same as the individual test cases.
