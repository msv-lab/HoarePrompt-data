```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem description. It includes a typical scenario with multiple queries and verifies the correctness of the solution.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 10
2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are only two cities. The closest city to each city is itself, and traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 100 200
3
1 3
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the cities are evenly spaced. The closest city to each city is exactly one step away, and traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 3 7 15 31
6
1 6
6 1

2
2
8
8
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a more complex scenario with an odd number of cities and multiple queries. It ensures the solution handles non-evenly spaced cities correctly.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
3
3
2
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the cities are not evenly spaced but still have unique closest cities. It ensures the solution handles non-linear spacing correctly.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a larger dataset with 10 cities and multiple queries. It ensures the solution scales well and handles larger inputs correctly.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1000000000
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the maximum possible coordinate value is used. It ensures the solution handles large numbers correctly.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1000000000 2000000000
3
1 3
3 1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the cities are at the boundaries of the allowed range. It ensures the solution handles boundary conditions correctly.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the cities are adjacent. The closest city to each city is itself, and traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1000000000 2000000000
3
1 3
3 1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the cities are at the boundaries of the allowed range and are not evenly spaced. It ensures the solution handles edge cases correctly.
