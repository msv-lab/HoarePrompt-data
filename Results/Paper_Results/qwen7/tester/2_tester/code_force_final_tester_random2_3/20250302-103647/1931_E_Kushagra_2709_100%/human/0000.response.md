# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna can only reverse 2 to 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Thus, Sasha wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse 9 to 9, 56 to 65, and 1 to 1. No matter what Sasha does, Anna can always leave a number less than \(10^5\) after her turn. Sasha cannot concatenate two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^5\), so Anna wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse 1 to 1, 2007 to 7002, 800 to 800, and 1580 to 851. Sasha can concatenate 2007 and 800 to form 2007800, which is greater than \(10^{10}\). Thus, Sasha wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse 5000 to 5000, 123 to 321, 30 to 30, and 4 to 4. No matter what Sasha does, Anna can always leave a number less than \(10^5\) after her turn. Sasha cannot concatenate two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^5\), so Anna wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse the numbers, but Sasha can always concatenate two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^{10}\). For example, Sasha can concatenate 10 and 9 to form 109, which is greater than \(10^{10}\). Thus, Sasha wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: There is only one number, and Anna wins immediately because the number is less than \(10^1\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse 10 to 10, but Sasha can concatenate 10 and 10 to form 1010, which is greater than \(10^{10}\). Thus, Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse the numbers, and no matter what Sasha does, Anna can always leave a number less than \(10^5\) after her turn. Sasha cannot concatenate two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^5\), so Anna wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse the numbers, but Sasha can always concatenate two numbers to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^5\). For example, Sasha can concatenate 10 and 10 to form 1010, which is greater than \(10^5\). Thus, Sasha wins.
