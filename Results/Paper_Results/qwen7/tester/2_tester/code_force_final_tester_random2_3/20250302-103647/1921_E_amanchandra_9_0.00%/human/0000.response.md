To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Alice Wins by Capturing Bob's Chip
**Objective**: Verify that Alice wins if she can capture Bob's chip.

**Input**:
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (3, 3), capturing Bob's chip at (3, 3).

#### Test 2: Bob Wins by Capturing Alice's Chip
**Objective**: Verify that Bob wins if he can capture Alice's chip.

**Input**:
```
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Bob can move to (3, 1), capturing Alice's chip at (3, 1).

#### Test 3: Draw if Alice is in Last Row and Bob is in First Row
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row.

**Input**:
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the last row (1, 3), and Bob is in the first row (1, 1). Neither can make a move, so the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 4: Draw if Both Chips are in the Same Column but Different Rows
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if both chips are in the same column but different rows.

**Input**:
```
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 4) and Bob is at (5, 2). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5: Alice is in Last Row and Bob is in First Row with Large Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row on a large board.

**Input**:
```
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 6) and Bob is at (10, 8). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 6: Alice is in Last Row and Bob is in First Row with Small Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row on a small board.

**Input**:
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 3) and Bob is at (1, 1). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 7: Alice and Bob are in the Same Column but Different Rows with Large Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice and Bob are in the same column but different rows on a large board.

**Input**:
```
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (2, 6) and Bob is at (10, 7). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 8: Alice and Bob are in the Same Column but Different Rows with Small Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice and Bob are in the same column but different rows on a small board.

**Input**:
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 3) and Bob is at (1, 1). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 9: Alice and Bob are in Different Columns but Same Row with Large Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice and Bob are in different columns but the same row on a large board.

**Input**:
```
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (9, 1) and Bob is at (8, 1). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 10: Alice and Bob are in Different Columns but Same Row with Small Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice and Bob are in different columns but the same row on a small board.

**Input**:
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 3) and Bob is at (1, 1). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 11: Alice and Bob are in Different Rows and Columns with Large Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice and Bob are in different rows and columns on a large board.

**Input**:
```
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (8, 1) and Bob is at (10, 2). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.

#### Test 12: Alice and Bob are in Different Rows and Columns with Small Board
**Objective**: Verify that the game ends in a draw if Alice and Bob are in different rows and columns on a small board.

**Input**:
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is at (1, 3) and Bob is at (1, 1). They cannot capture each other, and neither can move out of their current positions, resulting in a draw.
