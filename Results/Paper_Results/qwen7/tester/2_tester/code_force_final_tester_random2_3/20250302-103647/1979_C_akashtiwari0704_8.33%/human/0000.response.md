# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where we need to distribute coins such that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. The given solution satisfies the condition.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: Another basic test case where the smallest possible bets are used to satisfy the condition.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case shows a situation where no valid distribution exists because the minimum bet required to win would be equal to the total bet, which violates the strict inequality condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic test case where we need to distribute coins such that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. The given solution satisfies the condition.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case shows a situation where no valid distribution exists because the minimum bet required to win would be equal to the total bet, which violates the strict inequality condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic test case where we need to distribute coins such that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. The given solution satisfies the condition.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1
2
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
3 
```
*Explanation*: This test case evaluates the function with a single outcome, ensuring that the bet is less than the winnings. The given solution satisfies the condition.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
50
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case evaluates the function with a large number of outcomes, ensuring that the total bet cannot be less than the winnings for any outcome, leading to an invalid distribution.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: This test case evaluates the function with a single outcome and a high multiplier, ensuring that the bet is less than the winnings. The given solution satisfies the condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
2
2 2
3
2 3 2
4
2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
2 3 2 
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case evaluates the function with different numbers of outcomes and multipliers, ensuring that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. The given solutions satisfy the condition for the first two cases but not for the third case.
