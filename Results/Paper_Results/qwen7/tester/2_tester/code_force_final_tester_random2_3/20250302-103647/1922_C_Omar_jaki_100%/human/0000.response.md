**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality and queries provided in the problem statement.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 10
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are only two cities with a large gap between them. The closest city to each is the other one, and traveling directly to the target city incurs the full cost.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 10 20
3
1 3
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
10
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the situation where the closest city to each is exactly one step away. Each query involves traveling to the closest city, which costs 1 coin, and then to the target city, which costs the difference between their positions.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 5 10 15
4
1 4
2 3
3 1
4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
5
6
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the closest city to each is not the immediate neighbor but still follows the defined rule. Each query involves traveling to the closest city, which costs 1 coin, and then to the target city.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 5 10 15 20 25

```
**Output**: 
```
25

5
5
5
25
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario with more cities and ensures that traveling to the closest city and then to the target city works correctly even when the closest city is further away.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 2 4 6 8 10 12
7
1 7
2 6

7 1
```
**Output**: 
```
12
4
3
3
3
4
12
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario with an odd number of cities and ensures that the logic handles the closest city correctly even when it is not an immediate neighbor.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1000000000
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario with the maximum possible value for the city coordinates, ensuring the solution handles large numbers correctly.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
3
1 3
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case verifies the scenario where the cities are very close together, ensuring the logic handles small differences in coordinates correctly.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 10 20 30
4
1 4
2 3
3 2
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
20
10
10
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the cities are evenly spaced, ensuring the logic handles evenly distributed cities correctly.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 10 20 30 40
5
1 5
2 4
3 3
4 2
5 1
```
**Output**: 
```
30
10
0
10
30
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the closest city to some cities is itself, ensuring the logic handles self-closeness correctly.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
