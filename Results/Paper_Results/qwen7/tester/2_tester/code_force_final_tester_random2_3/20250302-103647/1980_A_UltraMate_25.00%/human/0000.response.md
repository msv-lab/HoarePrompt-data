# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when there are enough problems in the bank to cover all required rounds without needing any additional problems.

**Input**:
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
**Output**:
```
0
2
1
```

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 1 and the number of problems in the bank is also 1, but the difficulty level of the single problem does not match the requirement.

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
G
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 1 and the number of problems in the bank is 7, but the bank only has one type of problem.

**Input**:
```
1
7 1
AAAAAAA
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 1 and the number of problems in the bank is 1, but the difficulty level of the single problem matches the requirement.

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
A
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 2 and the number of problems in the bank is 10, but the bank only has one type of problem.

**Input**:
```
1
10 2
AAAAAAA
```
**Output**:
```
12
```

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 2 and the number of problems in the bank is 10, but the bank has a mix of problems that partially meet the requirement.

**Input**:
```
1
10 2
ABBBBBBBB
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 5 and the number of problems in the bank is 10, but the bank has a mix of problems that partially meet the requirement.

**Input**:
```
1
10 5
ABCDEFABC
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 5 and the number of problems in the bank is 5, but the bank has a mix of problems that partially meet the requirement.

**Input**:
```
1
5 5
ABCDF
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 5 and the number of problems in the bank is 1, but the bank has a mix of problems that partially meet the requirement.

**Input**:
```
1
1 5
A
```
**Output**:
```
4
```

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of required rounds is 5 and the number of problems in the bank is 1, but the bank has a mix of problems that fully meet the requirement.

**Input**:
```
1
1 5
ABCDE
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
