```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, which is not enough to form any polygon.

# Test 2

**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Two sticks of the same length are not enough to form a polygon.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```

1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sticks cannot form any polygon since no three sticks can satisfy the triangle inequality.

# Test 4

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Four sticks of length 3 can form a square, while the remaining two sticks of length 2 can form a rhombus (which is a type of polygon).

```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Six sticks of length 4 can form a hexagon, and the remaining three pairs of sticks of length 2 can form two squares.

```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
**Explanation**: In the first subcase, there is only one stick, so no polygon can be formed. In the second subcase, two equal-length sticks can form a rhombus.

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The sticks cannot form any polygon since no combination of three sticks can satisfy the triangle inequality.
