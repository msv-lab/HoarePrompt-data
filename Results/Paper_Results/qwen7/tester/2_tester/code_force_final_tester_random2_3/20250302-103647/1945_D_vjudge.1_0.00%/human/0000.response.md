# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 4 and wants to move to one of the first 2 positions. He can pay 7 coins to move from position 4 to position 3, and then 3 coins to move from position 3 to position 2. The total cost is 7 + 3 + 4 = 14 coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 6 and wants to move to one of the first 2 positions. He can pay 6 coins to move from position 6 to position 5, then 8 coins to move from position 5 to position 4, and finally 8 coins to move from position 4 to position 2. The total cost is 6 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 23 coins. However, moving from position 6 to position 3 and then to position 2 would cost 6 + 8 + 8 = 22 coins, which is less.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 7 and wants to move to position 7. No moves are needed, so the cost is 0. However, if we consider moving to other positions, the minimum cost would be to move directly to position 7 without any intermediate steps, making the cost 0. But since the problem asks for the minimum cost to get into the first m positions, moving to position 7 directly is the optimal solution.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 2 and wants to move to position 1. He can pay 1 coin to move from position 2 to position 1. The total cost is 3 coins.

# Test 5
**Input**:

3 3
1 2 3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
3
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, Kirill is already in the first position, so no moves are needed. In the second test case, Kirill starts at position 3 and wants to move to one of the first 3 positions. Moving from position 3 to position 2 costs 1 coin, and moving from position 2 to position 1 costs 1 coin, making the total cost 3 coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
5 10 15 20 25
```
**Output**: 
```
105
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 5 and wants to move to one of the first 3 positions. The optimal path is to move from position 5 to position 4, then to position 3, paying 20 + 30 + 50 = 100 coins. Additionally, moving from position 4 to position 2 and then to position 1 would cost more, so the total cost is 105 coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 3 and wants to move to position 1. The optimal path is to move from position 3 to position 2, then to position 1, paying 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
1 2 3 4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 4 and wants to move to one of the first 4 positions. The optimal path is to move from position 4 to position 3, then to position 2, and finally to position 1, paying 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 coins.

# Test 9
**Input**:

```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 5 and wants to move to position 5. No moves are needed, so the cost is 0. However, if we consider moving to other positions, the minimum cost would be to move directly to position 5 without any intermediate steps, making the cost 0. But since the problem asks for the minimum cost to get into the first m positions, moving to position 5 directly is the optimal solution.

# Test 10

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: Kirill starts at position 10 and wants to move to one of the first 5 positions. The optimal path is to move from position 10 to position 9, then to position 8, then to position 7, then to position 6, and finally to position 5, paying 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 coins.
