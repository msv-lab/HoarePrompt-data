# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element to 3, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median is now 3. This requires only 1 operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the last two elements to 2, the array becomes [7, 3, 3, 2], and the median is now 3. However, we can also increase the last element to 3, making the array [7, 3, 3, 3], and the median is now 3. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The array has only one element, so the median is the element itself. Increasing it by 1 will make the new median greater than the original one. This requires 1 operation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the last element to 6, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 4, 6], and the median is now 5. However, we can also increase the last three elements to 6, making the array [5, 5, 5, 6, 6], and the median is now 5. This requires 3 operations.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first and third elements to 3, the array becomes [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4], and the median is now 3. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1. By increasing the first element to 2, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is now 2. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing the first element to 2, the array becomes [2, 1], and the median is now 1. However, we can also increase the first and second elements to 2, making the array [2, 2], and the median is now 2. This requires 3 operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. Since all elements are already equal to the median, no operations are needed.
