# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: The only subsequence that sums to 2 is the entire sequence itself, which is not allowed. A sequence of length 1 with a single element 1 ensures no subsequence sums to 2, while every other number less than 2 has a subsequence summing to it.

**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
6 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 3 4 5 6
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 1, and subsequences of lengths 1 through 5 can sum to 2 through 6 respectively.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 8 \).
**Input**: 
```
8 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 8, and subsequences of lengths 1 through 7 can sum to 1 through 7 respectively.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 9 \) and \( k = 3 \).
**Input**: 
```
9 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 3, and subsequences of lengths 1 through 4 can sum to 1, 2, 4, and 7 respectively (1+1+1+1=4).

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 7 \).
**Input**: 
```
10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 8 3
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 7, and subsequences of lengths 1 through 4 can sum to 1, 2, 3, and 8 respectively (1+2+3+2=8).

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum value of \( n \) and \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: Since \( n = 1 \), the sequence must be of length 1. The only possible value is 1, ensuring no subsequence sums to 1000000 and that the subsequence of length 1 sums to 1.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum value of \( n \) and \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This is the same as Test 1, ensuring consistency with the smallest values.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) and \( k \) are consecutive integers.
**Input**: 
```
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 2
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 2, and subsequences of lengths 1 and 2 can sum to 1 and 2 respectively.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is a power of 2.
**Input**: 
```
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
1 2 4 8
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 4, and subsequences of lengths 1 through 4 can sum to 1, 2, 4, and 8 respectively.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is a prime number.
**Input**: 
```
7 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
1 2 4
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 3, and subsequences of lengths 1, 2, and 3 can sum to 1, 2, and 4 respectively (1+2+1=4).

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is a large even number.
**Input**: 
```
1000000 500000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: Since \( n \) is very large and \( k \) is half of \( n \), the sequence must be of length 1. The only possible value is 1, ensuring no subsequence sums to 500000 and that the subsequence of length 1 sums to 1.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is a large odd number.
**Input**: 
```
1000001 500000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: Since \( n \) is very large and \( k \) is half of \( n \), the sequence must be of length 1. The only possible value is 1, ensuring no subsequence sums to 500000 and that the subsequence of length 1 sums to 1.

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is slightly larger than \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
10 9
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1 9
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 9, and subsequences of lengths 1 and 2 can sum to 1 and 9 respectively.

# Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is slightly smaller than \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Explanation**: No subsequence sums to 3, and subsequences of lengths 1, 2, and 3 can sum to 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

# Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is much larger than \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: Since \( n \) is very large and \( k \) is 1, the sequence must be of length 1. The only possible value is 1, ensuring no subsequence sums to 1 and that the subsequence of length 1 sums to 1.

# Test 16
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where \( n \) is much smaller than \( k \).
**Input**: 
```
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: Since \( n \) is small and \( k \) is 1, the sequence must be of length 1. The only possible value is 1, ensuring no subsequence sums to 1 and that the subsequence of length 1 sums to 1.
