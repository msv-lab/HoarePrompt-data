# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 1 \). He will sell one bun for 5 coins and the remaining three buns for 4 coins each, resulting in a total profit of \( 5 + 4 \times 3 = 17 \) coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 5 \). He will sell all five buns for the modified prices, resulting in a total profit of \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \) coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 0 \). He will sell all ten buns for the usual price of 10 coins each, resulting in a total profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
45
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 5 \). He will sell all five buns for the modified prices, resulting in a total profit of \( 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45 \) coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 0 \). He will sell all ten buns for the usual price of 10 coins each, resulting in a total profit of \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) coins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 0 \). He will sell all one billion buns for the usual price of 1 billion coins each, resulting in a total profit of \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000000000
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 0 \). He will sell all one billion buns for the usual price of 1 billion coins each, resulting in a total profit of \( 1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000 \) coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 1 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
500500
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 0 \). He will sell all one thousand buns for the usual price of 1 coin each, resulting in a total profit of \( 1000 \times 1 = 1000 \) coins. However, since the problem asks for the sum of the series from 1 to 1000, the correct answer is \( \frac{1000 \times 1001}{2} = 500500 \) coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 1 \). He will sell one bun for 1 coin, resulting in a total profit of \( 1 \) coin.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 1 \). He will sell one bun for 2 coins, resulting in a total profit of \( 2 \) coins. Since the usual price is 1 coin, the profit is \( 2 - 1 = 1 \) coin.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 2 \). He will sell both buns for the modified prices, resulting in a total profit of \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) coins. However, since the usual price is 2 coins, the profit is \( 2 + 1 - 2 \times 2 = 3 - 4 = -1 \), but since profit cannot be negative, the maximum profit is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \) coins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 3 \). He will sell all three buns for the modified prices, resulting in a total profit of \( 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \) coins. However, since the usual price is 3 coins, the profit is \( 3 + 2 + 1 - 3 \times 3 = 6 - 9 = -3 \), but since profit cannot be negative, the maximum profit is \( 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 \) coins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Bob should choose \( k = 3 \). He will sell all three buns for the modified prices, resulting in a total profit of \( 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 \) coins.
