To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with an equal distribution of stones across all piles.
**Input**:
```
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 3 \) and empty all piles in one move, winning the game.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small difference in stone counts.
**Input**:
```
2
1 7
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \( k = 1 \), leaving Bob to choose \( k = 6 \) and win.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a mix of small and large piles.
**Input**:
```
7
1 3 9 7 4 2 100
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small number of piles.
**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a mix of small and large piles, ensuring the smallest pile is not the only one.
**Input**:
```
6
2 1 3 4 2 4
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large number of piles.
**Input**:
```
8
5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 2 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a single pile.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1000000000 \) and win immediately.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a single pile of size 1.
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with multiple piles where the smallest pile is 1.
**Input**:
```
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Alice must choose \( k = 1 \), leaving Bob to choose \( k = 1 \) and win.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with multiple piles where the smallest pile is 1 and others are larger.
**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function with multiple piles where the smallest pile is 1 and others are much larger.
**Input**:
```
4
1 10 100 1000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function with multiple piles where the smallest pile is 1 and others are very large.
**Input**:
```
5
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function with multiple piles where the smallest pile is 1 and others are equal.
**Input**:
```
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and empty all piles in one move, winning the game.

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the function with multiple piles where the smallest pile is 1 and others are close to each other.
**Input**:
```
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

#### Test 15
**Objective**: Verify the function with multiple piles where the smallest pile is 1 and others are very close to each other.
**Input**:
```
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can choose \( k = 1 \) and reduce the game to smaller piles, eventually winning.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles various edge cases and typical conditions effectively.
