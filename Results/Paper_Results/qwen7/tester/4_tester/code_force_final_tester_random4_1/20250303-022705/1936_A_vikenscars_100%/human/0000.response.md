Given the problem statement, we need to create comprehensive test cases for the interactive problem described. Here are the test cases, both basic and edge scenarios, that cover various conditions to ensure the solution's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Test 1: Basic Case with Small Permutation
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small permutation size.
**Input**:
```
2
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
! 3 2
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the basic functionality with a small permutation size. The expected output shows the queries and the final answer for finding the indices with the maximum XOR.

### Test 2: Basic Case with Medium Permutation
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a medium permutation size.
**Input**:
```
2
8
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
! 7 6
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the function with a larger permutation size but still within a manageable range. The expected output shows the queries and the final answer for finding the indices with the maximum XOR.

### Test 3: Basic Case with Large Permutation
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a large permutation size.
**Input**:
```
2
10000
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
! 9999 9998
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the function with a very large permutation size. The expected output shows the queries and the final answer for finding the indices with the maximum XOR.

### Test 4: Edge Case with Permutation Size 2
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the smallest possible permutation size.
**Input**:
```
2
2
```
**Output**:
```
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the function with the smallest possible permutation size. The expected output directly provides the indices since the maximum XOR is always 1.

### Test 5: Edge Case with Permutation Size 3
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a small permutation size.
**Input**:
```
2
3
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 0
=
! 2 0
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the function with a small permutation size. The expected output shows the queries and the final answer for finding the indices with the maximum XOR.

### Test 6: Edge Case with Permutation Size 4 and Specific Values
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a specific permutation size with known values.
**Input**:
```
2
4
0 3 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
! 3 2
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the function with a specific permutation size and known values. The expected output shows the queries and the final answer for finding the indices with the maximum XOR.

### Test 7: Edge Case with Permutation Size 5 and Specific Values
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a specific permutation size with known values.
**Input**:
```
2
5
0 4 1 3 2
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
! 4 2
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the function with a specific permutation size and known values. The expected output shows the queries and the final answer for finding the indices with the maximum XOR.

### Test 8: Edge Case with Permutation Size 10000 and Specific Values
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large permutation size with specific values.
**Input**:
```
2
10000
0 9999 1 9998 2 9997 3 9996 4 9995
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<
? 1 1 2 3
=
? 1 2 0 3
>
! 9999 9998
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**: This test checks the function with a large permutation size and specific values. The expected output shows the queries and the final answer for finding the indices with the maximum XOR.

These test cases cover a range of permutation sizes and specific values to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
