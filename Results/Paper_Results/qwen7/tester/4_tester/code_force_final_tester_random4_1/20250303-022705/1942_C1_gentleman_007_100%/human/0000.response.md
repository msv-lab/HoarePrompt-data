To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple polygon where the chosen vertices allow forming multiple triangles.

**Input**:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where all vertices can be used to form triangles.

**Input**:
```
3
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With all vertices, we can form 6 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small polygon where the chosen vertices allow forming only one triangle.

**Input**:
```
3
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1 and 3, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large polygon where the chosen vertices are few and far apart.

**Input**:
```
3
1000000000 2 0
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With only two vertices, we can form at most 1 non-intersecting triangular piece of cake.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are consecutive.

**Input**:
```
3
8 7 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With consecutive vertices, we can form at most 1 non-intersecting triangular piece of cake.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are all adjacent.

**Input**:
```
3
8 7 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With all adjacent vertices, we can form at most 1 non-intersecting triangular piece of cake.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are spread out but not enough to form multiple triangles.

**Input**:
```
3
8 5 0
1 3 5 7 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, and 2, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the chosen vertices are such that no triangle can be formed.

**Input**:
```
3
8 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With vertices 1, 2, and 3, no triangle can be formed.
