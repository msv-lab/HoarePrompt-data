To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple polygon with a small number of sides, where Bessie chooses a few vertices and there are enough remaining vertices to form triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a larger polygon where Bessie chooses a moderate number of vertices and there are enough remaining vertices to form triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where Bessie chooses a large number of vertices and there are just enough remaining vertices to form one additional triangle.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function when Bessie chooses all vertices except one, and there are no additional vertices available to form triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
5 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function when Bessie chooses all vertices except two, and there are exactly two additional vertices available to form triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
6 5 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function when Bessie chooses all vertices except one, and there are enough additional vertices to form multiple triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
6 5 1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function when Bessie chooses all vertices, and there are no additional vertices available to form triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
4 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function when Bessie chooses a very large number of vertices and there are no additional vertices available to form triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999999 0
1 2 3 ... 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function when Bessie chooses a very large number of vertices and there are just enough additional vertices to form one triangle.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999999 1
1 2 3 ... 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function when Bessie chooses a very large number of vertices and there are enough additional vertices to form multiple triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999998 2
1 2 3 ... 999999998
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
