# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality for \( n = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 1 \), the matrix is a single element which is initially 0. Performing a Type 1 operation on the single element sets it to 1, maximizing the sum.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where \( n = 100 \).
**Input**: 
```
1

```
**Output**: 
```
10000 200
1 1 1 2 3 ... 99 100

1 100 1 2 ... 99 98
2 1 1 2 3 ... 99 100
2 2 3 ... 100 1 2
2 3 4 ... 100 1 2
...
2 99 100 1 ... 98 97
2 100 1 2 ... 99 98
```
**Explanation**: For \( n = 100 \), the matrix is a 100x100 matrix with initial values of 0. We perform 200 operations to maximize the sum:
1. Set the first row to [1, 2, 3, ..., 100].
2. Set the second row to [1, 2, 3, ..., 100].
3. Continue setting each subsequent row to [1, 2, 3, ..., 100] until the 100th row.
4. Set the first column to [1, 1, 1, ..., 1].
5. Set the second column to [2, 2, 2, ..., 2].
6. Continue setting each subsequent column to [3, 3, 3, ..., 3] until the 100th column.

This ensures the maximum possible sum of the matrix is achieved within the allowed 2n operations.
