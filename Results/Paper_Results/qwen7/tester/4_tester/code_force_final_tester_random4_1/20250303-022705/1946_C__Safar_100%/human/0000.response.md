*Explanation*: For the first tree, after removing the edge 1-3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices and another with 3 vertices. The smallest component has 2 vertices, so the answer is 2. For the second tree, after removing the edge 1-2, the tree splits into two components: one with 1 vertex and another with 5 vertices. The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.
