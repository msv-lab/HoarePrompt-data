# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: In this basic test case, the numbers are 1, 4, 3, and 4. Their binary representations are `00000000000000000000000000000001`, `00000000000000000000000000001000`, `00000000000000000000000000000011`, and `00000000000000000000000000001000`. Since any two numbers share at least one matching bit, each number must be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are 0 and \(2^{31}-1\), which are `00000000000000000000000000000000` and `11111111111111111111111111111111` respectively. They do not share any bits, so they can be in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are quite large, but their binary representations will still have some bits that match. By carefully examining their binary forms, we can determine that they can be divided into three groups.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different sets of bits that match, allowing them to be divided into two groups.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Similar to Test 4, these numbers can be divided into two groups based on their differing bits.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers can be divided into three groups due to the specific pattern of their bits.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two zeros and two maximum values can be divided into two groups.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two zeros and one maximum value can be divided into two groups.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case involves repeated numbers, which complicates the grouping process. The numbers can be divided into four groups.
