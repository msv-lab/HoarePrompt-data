# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Coloring 2 cells can also satisfy the condition of having at least 3 diagonals with a colored cell.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: In a 3x3 grid, we need to color all 6 cells to ensure that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: We need to color 5 cells to ensure that at least 9 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: For a 4x4 grid, we can color 4 cells to ensure that at least 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: In a 7x7 grid, we need to color 6 cells to ensure that at least 11 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: For a 2x2 grid, we need to color 2 cells to ensure that at least 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: In both cases, we need to color 2 cells to meet the diagonal requirements.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
3 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: For a 3x3 grid, we need to color 2 cells to meet the diagonal requirements for both cases.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
4 5
4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
3
```
*Explanation*: For a 4x4 grid, we need to color 3 cells to meet the diagonal requirements for both cases.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
5 8
5 9
```
**Output**: 
```
4
4
```
*Explanation*: For a 5x5 grid, we need to color 4 cells to meet the diagonal requirements for both cases.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
10 20
10 21
```
**Output**: 
```
8
8
```
*Explanation*: For a 10x10 grid, we need to color 8 cells to meet the diagonal requirements for both cases.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
100 400
100 401
```
**Output**: 
```
8
8
```
*Explanation*: For a 100x100 grid, we need to color 8 cells to meet the diagonal requirements for both cases.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
*Explanation*: For a very large grid, the solution remains consistent with the pattern observed in smaller grids.
