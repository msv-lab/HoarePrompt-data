# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic case where the matrix is a 1x1 matrix. The maximum sum is 1, and we achieve this by setting \(a_{1,1} = 1\) using one operation of type 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic case where the matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The maximum sum is 7, and we achieve this by performing three operations: two of type 1 and one of type 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
18 6
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 2 3 1
1 3 3 1 2
2 1 1 2 3
2 2 2 3 1
2 3 3 1 2
```
*Explanation*: This is a more complex case where the matrix is a 3x3 matrix. The maximum sum is 18, and we achieve this by performing six operations: three of type 1 and three of type 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2
1

```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1

7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
*Explanation*: This test case checks the function with multiple test cases. The first sub-case is a 1x1 matrix, and the second sub-case is a 2x2 matrix. The outputs are as described in Test 1 and Test 2.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1

2 3 3 4 5 1 2
2 4 4 5 1 2 3
2 5 5 1 2 3 4
```
*Explanation*: This is a more extensive case where the matrix is a 5x5 matrix. The maximum sum is 50, and we achieve this by performing ten operations: five of type 1 and five of type 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1

```
**Output**: 
```
32 8
1 1 1 2 3 4

1 3 3 4 1 2
1 4 4 1 2 3
2 1 1 2 3 4
2 2 2 3 4 1
2 3 3 4 1 2
2 4 4 1 2 3
```
*Explanation*: This is a case where the matrix is a 4x4 matrix. The maximum sum is 32, and we achieve this by performing eight operations: four of type 1 and four of type 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
18 6
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 2 3 1
1 3 3 1 2
2 1 1 2 3
2 2 2 3 1
2 3 3 1 2
```
*Explanation*: This is a repeated case to ensure consistency and correctness for a 3x3 matrix.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
*Explanation*: This is a repeated case to ensure consistency and correctness for a 2x2 matrix.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1 1
```
*Explanation*: This is a repeated case to ensure consistency and correctness for a 1x1 matrix.

# Test 10

```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
*Explanation*: This is a repeated case to ensure consistency and correctness for a 2x2 matrix.

# Test 11
