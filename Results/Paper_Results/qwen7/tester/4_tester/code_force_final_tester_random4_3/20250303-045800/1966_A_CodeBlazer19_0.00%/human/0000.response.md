# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: We can exchange three cards with value 4 to get two cards with value 1, resulting in a total of 2 cards left.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Since we only have one card, no operations can be performed, and the result remains 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: We can exchange all cards with the same value to reduce the count. For instance, we can exchange four cards with value 2 to get two cards, then exchange those two cards to get one card, leaving us with one card.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: We can exchange four cards at a time. After exchanging four cards, we will be left with 2 cards, and another exchange will leave us with 1 card. However, since we can only exchange in groups of 4, we will be left with 2 cards after the first exchange and 1 card after the second, totaling 3 cards.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2
3 8 1 48 7
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Each group of 2 cards cannot be further reduced, so the minimum number of cards left is 5.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: We can exchange pairs of cards with the same value to reduce the count. After exchanging, we will be left with one card.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: We can exchange groups of 3 cards at a time. Since we cannot further reduce the count, the minimum number of cards left is 6.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
3 2
1 2 3
4 3
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
4
```
*Explanation*: In the first case, we cannot perform any exchanges, so the minimum number of cards is 3. In the second case, we can exchange all four cards in groups of 3 to leave us with 1 card, but since we can only exchange in groups of 3, the minimum number of cards is 4.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: We can exchange five cards at a time. After the first exchange, we will be left with 2 cards, and no further exchanges are possible, so the minimum number of cards is 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100 2
1 1 1 ... 1 (100 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: We cannot perform any exchanges since no two cards have the same value, so the minimum number of cards is 100.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
1 1 1 ... 1 (100 ones)
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: We can exchange all 100 cards in one go, leaving us with 1 card.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: With only one card, no operations can be performed, so the result is 1.
