To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Test 1: Basic Case with Small Values
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with small values.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3. Adding one more vertex (either 2 or 4) will allow forming exactly one triangle.

### Test 2: Basic Case with Larger Values
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with larger values.
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5. By adding up to 2 more vertices, we can form 6 triangles as shown in the example.

### Test 3: Maximum Triangles with Constraints
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of triangles possible within constraints.
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 3
1 3 5 7 9
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Explanation**: With 10 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. By adding up to 3 more vertices, we can form 10 triangles.

### Test 4: Minimum Triangles with Constraints
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of triangles possible.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3. No additional vertices can be added, so only one triangle can be formed.

### Test 5: Degenerate Case with Fewer Chosen Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases where fewer vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
6 3 1
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 3, and 5. By adding one more vertex, we can form 3 triangles.

### Test 6: Degenerate Case with Maximum Chosen Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases where the maximum number of vertices are chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
6 5 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. No additional vertices can be added, so only one triangle can be formed.

### Test 7: Degenerate Case with Zero Additional Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases where zero additional vertices can be chosen.
**Input**:
```
1
6 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3. No additional vertices can be added, so only one triangle can be formed.

### Test 8: Degenerate Case with Maximum Sides and Minimum Chosen Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases with the maximum number of sides and minimum chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 2. No additional vertices can be added, so only one triangle can be formed.

### Test 9: Degenerate Case with Maximum Sides and Maximum Chosen Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases with the maximum number of sides and maximum chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999998 1
1 2 3 ... 999999998
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, Bessie has chosen 999,999,998 vertices. Only one additional vertex can be added, so only one triangle can be formed.

### Test 10: Degenerate Case with Maximum Sides and Minimum Additional Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases with the maximum number of sides and minimum additional vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 2. One additional vertex can be added, allowing for 3 triangles to be formed.

### Test 11: Degenerate Case with Maximum Sides and Maximum Additional Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles cases with the maximum number of sides and maximum additional vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 999999997
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
999999997
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 2. The maximum number of additional vertices can be added, allowing for 999,999,997 triangles to be formed.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
