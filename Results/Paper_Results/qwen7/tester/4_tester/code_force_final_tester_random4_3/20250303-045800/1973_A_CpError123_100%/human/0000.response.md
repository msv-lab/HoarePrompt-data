To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where no games were played.
**Input**:
```
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: No games were played, so no draws could occur.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where one game was played and ended in a draw.
**Input**:
```
0 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One game between the second and third player resulted in a draw, giving both 1 point.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the scores are equal and can be achieved through draws.
**Input**:
```
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games and results. This is an invalid scenario as per the problem constraints.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the scores are such that they can be achieved through two draws.
**Input**:
```
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two games can be played: one between the first and second player resulting in a draw (1-1), and another between the second and third player resulting in a win for the third player (2-0).

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the scores are such that they cannot be achieved through any valid set of games and results.
**Input**:
```
3 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games and results.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the highest score is achieved through wins.
**Input**:
```
0 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: The scores cannot be achieved through a valid set of games and results. The highest score (3) cannot be achieved without a win, but the middle score (2) requires a win, which is impossible without affecting the highest score.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the scores are at the upper limit and can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.
**Input**:
```
3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws. For example, the first player can win against the second player twice (4 points), and then lose to the third player once (3 points).

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the scores are at the lower limit and can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.
**Input**:
```
1 1 10
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws. For example, the first player can win against the second player once (2 points), and then lose to the third player eight times (1 point), and the second player can win against the third player once (2 points), and then lose to the first player six times (1 point).
