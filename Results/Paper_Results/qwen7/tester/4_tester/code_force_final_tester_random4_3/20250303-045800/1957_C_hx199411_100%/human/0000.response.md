To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Small Board with Few Moves
**Input**:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: After placing a white rook at (1, 2) and a black rook at (2, 1), there are three possible configurations for the remaining positions.

#### Test Case 2: Medium Board with Few Moves
**Input**:
```
1
8 1
7 6
```
**Output**:
```
331
```
**Explanation**: After placing a white rook at (7, 6) and a black rook at (6, 7), there are 331 possible configurations for the remaining positions.

#### Test Case 3: Large Board with Few Moves
**Input**:
```
1
1000 4
4 4
952 343
222 333
90 91
```
**Output**:
```
671968183
```
**Explanation**: After placing rooks at the specified positions, there are 671,968,183 possible configurations for the remaining positions.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 4: Small Board with Maximum Moves
**Input**:
```
1
4 4
1 2
2 1
3 4
4 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: After placing rooks at all possible positions, only one configuration remains where no more rooks can be placed.

#### Test Case 5: Medium Board with Maximum Moves
**Input**:
```
1
8 8
1 2
2 1
3 4
4 3
5 6
6 5
7 8
8 7
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: After placing rooks at all possible positions, only one configuration remains where no more rooks can be placed.

#### Test Case 6: Large Board with No Moves
**Input**:
```
1
1000 0
```
**Output**:
```
1048576
```
**Explanation**: With no moves made, there are \(2^{(1000 \times 1000 - 1000)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) possible configurations, which simplifies to \(2^{999000} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Test Case 7: Large Board with Maximum Possible Moves
**Input**:
```
1
1000 500
```
**Output**:
```
1048576
```
**Explanation**: After placing rooks at half the positions, the remaining positions still allow for \(2^{(1000 \times 1000 - 1000 \times 2)} \mod (10^9 + 7)\) possible configurations, which simplifies to \(2^{998000} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
