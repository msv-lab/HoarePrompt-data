# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: In the initial sequence, there is one '1', one '2', and one '3'. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(1 \oplus 2 \oplice 3 = 0\), which means Bob wins. If Eve removes any number, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, meaning Alice wins. Therefore, Bob can win once if Eve removes the optimal number.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has one '1', one '3', and two '4's. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 = 0\), which means Bob wins. If Eve removes one '1' and one '3', the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, meaning Alice wins. Therefore, Bob can win once if Eve removes the optimal numbers.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has two '1's, two '2's, and two '3's. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(1 \oplus 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 = 0\), which means Bob wins. Eve can remove one '1', one '2', and one '3' to leave a sequence with a non-zero XOR. Therefore, Bob can win three times if Eve removes the optimal numbers.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has three '1's, three '2's, and two '3's. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(1 \oplus 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 = 0\), which means Bob wins. Eve can remove one '1', one '2', and one '3' to leave a sequence with a non-zero XOR. Therefore, Bob can win three times if Eve removes the optimal numbers.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has nine '2's, nine '3's, and nine '4's. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 \oplus 4 = 0\), which means Bob wins. Eve can remove all '2's, '3's, and '4's in pairs to leave a sequence with a non-zero XOR. Therefore, Bob can win twelve times if Eve removes the optimal numbers.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence is empty, so the bitwise XOR is zero, meaning Bob wins. Since no numbers are present, Bob wins every time. Therefore, Bob can win zero times if Eve removes the optimal numbers.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has one '1', one '2', one '3', and one '4'. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\), which means Bob wins. If Eve removes any number, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, meaning Alice wins. Therefore, Bob can win once if Eve removes the optimal number.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has two '1's. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\), which means Bob wins. Since no other numbers are present, Eve cannot remove any number to change the outcome. Therefore, Bob wins every time, and the number of times Bob can win is zero.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has one '2', one '3', and one '4'. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0\), which means Bob wins. If Eve removes any number, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, meaning Alice wins. Therefore, Bob can win once if Eve removes the optimal number.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The initial sequence has two '1's and two '2's. The bitwise XOR of these numbers is \(1 \oplus 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 2 = 0\), which means Bob wins. Eve can remove one '1' and one '2' to leave a sequence with a non-zero XOR. Therefore, Bob can win twice if Eve removes the optimal numbers.
