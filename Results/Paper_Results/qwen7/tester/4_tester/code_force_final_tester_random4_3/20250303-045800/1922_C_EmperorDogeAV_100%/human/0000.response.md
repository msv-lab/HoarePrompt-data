```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem statement. It includes a typical example with multiple queries and verifies the minimum cost for travel between different pairs of cities.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1000000000
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where there are only two cities with a large gap between their coordinates. The closest city for each city is the other city, and traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 10 20
3
1 3
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the cities are evenly spaced. The closest city for each city is the middle city, and traveling to the closest city costs 2 coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 5 10 15
4
1 4
2 3
3 2
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
2
2
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates a scenario where the cities are not evenly spaced but still follow the unique closest city rule. Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, and direct travel between non-closest cities costs more.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a scenario with more cities and various query pairs. It ensures that the solution handles larger sets of data and multiple queries efficiently.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
2
1 2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the simplest possible scenario with just two cities. Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin in both directions.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
3
1 3
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a scenario where the cities are sequentially ordered and the closest city for each city is the next or previous city. Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, and the minimum cost for each query is 2 coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 20 30
3
1 3
2 1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
10
10
10
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates a scenario where the cities are evenly spaced and far apart. Traveling directly between non-closest cities costs the maximum distance between them.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 3 5 7
4
1 4
2 3
3 2
4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
2
2
3
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks a scenario where the cities are evenly spaced and the closest city for each city is the next or previous city. Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin, and the minimum cost for each query is as specified.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000001
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the cities are very close to each other but still distinct. Traveling to the closest city costs 1 coin.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality, edge cases, and extreme conditions, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the solution.
