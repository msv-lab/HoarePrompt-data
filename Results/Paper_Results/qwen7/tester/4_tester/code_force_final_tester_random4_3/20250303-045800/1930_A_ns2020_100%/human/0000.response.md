To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple case where all elements are equal.
**Input**:
```
3
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Since all elements are the same, the minimum of any pair is always 1, and since there is only one pair, the score is 1.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the elements are in ascending order.
**Input**:
```
3
2
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal strategy is to pair the smallest elements first. Pairing (1, 2) and (3, 4) gives a score of 1 + 3 = 4 / 2 = 3.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the elements are in descending order.
**Input**:
```
3
2
4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Similar to the previous case, pairing (1, 2) and (3, 4) gives a score of 1 + 3 = 4 / 2 = 3.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the elements are in a mixed order.
**Input**:
```
3
2
2 1 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Pairing (1, 2) and (3, 4) gives a score of 1 + 3 = 4 / 2 = 3.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the number of elements is even and all elements are unique.
**Input**:
```
3
2
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Pairing (1, 2), (3, 4), and (5, 6) gives a score of (1 + 2) + (3 + 4) + (5 + 6) / 2 = 3 + 7 + 11 / 2 = 9.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the number of elements is odd.
**Input**:
```
3
1
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Since the number of elements is odd, the last element will not be used. Pairing (1, 2) gives a score of 1.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where all elements are the same except for one.
**Input**:
```
3
2
1 1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Pairing (1, 1) and (1, 2) gives a score of 1 + 1 = 2.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the elements are very large.
**Input**:
```
3
2
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
10000000
```
**Explanation**: Pairing (10000000, 10000000) and (10000000, 10000000) gives a score of (10000000 + 10000000) / 2 = 10000000.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the elements are sorted in reverse order and include duplicates.
**Input**:
```
3
2
10 9 8 7 6 5
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Explanation**: Pairing (5, 6), (7, 8), and (9, 10) gives a score of (5 + 6) + (7 + 8) + (9 + 10) / 2 = 11 + 15 + 19 / 2 = 15.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the elements are all the same.
**Input**:
```
3
2
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Pairing (1, 1) and (1, 1) gives a score of (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) / 2 = 2.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
