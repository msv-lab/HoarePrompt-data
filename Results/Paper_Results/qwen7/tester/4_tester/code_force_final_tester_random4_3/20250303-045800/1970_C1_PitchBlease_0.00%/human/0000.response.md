# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree is a simple line with two leaves at the ends.

**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a simple line with nodes 1, 2, and 3, where nodes 1 and 3 are leaves. Ron starts with the stone on node 3. Since node 2 is the only neighbor of node 3, Ron can move the stone to node 2, making it active. Hermione then has no valid move, so Ron wins.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree is a simple line with two leaves but different starting positions.

**Input**: 
```
3 1
2 3
3 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is the same as in Test 1, but Ron starts with the stone on node 1. Hermione can move the stone to node 2, making it active. Ron then has no valid move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree is a simple star with two leaves.

**Input**: 
```
4 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a star with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4, where nodes 2, 3, and 4 are connected to node 1. Node 4 is the only leaf. Ron starts with the stone on node 4. He can move the stone to node 1, making it active. Hermione then moves the stone to node 2 or 3, making it active. Ron then has no valid move, so Hermione wins. However, since Ron starts, he can move the stone back to node 4, making it active again. Hermione then has no valid move, so Ron wins.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree is a simple star with two leaves but different starting positions.

**Input**: 
```
4 1

```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Explanation**: The tree is the same as in Test 3, but Ron starts with the stone on node 1. Hermione can move the stone to node 2, 3, or 4, making them active. Ron then has no valid move, so Hermione wins.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality when the tree is a simple star with two leaves but different starting positions and a different structure.

**Input**: 
```
5 1

```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree is a star with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, where nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5 are connected to node 1. Node 5 is the only leaf. Ron starts with the stone on node 5. He can move the stone to node 1, making it active. Hermione then moves the stone to node 2, 3, or 4, making them active. Ron then has no valid move, so Hermione wins. However, since Ron starts, he can move the stone back to node 5, making it active again. Hermione then has no valid move, so Ron wins.

# Test 6
