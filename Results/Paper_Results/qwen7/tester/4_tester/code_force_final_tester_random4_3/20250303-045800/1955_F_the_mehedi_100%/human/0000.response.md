To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Case with Equal Distribution
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a balanced distribution of numbers.

**Input**:
```
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is one '1', one '2', and one '3'. If Eve removes any one of these, the remaining sequence will have a non-zero XOR, ensuring Alice wins. Therefore, Bob can win once.

#### Test 2: Simple Case with More Twos and Threes
**Input**:
```
1 0 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is one '1', two '3's, and no '2's. Removing one '3' leaves a sequence where the XOR is non-zero, ensuring Alice wins. Therefore, Bob can win once.

#### Test 3: Simple Case with More Ones and Fours
**Input**:
```
2 2 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are two '1's, two '2's, and two '3's. Removing any two numbers ensures the remaining sequence has a non-zero XOR, allowing Alice to win. Therefore, Bob can win three times.

#### Test 4: Simple Case with More Twos and Threes but One Four
**Input**:
```
3 3 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are three '1's, three '2's, two '3's, and no '4's. Removing any three numbers ensures the remaining sequence has a non-zero XOR, allowing Alice to win. Therefore, Bob can win three times.

#### Test 5: Simple Case with Only Ones and Fours
**Input**:
```
0 9 9 9
```
**Output**:
```
12
```
**Explanation**: There are nine '1's, nine '2's, nine '3's, and nine '4's. Removing any nine numbers ensures the remaining sequence has a non-zero XOR, allowing Alice to win. Therefore, Bob can win twelve times.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6: All Zeros
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence with all zeros.

**Input**:
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no '1's, '2's, '3's, or '4's. The XOR of an empty sequence is zero, ensuring Bob wins. Therefore, Bob wins zero times.

#### Test 7: Single Number
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence with a single number.

**Input**:
```
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is one '1'. The XOR of a single number is the number itself, which is non-zero, ensuring Alice wins. Therefore, Bob wins zero times.

#### Test 8: Maximum Possible Numbers
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum possible input values.

**Input**:
```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**:
```
600
```
**Explanation**: There are 200 '1's, 200 '2's, 200 '3's, and 200 '4's. Removing any 200 numbers ensures the remaining sequence has a non-zero XOR, allowing Alice to win. Therefore, Bob can win 600 times.

#### Test 9: Minimum Possible Numbers
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum possible input values.

**Input**:
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no numbers. The XOR of an empty sequence is zero, ensuring Bob wins. Therefore, Bob wins zero times.

#### Test 10: Single Non-Zero Number
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence with a single non-zero number.

**Input**:
```
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is one '1'. The XOR of a single number is the number itself, which is non-zero, ensuring Alice wins. Therefore, Bob wins zero times.
