     1
     6 5 2 2 5 3
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

2. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Bob starts directly above Alice.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     4 1 2 1 4 1
     ```

     ```
     Bob
     ```

3. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start far apart and there is no immediate threat.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     1 4 1 3 1 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```

     ```
     1
     5 5 1 4 5 2
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 1 6 10 8
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Alice
     ```

7. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Bob is in the first row and Alice is in the last row.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 10 6 1 8
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Bob
     ```

8. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close but not adjacent.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 9 1 8 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Draw
     ```

9. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close but not adjacent.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     10 10 8 1 10 2
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     Bob
     ```

10. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close but not adjacent.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      1
      10 10 1 1 2 1
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
      Alice
      ```

11. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close but not adjacent.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      1
      10 10 1 3 4 1
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
      Alice
      ```

12. **Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close but not adjacent.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      1
      10 10 3 1 1 1
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
      Alice
      ```

### Full Test Case Implementation

```python
def game_outcome(h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb):
    # Check if Alice can win immediately
    if xa < h and (ya == yb or (ya > 1 and (xa + 1, ya - 1) == (xb, yb)) or (ya < w and (xa + 1, ya + 1) == (xb, yb))):
        return "Alice"
    
    # Check if Bob can win immediately
    if xb > 1 and (yb == ya or (yb > 1 and (xb - 1, yb - 1) == (xa, ya)) or (yb < w and (xb - 1, yb + 1) == (xa, ya))):
        return "Bob"
    
    # Check if Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row
    if xa == h and xb == 1:
        return "Alice"
    
    # Check if Bob is in the first row and Alice is in the last row
    if xb == 1 and xa == h:
        return "Bob"
    
    # If neither can win immediately, the game is a draw
    return "Draw"
