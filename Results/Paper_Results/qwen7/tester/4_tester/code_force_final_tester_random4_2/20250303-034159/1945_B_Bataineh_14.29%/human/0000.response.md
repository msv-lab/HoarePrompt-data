# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
6 7 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and the second every 7 minutes. After 7 minutes, one firework from each installation is visible, making a total of 2 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4 10
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 3 minutes, and the second every 4 minutes. After 12 minutes, the pattern repeats such that up to 7 fireworks can be visible simultaneously.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
7 8 56
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 7 minutes, and the second every 8 minutes. After 56 minutes, the pattern repeats such that up to 17 fireworks can be visible simultaneously.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 6 78123459896
```
**Output**: 
```
28645268630
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 5 minutes, and the second every 6 minutes. After 78123459896 minutes, the pattern repeats such that up to 28645268630 fireworks can be visible simultaneously.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: Both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes. After 1 minute, there are 2 fireworks from each installation visible, making a total of 4 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000002
```
*Explanation*: Both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 1000000000000000001 minutes. After 1000000000000000000 minutes, there are 2 fireworks from each installation visible, making a total of 2000000000000000002 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 15 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 10 minutes, and the second every 15 minutes. After 30 minutes, the pattern repeats such that up to 5 fireworks can be visible simultaneously.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000001 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The first installation launches fireworks every 1000000000000000000 minutes, and the second every 1000000000000000001 minutes. Since the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is very large, only one firework from each installation can be visible at any given time, making a total of 2 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Both installations have the same frequency of launching fireworks, and each firework is visible for 1 minute. Since the LCM of their frequencies is the same, only one firework from each installation can be visible at any given time, making a total of 2 fireworks visible simultaneously.

# Test 10
