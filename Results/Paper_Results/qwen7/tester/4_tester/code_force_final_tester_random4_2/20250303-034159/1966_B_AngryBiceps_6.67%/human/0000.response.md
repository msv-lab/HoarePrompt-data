To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s how we can structure our test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: All Squares Already Same Color
**Objective**: Verify that if all squares are already the same color, the output is "YES".

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
WWW
WWW
WWW
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 2: Single Square Grid
**Objective**: Verify that a single square grid is considered to have all squares the same color.

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
W
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 3: Small Grid with All Operations Possible
**Objective**: Verify that a small grid can be made uniform through operations.

**Input**:
```
1
2 2
BB
BB
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 4: Grid with Initial Uniformity
**Objective**: Verify that a grid that starts with uniformity remains uniform.

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
WWW
BBB
WWW
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 5: Grid with Initial Non-Uniformity but Possible to Make Uniform
**Objective**: Verify that a non-uniform grid can be made uniform through operations.

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
BWW
BWB
BWW
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6: All Squares Different Colors
**Objective**: Verify that if all squares are different colors, the output is "NO".

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
WBB
BWW
BBW
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 7: Grid with Only One Square of Each Color
**Objective**: Verify that a grid with only one square of each color results in "NO".

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
WBB
BWW
BBW
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 8: Large Grid with Initial Uniformity
**Objective**: Verify that a large grid starting with uniformity remains uniform.

**Input**:
```
1
5 5
WWWWW
WWWWW
WWWWW
WWWWW
WWWWW
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 9: Large Grid with Initial Non-Uniformity but Impossible to Make Uniform
**Objective**: Verify that a large grid with non-uniformity that cannot be made uniform results in "NO".

**Input**:
```
1
5 5
WBBWW
BWWBW
WWBWW
BWWBW
WBBWW
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 10: Grid with Rows of Different Colors
**Objective**: Verify that a grid where each row has a different color pattern results in "NO".

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
WBB
BWW
BBW
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 11: Grid with Columns of Different Colors
**Objective**: Verify that a grid where each column has a different color pattern results in "NO".

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
WBB
BWW
BBW
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

#### Test 12: Grid with Alternating Rows and Columns
**Objective**: Verify that a grid with alternating rows and columns results in "NO".

**Input**:
```
1
3 3
WBB
BWW
BBW
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
