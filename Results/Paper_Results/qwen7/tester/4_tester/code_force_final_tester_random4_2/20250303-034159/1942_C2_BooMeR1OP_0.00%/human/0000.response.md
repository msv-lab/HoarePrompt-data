To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Test Case 1: Basic Scenario
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a typical input where the polygon has enough vertices to form multiple triangles.

**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 vertices, 4 of which are chosen by Bessie, and 2 additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 6.

### Test Case 2: Basic Scenario with Fewer Additional Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where fewer additional vertices can be chosen.

**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: With 7 vertices, 3 of which are chosen by Bessie, and only 1 additional vertex can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 5.

### Test Case 3: Basic Scenario with Maximum Additional Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the maximum number of additional vertices can be chosen.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 4 vertices, 2 of which are chosen by Bessie, and 2 additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

### Test Case 4: Edge Scenario with Minimum Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of vertices required to form at least one triangle.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 vertices, 2 of which are chosen by Bessie, and 1 additional vertex can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

### Test Case 5: Edge Scenario with Maximum Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of vertices in the polygon.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 999999998
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
999999997
```
**Explanation**: With \(10^9\) vertices, 2 of which are chosen by Bessie, and \(9.999999998 \times 10^8\) additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is \(9.999999997 \times 10^8\).

### Test Case 6: Edge Scenario with No Additional Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where no additional vertices can be chosen.

**Input**:
```
1
5 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 5 vertices, 2 of which are chosen by Bessie, and no additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

### Test Case 7: Edge Scenario with Only One Chosen Vertex
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where only one vertex is chosen by Bessie.

**Input**:
```
1
6 1 2
1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 6 vertices, 1 of which is chosen by Bessie, and 2 additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 3.

### Test Case 8: Edge Scenario with All Vertices Chosen by Bessie
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where all vertices are chosen by Bessie.

**Input**:
```
1
6 6 0
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With 6 vertices, all of which are chosen by Bessie, and no additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 0.

### Test Case 9: Edge Scenario with Maximum Number of Chosen Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the maximum number of vertices can be chosen by Bessie.

**Input**:
```
1
10 8 2
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 10 vertices, 8 of which are chosen by Bessie, and 2 additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

### Test Case 10: Edge Scenario with Minimum Number of Chosen Vertices
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a scenario where the minimum number of vertices can be chosen by Bessie.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 4 vertices, 2 of which are chosen by Bessie, and 2 additional vertices can be chosen by you, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust, reliable, and scalable.
