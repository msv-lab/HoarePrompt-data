To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here's a detailed set of test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: All Numbers are Fours
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence where all numbers are fours.

**Input**:
```
1 0 0 4
```
**Output**:
```
12
```
**Explanation**: Since all numbers are fours, the XOR of the sequence will be zero, and Bob will win every time. With 4 fours, there are 12 ways to remove numbers such that the XOR remains zero.

#### Test 2: Mixed Sequence with Equal Ones and Twos
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a mixed sequence with equal numbers of ones and twos.

**Input**:
```
2 2 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 2 ones and 2 twos, the optimal strategy for Eve is to remove one one and one two, resulting in a sequence where the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.

#### Test 3: Sequence with More Ones than Twos
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence with more ones than twos.

**Input**:
```
3 1 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 3 ones and 1 two, the optimal strategy for Eve is to remove one one and one two, resulting in a sequence where the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.

#### Test 4: Sequence with More Twos than Ones
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence with more twos than ones.

**Input**:
```
1 3 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 1 one and 3 twos, the optimal strategy for Eve is to remove one one and one two, resulting in a sequence where the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.

#### Test 5: Sequence with Equal Ones, Twos, and Threes
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence with equal numbers of ones, twos, and threes.

**Input**:
```
1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1 one, 1 two, and 1 three, the optimal strategy for Eve is to remove one one and one two, leaving one three, resulting in a sequence where the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6: All Numbers are Zeros
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence where all numbers are zeros.

**Input**:
```
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With all zeros, the XOR of the sequence is zero, and Bob wins every time. There are no ways to remove numbers such that the XOR remains non-zero.

#### Test 7: Single Number in the Sequence
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a sequence with a single number.

**Input**:
```
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With a single one, the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, and Alice wins. Eve cannot change this outcome by removing the single number.

#### Test 8: Maximum Possible Input
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum possible input values.

**Input**:
```
200 200 200 200
```
**Output**:
```
600
```
**Explanation**: With 200 ones, 200 twos, 200 threes, and 200 fours, the optimal strategy for Eve is to remove pairs of numbers such that the XOR remains zero, resulting in Bob winning 600 times.

#### Test 9: Minimum Possible Input
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum possible input values.

**Input**:
```
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: With a single four, the XOR of the sequence is non-zero, and Alice wins. Eve cannot change this outcome by removing the single number.
