# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
1
0
```
**Explanation**: This test case directly corresponds to the example provided in the problem statement. It tests the basic functionality of the game logic and the MEX calculation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This is a very small input where Alice can only pick the single element, resulting in a MEX of 1 since 0 is present in the final array.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 0 and Bob will pick 1, resulting in c = [0, 1], which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 0, Bob will pick 1, and Alice will pick 2, resulting in c = [0, 2], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 0, Bob will pick 1, Alice will pick 2, Bob will pick 3, and Alice will pick 4, resulting in c = [0, 2, 4], which has a MEX of 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 0, Bob will pick 1, Alice will pick 2, Bob will pick 3, Alice will pick 4, and Bob will pick 5, resulting in c = [0, 2, 4], which has a MEX of 1. However, due to the optimal play, the final MEX is 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 0, Bob will pick 1, Alice will pick 2, Bob will pick 3, Alice will pick 4, Bob will pick 5, Alice will pick 6, Bob will pick 7, Alice will pick 8, and Bob will pick 9, resulting in c = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8], which has a MEX of 5.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice cannot make any moves, so the MEX of an empty array is 0.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 1, resulting in c = [1], which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 1, Bob will pick 1, and Alice will pick 1 again, resulting in c = [1], which has a MEX of 0.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 2 3 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice will pick 1, Bob will pick 2, Alice will pick 3, and Bob will pick 0, resulting in c = [1, 3], which has a MEX of 0. However, due to optimal play, the final MEX is 1.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios from simple to complex, ensuring the solution handles various edge cases and typical conditions.
