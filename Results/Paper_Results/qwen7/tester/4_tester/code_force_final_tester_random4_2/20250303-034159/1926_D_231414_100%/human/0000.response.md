# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the numbers are 1, 4, 3, and 4. Their binary representations are `00000000000000000000000000000001`, `00000000000000000000000000001000`, `00000000000000000000000000000011`, and `00000000000000000000000000001000`. Since any two numbers share at least one matching bit, each number must be placed in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `0` and `2147483647`. The binary representation of `0` is `00000000000000000000000000000000` and the binary representation of `2147483647` is `11111111111111111111111111111111`. Since no two bits match, they can be placed in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `476319172`, `261956880`, `2136179468`, `1671164475`, and `1885526767`. By checking their binary representations, it can be seen that they cannot all be grouped together because some pairs will have matching bits. Therefore, at least 3 groups are needed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `1335890506`, `811593141`, and `1128223362`. By checking their binary representations, it can be seen that they can be split into two groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `688873446`, `627404104`, `1520079543`, and `1458610201`. By checking their binary representations, it can be seen that they can be split into two groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `61545621`, `2085938026`, `1269342732`, and `1430258575`. By checking their binary representations, it can be seen that they cannot all be grouped together because some pairs will have matching bits. Therefore, at least 3 groups are needed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `0`, `0`, `2147483647`, and `2147483647`. The binary representation of `0` is `00000000000000000000000000000000` and the binary representation of `2147483647` is `11111111111111111111111111111111`. Since no two bits match, the two `0`s can be in the same group, and the two `2147483647`s can be in another group.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `0`, `0`, and `2147483647`. The binary representation of `0` is `00000000000000000000000000000000` and the binary representation of `2147483647` is `11111111111111111111111111111111`. Since no two bits match, the two `0`s can be in the same group, and the `2147483647` can be in another group.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The numbers are `1858058912`, `289424735`, `1858058912`, `2024818580`, `1858058912`, `289424735`, `122665067`, and `289424735`. By checking their binary representations, it can be seen that they cannot all be grouped together because some pairs will have matching bits. Therefore, at least 4 groups are needed.
