```
*Explanation*: After removing the edge 1-3, the tree splits into two components: one with 2 vertices (1, 2) and another with 3 vertices (3, 4, 5). The smallest component has 2 vertices, so the answer is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: After removing any edge, the tree splits into two components, each with 1 vertex. The smallest component has 1 vertex, so the answer is 1.

# Test 3

**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: After removing any edge, the tree splits into two components, each with 3 vertices. The smallest component has 3 vertices, but since we are looking for the minimum size of the largest component, the answer is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: After removing the edge 1-2 or 1-3, the tree splits into two components: one with 1 vertex and another with 2 vertices. The smallest component has 1 vertex, but the largest component has 2 vertices, so the answer is 2.
