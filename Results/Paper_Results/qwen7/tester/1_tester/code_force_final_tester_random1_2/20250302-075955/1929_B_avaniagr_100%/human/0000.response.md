# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \). We need to color at least 2 cells such that 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The example provided in the problem description shows this.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This is another basic test case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \). We need to color at least 2 cells such that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The example provided in the problem description shows this.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \). Since there are only 8 diagonals in a \( 3 \times 3 \) grid, we need to color all 6 cells to satisfy the condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \). We need to color 5 out of the 6 cells to ensure that 9 out of the 8 diagonals have at least one colored cell. Coloring 5 cells will cover 9 diagonals since the last diagonal will be covered by the 6th cell.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \). We need to color at least 4 cells such that 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The example provided in the problem description shows this.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \). We need to color at least 6 cells such that 11 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The example provided in the problem description shows this.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This is a basic test case where \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \). We need to color at least 2 cells such that 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The example provided in the problem description shows this.

# Edge Test Case 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This is an edge case where \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 4 \). There are only 4 diagonals in a \( 2 \times 2 \) grid, so we need to color both cells to satisfy the condition.

# Edge Test Case 2
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
This is an edge case where \( n = 100000000 \) and \( k = 1 \). We need to color at least 1 cell such that 1 diagonal has at least one colored cell. The smallest possible value for \( k \) is 1, so coloring just one cell will suffice.

# Edge Test Case 3
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
```
**Explanation**: 
This is an edge case where \( n = 100000000 \) and \( k = 400000000 \). Since \( k \) is greater than the total number of diagonals (which is \( 4 \times 100000000 - 2 = 399999998 \)), we need to color all cells to satisfy the condition.

# Edge Test Case 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
This is an edge case where \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \). We need to color at least 2 cells such that 2 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The example provided in the problem description shows this.

# Edge Test Case 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3 8
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: 
This is an edge case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 8 \). Since there are only 8 diagonals in a \( 3 \times 3 \) grid, we need to color all 6 cells to satisfy the condition.
