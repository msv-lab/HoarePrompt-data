1. **Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all players have zero points.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     0 0 0
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     0

2. **Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the second player has one point and the third player has one point.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     0 1 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     1
     ```

3. **Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the scores are equal and all players have one point.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1 1 1
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     -1
     ```

4. **Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the scores are such that the maximum number of draws can be calculated.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1 1 2
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     2
     ```

5. **Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the scores are such that no valid set of games can achieve these scores.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     3 3 3
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     -1
     ```

6. **Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the scores are such that a large number of draws can be calculated.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     3 4 5
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     6
     ```

7. **Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when the scores are such that a large number of draws can be calculated.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1 1 10
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     2
     ```

### Edge Test Cases

8. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum score condition where all players have zero points.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     0 0 0
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     0
     ```

9. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the second player has the minimum score and the third player has the maximum score.
   - **Input**:
     ```
     0 1 3
     ```
   - **Output**:
     ```
     -1
     ```

10. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the second player has the minimum score and the third player has the middle score.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      0 1 2
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
     -1
      ```

11. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the scores are such that the maximum number of draws can be calculated but the sum of points does not match the expected pattern.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      2 3 5
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
     -1
      ```

12. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the scores are such that the maximum number of draws can be calculated but the distribution of points is not possible.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      1 2 4
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
     -1
      ```

13. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the scores are such that the maximum number of draws can be calculated but the distribution of points is not possible due to an odd number of total points.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      1 2 3
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
     -1
      ```

14. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the scores are such that the maximum number of draws can be calculated but the distribution of points is not possible due to an invalid combination.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      2 4 6
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
     -1
      ```

15. **Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the scores are such that the maximum number of draws can be calculated but the distribution of points is not possible due to an invalid combination.
    - **Input**:
      ```
      1 3 5
      ```
    - **Output**:
      ```
     -1
      ```
