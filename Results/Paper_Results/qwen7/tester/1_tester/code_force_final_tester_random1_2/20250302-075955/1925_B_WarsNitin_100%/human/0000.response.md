To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small value of \( x \) and a small value of \( n \).

**Input**:
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to split the problem into difficulties 4, 2, and 4, resulting in a GCD of 2.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a medium value of \( x \) and a medium value of \( n \).

**Input**:
```
1
24 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to split the problem into difficulties 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, and 4, resulting in a GCD of 2.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large value of \( x \) and a large value of \( n \).

**Input**:
```
1
420 69
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to split the problem into difficulties 6, 6, ..., 6 (69 times), resulting in a GCD of 6.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum value of \( x \).

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only way to split the problem is into a single problem with difficulty 1, resulting in a GCD of 1.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum value of \( n \).

**Input**:
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The only way to split the problem is into a single problem with difficulty 10, resulting in a GCD of 10.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function when \( x \) is divisible by \( n \).

**Input**:
```
1
12 3
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to split the problem into difficulties 4, 4, and 4, resulting in a GCD of 4.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function when \( x \) is not divisible by \( n \).

**Input**:
```
1
11 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to split the problem into difficulties 4, 4, and 3, resulting in a GCD of 1.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum value of \( x \) and \( n \).

**Input**:
```
1
100000000 100000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal solution is to split the problem into difficulties 1, 1, ..., 1 (100000000 times), resulting in a GCD of 1.
