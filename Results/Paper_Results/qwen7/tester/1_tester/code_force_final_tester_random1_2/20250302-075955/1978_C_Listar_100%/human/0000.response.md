# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
3 1 2
```
*Explanation*: The Manhattan value of the permutation [3, 1, 2] is \(|3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4\), which matches the required value of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: It can be proven that there is no permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
7 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
*Explanation*: The Manhattan value of the permutation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is \(|1-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| + |4-4| + |5-5| + |6-6| + |7-7| = 0\), which matches the required value of 0.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1 1000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: For \(n = 1\), the only possible permutation is [1], and its Manhattan value is \(|1-1| = 0\). Since \(k = 1000000000000\) is much larger than 0, no such permutation exists.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
8 14
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
```
*Explanation*: The Manhattan value of the permutation [8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7] is calculated as follows:
\[|8-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| + |4-4| + |5-5| + |6-6| + |1-7| + |7-8| = 7 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 1 = 14\]

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
112 777
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: Given \(n = 112\), the maximum possible Manhattan value is achieved when the permutation is [112, 111, 110, ..., 1]. The maximum value would be:
\[|112-1| + |111-2| + ... + |1-112| = 111 + 109 + 107 + ... + 1 = 6234\]
Since \(k = 777\) is less than 6234 but still a large number, we need to check if it's feasible. However, constructing such a permutation directly is complex and generally not feasible without specific patterns, hence the answer is "No".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
5 12
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
5 4 3 1 2
```
*Explanation*: The Manhattan value of the permutation [5, 4, 3, 1, 2] is calculated as follows:
\[|5-1| + |4-2| + |3-3| + |1-4| + |2-5| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 12\]

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
5 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
2 1 3 4 5
```
*Explanation*: The Manhattan value of the permutation [2, 1, 3, 4, 5] is calculated as follows:
\[|2-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| + |4-4| + |5-5| = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2\]
