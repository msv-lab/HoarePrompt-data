### Test Cases

#### 1. Basic Test Cases

**Test 1**
**Input**: 
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The chips are initially in positions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. Moving the chip in position 7 to position 5 will make all chips form a single block.

**Test 2**
**Input**: 
```
6
6
0 1 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All chips are already in a single block.

**Test 3**
**Input**: 
```
6
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cells contain chips, so no moves are needed.

**Test 4**
**Input**: 
```
5
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Move the chip in position 3 to position 2, then move the chip in position 5 to position 4. Now all chips are in a single block.

**Test 5**
**Input**: 
```
9
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Move the chip in position 9 to position 7, then move the chip in position 9 again to position 5, and finally move the chip in position 9 to position 3. Now all chips are in a single block.

#### 2. Edge Test Cases

**Test 6**
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are only two cells, both containing chips, so no moves are needed.

**Test 7**
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cells are occupied by chips, so no moves are needed.

**Test 8**
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Move the chip in position 4 to position 3. Now all chips are in a single block.

**Test 9**
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Move the chip in position 3 to position 2. Now all chips are in a single block.

**Test 10**
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Move the chip in position 2 to position 1. Now all chips are in a single block.

**Test 11**
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: Move the chip in position 2 to position 1, chip in position 4 to position 3, chip in position 6 to position 5, chip in position 8 to position 7, and chip in position 10 to position 9. Now all chips are in a single block.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
