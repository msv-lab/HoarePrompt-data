# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where the phone can send all messages without needing to turn off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 3 1 5
3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 3 units of charge. Sending a message at moment 3 would consume 3 units of charge, leaving the phone with 0 units of charge. Therefore, it is not possible to send the message.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where the phone can send all messages by turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
7 21 1 3
4 6 10 13 17 20 26
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 21 units of charge. By strategically turning off and on, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality where the phone can send all messages with minimal charge consumption.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. By turning off and on at strategic moments, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone cannot send all messages due to insufficient initial charge.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1 unit of charge and consumes 1 unit per minute. Since the first message is sent at moment 1000000000, the phone will run out of charge before sending the message.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone cannot send all messages due to insufficient charge even after turning off and on.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 11 units of charge. After sending the first message at moment 6, the phone will have 2 units left. Turning off and on at moment 6 will cost 6 units, leaving the phone with -4 units, which is not possible. Thus, the phone cannot send all messages.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can send all messages with large numbers and minimal charge consumption.

**Input**: 
```
1
12 1123456789 1 2
51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1123456789 units of charge. Even with minimal charge consumption per minute, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone cannot send all messages due to large gaps between messages.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 11 units of charge. After sending the first message at moment 6, the phone will have 2 units left. Turning off and on at moment 6 will cost 6 units, leaving the phone with -4 units, which is not possible. Thus, the phone cannot send all messages.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can send all messages with large gaps between messages and minimal charge consumption.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1000000000 1 2
1 1000000000 2000000000 3000000000 4000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 1000000000 units of charge. Even with large gaps between messages, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone cannot send all messages due to large gaps and high charge consumption.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 11 units of charge. After sending the first message at moment 6, the phone will have 2 units left. Turning off and on at moment 6 will cost 6 units, leaving the phone with -4 units, which is not possible. Thus, the phone cannot send all messages.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can send all messages with minimal charge consumption and small gaps.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 10 1 2
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge. By turning off and on at strategic moments, the phone can manage to send all messages without running out of charge.

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone cannot send all messages due to insufficient initial charge and large gaps.

**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1 2
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The phone starts with 10 units of charge and consumes 1 unit per minute. Since the first message is sent at moment 1000000000, the phone will run out of charge before sending the message.

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the phone can send all messages with minimal charge consumption and large gaps.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1000000000 1 2
1 1000000000 2000000000 3000000000 4000000000
