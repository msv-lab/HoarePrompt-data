# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [1, 2]. The optimal permutation is [2, 1], resulting in the array [3, 3], where the number 3 appears twice.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [7, 1, 4, 1]. The optimal permutation is [2, 3, 1, 4], resulting in the array [9, 4, 5, 5], where the number 5 appears twice.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
103 102 104
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [103, 102, 104]. The optimal permutation is [1, 2, 3], resulting in the array [104, 104, 104], where the number 104 appears three times.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 101 1 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [1, 101, 1, 100, 1]. The optimal permutation is [2, 1, 4, 3, 5], resulting in the array [3, 102, 6, 104, 6], where the number 6 appears twice.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 10 100 1000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [1, 10, 100, 1000, 1]. The optimal permutation is [2, 1, 4, 3, 5], resulting in the array [3, 11, 104, 1003, 6], where no number repeats more than once.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [3, 1]. The optimal permutation is [2, 1], resulting in the array [5, 3], where the number 3 appears only once.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 999999997 999999999
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The input array is [1000000000, 999999997, 999999999]. The optimal permutation is [2, 1, 3], resulting in the array [1000000002, 999999998, 999999999], where the number 999999999 appears twice.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: Both test cases involve an array of length 1. The optimal permutation is trivially the identity permutation, resulting in the same array, where the number 1 appears once.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
5
```
*Explanation*: In both test cases, the input array is a permutation of numbers from 1 to 5. The optimal permutation is the identity permutation, resulting in the same array, where each number appears once.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
4
1 1 1 1
4
2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
4
```
*Explanation*: In both test cases, all elements in the array are identical. The optimal permutation is the identity permutation, resulting in the same array, where the number 1 (or 2) appears four times.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The input array is a permutation of numbers from 1 to 10. The optimal permutation is the identity permutation, resulting in the same array, where no number repeats.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The input array is a reverse permutation of numbers from 1 to 10. The optimal permutation is the identity permutation, resulting in the same array, where no number repeats.
