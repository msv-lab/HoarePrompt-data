# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1]. No swaps are performed, so the position of 1 remains 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2]. No swaps are performed since the only possible swap would be \(\texttt{swap}(2)\), but \(d\) for \(k=2\) is 1, and swapping \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) does not change the array. Therefore, the position of 1 remains 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3]. Swapping \(\texttt{swap}(2)\) results in [2, 1, 3]. No further swaps are performed, so the position of 1 is 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, 4]. Swapping \(\texttt{swap}(2)\) results in [2, 1, 3, 4], \(\texttt{swap}(3)\) results in [2, 1, 4, 3], and \(\texttt{swap}(4)\) results in [2, 1, 4, \underline{3}], so the position of 1 is 4.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Swapping \(\texttt{swap}(2)\) results in [2, 1, 3, 4, 5], \(\texttt{swap}(3)\) results in [2, 1, 4, 3, 5], \(\texttt{swap}(4)\) results in [2, 1, 4, 5, 3], and \(\texttt{swap}(5)\) results in [2, 1, 4, 5, \underline{3}], so the position of 1 is 4.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Swapping \(\texttt{swap}(2)\) results in [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], \(\texttt{swap}(3)\) results in [2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], \(\texttt{swap}(4)\) results in [2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and so on until \(\texttt{swap}(10)\) results in [2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, \underline{10}], so the position of 1 is 8.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
96
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, ..., 100]. The position of 1 will move based on the largest divisor of each index. After all swaps, the position of 1 will be at 96.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999996
```
**Explanation**: The array is initially [1, 2, ..., 1000000000]. The position of 1 will move based on the largest divisor of each index. After all swaps, the position of 1 will be at 999999996.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
999999996
```
**Explanation**: This tests the function with two different inputs to ensure consistency.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
2
3
4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
4
```
**Explanation**: Tests the function with three different inputs to ensure consistency across multiple cases.
