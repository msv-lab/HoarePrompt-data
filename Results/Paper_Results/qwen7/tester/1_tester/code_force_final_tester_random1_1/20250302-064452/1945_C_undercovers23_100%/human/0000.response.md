**Output**: 
```

```
*Explanation*: If the road is laid after the first house, only one resident (a_1) is on the left side, and no one is satisfied because \(\lceil \frac{1}{2} \rceil = 1\). Laying the road after the second house satisfies both sides: \(\lceil \frac{2}{2} \rceil = 1\) on the left and \(\lceil \frac{1}{2} \rceil = 1\) on the right.*

```
*Explanation*: Laying the road after the third house ensures that 2 out of 3 residents on the left side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\)) and 2 out of 3 residents on the right side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\)).*

*Explanation*: Laying the road after the second house ensures that 1 out of 2 residents on the left side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{2}{2} \rceil = 1\)) and 2 out of 3 residents on the right side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\)).*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Since the road can be laid before the first house, all residents are on the left side, and all are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\)).*

*Explanation*: For the first test case, laying the road after the third house ensures that 3 out of 3 residents on the left side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\)) and 4 out of 4 residents on the right side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2\)). For the second test case, laying the road after the fourth house ensures that 3 out of 3 residents on the left side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2\)) and 3 out of 4 residents on the right side are satisfied (\(\lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2\)).*
