To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s how we can structure our test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a simple polygon with a small number of sides and vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3, and being able to choose 1 additional vertex, the maximum number of triangles is 1 (formed by vertices 1, 2, and 3).

#### Test Case 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a medium-sized polygon.

**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, choosing vertices 1, 2, 5, and 6, and being able to choose 2 additional vertices, the maximum number of triangles is 6.

#### Test Case 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a large polygon.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 500000 500000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 500000
```
**Output**:
```
499998
```
**Explanation**: With a very large polygon, choosing 500000 vertices and being able to choose another 500000 vertices, the maximum number of triangles is \(500000 + 500000 - 2 = 499998\).

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 4
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the minimum number of vertices chosen.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3, and not being able to choose any additional vertices, the maximum number of triangles is 1.

#### Test Case 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the maximum number of vertices chosen.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3, and being able to choose 2 additional vertices, the maximum number of triangles is 3.

#### Test Case 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of chosen vertices plus the number of additional vertices equals the total number of vertices minus 2.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3, and being able to choose 2 additional vertices, the maximum number of triangles is 3.

#### Test Case 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of chosen vertices plus the number of additional vertices is less than the total number of vertices minus 2.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3, and being able to choose 1 additional vertex, the maximum number of triangles is 1.

#### Test Case 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of chosen vertices is equal to the total number of vertices minus 2.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3, and not being able to choose any additional vertices, the maximum number of triangles is 1.

#### Test Case 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of chosen vertices is equal to the total number of vertices minus 1.

**Input**:
```
1
4 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1, 2, and 3, and not being able to choose any additional vertices, the maximum number of triangles is 1.

#### Test Case 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of chosen vertices is equal to the total number of vertices minus 2 and the number of additional vertices is 0.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, choosing vertices 1 and 3, and not being able to choose any additional vertices, the maximum number of triangles is 1.
