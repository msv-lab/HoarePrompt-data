# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
16 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushrooms at indices 1 and 2. The minimum magic power is 8, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 2. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(2 \times 8 = 16\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
9 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushrooms at indices 1, 2, and 3. The minimum magic power is 1, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 3. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(3 \times 1 = 3\). However, since the question asks for the minimum number of mushrooms needed, we consider the smallest set of mushrooms that gives the maximum strength, which is picking mushrooms with indices 2, 3, and 4, giving a strength of \(3 \times 2 = 6\), but the correct minimum number of mushrooms is 3.

8 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushrooms at indices 1 and 2. The minimum magic power is 1, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 2. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(2 \times 1 = 2\). However, since the question asks for the minimum number of mushrooms needed, we consider the smallest set of mushrooms that gives the maximum strength, which is picking mushrooms with indices 3 and 4, giving a strength of \(2 \times 3 = 6\), but the correct minimum number of mushrooms is 2.

1 4 6 10 10
2 1 4 5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushrooms at indices 4 and 5. The minimum magic power is 10, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 2. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 2 5 5

```
**Output**: 
```
5 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushroom at index 2. The minimum magic power is 2, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 1. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(1 \times 2 = 2\). However, since the question asks for the minimum number of mushrooms needed, we consider the smallest set of mushrooms that gives the maximum strength, which is picking mushroom with index 2, giving a strength of \(1 \times 2 = 2\), but the correct minimum number of mushrooms is 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 9 10 10

```
**Output**: 
```
20 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushrooms at indices 4 and 5. The minimum magic power is 10, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 2. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
10 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- There is only one mushroom, and its magic power is 10. Since no other mushrooms are available, Kirill picks the only mushroom. The strength of the elixir is \(1 \times 10 = 10\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushroom at index 1. The minimum magic power is 1, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 1. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(1 \times 1 = 1\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 3
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick all three mushrooms. The minimum magic power is 1, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 3. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(3 \times 1 = 3\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1

```
**Output**: 
```
30 2
```
**Explanation**: 
- Kirill needs to pick mushrooms at indices 1 and 2. The minimum magic power is 10, and the total number of mushrooms picked is 2. Therefore, the strength of the elixir is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).
