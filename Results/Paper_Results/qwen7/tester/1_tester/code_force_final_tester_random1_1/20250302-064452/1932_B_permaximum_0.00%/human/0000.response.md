```
1
2
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000

**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
**Explanation**: This tests a case where both periodicities are the same. The result should be the periodicity itself.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: This tests a case where the periodicities are prime numbers. The result should be the LCM of the periodicities, which is their product in this case.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 4 8
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: This tests a case where the periodicities are powers of the same base. The result should be the largest periodicity.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
12
```
**Explanation**: This tests a case where the periodicities are not multiples of each other but have a common multiple. The result should be the LCM of the periodicities.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Explanation**: This tests a case where the periodicities are consecutive integers. The result should be the LCM of the periodicities, which is their product in this case.

**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This tests a case where all periodicities are the same. The result should be the periodicity itself.

**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 15 20
```
**Output**: 
```
60
```
