# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The tree is given in the problem statement example. Removing the edge between nodes 1 and 3 results in two connected components: one with 2 nodes and another with 3 nodes. The smallest component has 2 nodes, so the answer is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: There is only one edge, and removing it leaves two nodes in separate components. Thus, the smallest component has 1 node, and the answer is 1.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
6 1
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Removing any single edge will result in at least one component with 1 node. Therefore, the answer is 1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Removing any edge will leave the other two nodes in separate components. Since the smallest component has 2 nodes, the answer is 3.

# Test 5

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Removing any two edges will result in at least one component with 1 node. Therefore, the answer is 1.

# Test 6

```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Removing two edges can result in components of sizes 2 and 4. The smallest component has 2 nodes, so the answer is 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Removing three edges can result in components of sizes 1, 1, and 4. The smallest component has 1 node, but since we need at least one component with more than 1 node, the smallest valid component size is 2.

# Test 8
**Input**:

**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Removing four edges can result in components of sizes 2, 2, 2, and 4. The smallest component has 2 nodes, so the answer is 2.

# Test 9

**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Removing five edges can result in components of sizes 1, 1, 1, 2, and 4. The smallest component has 1 node, but since we need at least one component with more than 1 node, the smallest valid component size is 2.

# Test 10

**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Removing nine edges will result in ten components of size 1. Therefore, the answer is 1.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
1 0
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
1
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, no edges need to be removed, so the entire tree remains in one component with 1 node. For the second test case, removing the edge between nodes 1 and 2 results in two components, each with 1 node.
