To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a simple case where chips are already in a single block.
**Input**:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All chips are already in a single block, no operations are needed.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where chips are spread out but can be moved to form a single block with minimal operations.
**Input**:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell forms a single block.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where all cells contain chips.
**Input**:
```
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cells already contain chips, no operations are needed.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where chips are spread out and require multiple operations to form a single block.
**Input**:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two operations are required to move the chips to form a single block.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum number of cells (n=2).
**Input**:
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one cell is free, no operations are needed.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum number of cells (n=50).
**Input**:
```
50
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
25
```
**Explanation**: There are 25 chips and 25 free cells. Each chip needs to move to the next free cell, requiring 25 operations.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where only one chip is present.
**Input**:
```
3
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one chip is present, no operations are needed.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the last cell contains a chip and all other cells are free.
**Input**:
```
4
0 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Three operations are required to move the chip to the first cell.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the first cell contains a chip and all other cells are free.
**Input**:
```
4
1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The chip is already in the first cell, no operations are needed.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a case where the middle cell contains a chip and all other cells are free.
**Input**:
```
5
0 1 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two operations are required to move the chip to the first cell.
