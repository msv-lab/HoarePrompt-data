To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small polygon and a few chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, Bessie has chosen 4 vertices, and you can choose 2 more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 6.

#### Test Case 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a medium-sized polygon and a moderate number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
7 3 1
6 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: With 7 sides, Bessie has chosen 3 vertices, and you can choose 1 more vertex. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 5.

#### Test Case 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large polygon and a small number of chosen vertices.
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices, and you can choose 2 more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 4
**Objective**: Verify the function when the polygon has the minimum number of sides (4).
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices, and you can choose 2 more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

#### Test Case 5
**Objective**: Verify the function when the number of chosen vertices is at its maximum.
**Input**:
```
1
8 7 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, Bessie has chosen 7 vertices, and you cannot choose any more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test Case 6
**Objective**: Verify the function when the number of chosen vertices is at its minimum.
**Input**:
```
1
8 2 2
1 6
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices, and you can choose 2 more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 3.

#### Test Case 7
**Objective**: Verify the function when the number of chosen vertices is just enough to form one triangle.
**Input**:
```
1
6 3 0
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides, Bessie has chosen 3 vertices, and you cannot choose any more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test Case 8
**Objective**: Verify the function when the number of chosen vertices is just enough to form multiple triangles.
**Input**:
```
1
8 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides, Bessie has chosen 4 vertices, and you cannot choose any more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test Case 9
**Objective**: Verify the function when the number of sides is at its maximum limit.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, Bessie has chosen 2 vertices, and you can choose 1 more vertex. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test Case 10
**Objective**: Verify the function when the number of chosen vertices is close to the maximum limit.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999998 1
1 2 3 ... 999999998
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides, Bessie has chosen 999,999,998 vertices, and you can choose 1 more vertex. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
