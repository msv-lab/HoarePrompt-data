**Explanation**: For n = 25 and k = 24, we need subsequences that add up to 1 through 23 and 25, but not one that adds up to 24. The sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25]` satisfies this condition.

# Test 39
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where n is exactly 25 and k is 23.
