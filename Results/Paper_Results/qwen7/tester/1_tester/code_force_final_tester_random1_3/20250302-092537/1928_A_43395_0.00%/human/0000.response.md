# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 6x3 rectangle can only be cut into two 6x1 or 3x3 rectangles, and these cannot form any other distinct rectangle.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 10x10 rectangle can be cut into two 10x5 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 5x20 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 1000000000x1 rectangle can only be cut into 1x1000000000 rectangles, and these cannot form any other distinct rectangle.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 1x1000000000 rectangle can only be cut into 1x1000000000 rectangles, and these cannot form any other distinct rectangle.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 4x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form an 8x2 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 5x5 rectangle can be cut into two 5x2.5 rectangles, but since we are dealing with integers, it can be cut into two 5x2 rectangles and one 5x1 rectangle, which can be rearranged to form a 10x2.5 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 15
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 10x15 rectangle can be cut into two 10x7.5 rectangles, but since we are dealing with integers, it can be cut into two 10x7 and one 10x1 rectangle, which can be rearranged to form a 20x7.5 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 10x10 rectangle can be cut into two 10x5 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 5x20 rectangle, which is different from the original.
