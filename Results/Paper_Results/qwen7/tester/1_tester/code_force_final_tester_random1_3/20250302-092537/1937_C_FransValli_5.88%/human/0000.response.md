**Output**:
```
? 0 2 3 1
<

? 1 1 2 3
=

? 1 2 0 3
>

? 4 5 6 7

? 4 6 5 7
<

? 4 7 5 6
=

! 7 4

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the solution with the smallest possible permutation.

**Input**:
```

? 0 2 1 3
<

? 0 3 1 2
=

! 0 3
```

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the solution with a permutation where the maximum XOR is achieved by non-adjacent elements.

**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 1 3

? 0 1 2 3
<

? 0 3 1 2
=

! 2 3
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the solution with a permutation where the maximum XOR is achieved by elements with the same parity.

**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 2 1 3

? 0 1 2 3
<

? 0 3 1 2
=

! 0 2
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the solution with a permutation where the maximum XOR is achieved by elements with different parities.

**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
>

? 0 3 1 2
<

? 0 2 1 3
=

! 1 3
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the solution with a permutation where the maximum XOR is achieved by elements with mixed parities.

**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
>

? 0 3 1 2
<

? 0 2 1 3
=

! 0 3
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the solution with a permutation where the maximum XOR is achieved by elements with mixed parities but different order.

**Input**:
```
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
>

? 0 3 1 2
<

? 0 2 1 3
=

! 1 3
```
