# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small example where Kirill can easily move to the front without much cost.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move from position 4 to position 2. He pays 9 coins to the person at position 3 and 3 coins to the person at position 2, totaling 12 coins. However, moving to position 1 would cost 7 + 3 = 10 coins, which is more than 14 coins, so the minimum is 14 coins.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Check if the solution handles a scenario where Kirill cannot move to the desired position due to high costs.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
9 7 6 3
5 8 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
17
```
**Explanation**: Moving to position 2 would cost 7 + 8 = 15 coins, and moving to position 1 would cost 9 + 7 = 16 coins. Therefore, the minimum cost is 17 coins, which is the cost of moving to position 2.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Evaluate the solution with a large number of people in the queue.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Explanation**: Moving to position 2 would cost 9 + 5 = 14 coins, and moving to position 1 would cost 6 + 8 + 5 = 19 coins. Therefore, the minimum cost is 22 coins, which is the cost of moving to position 2.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Test the scenario where Kirill needs to move to the last allowed position.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Moving to position 6 would cost 2 + 9 + 1 + 4 = 16 coins, and moving to position 7 would cost 2 + 9 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 25 coins. Therefore, the minimum cost is 9 coins, which is the cost of moving to position 6.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Check the scenario where Kirill can only move to the last position.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Moving to position 1 would cost 1 coin, and moving to position 2 would cost 3 coins. Therefore, the minimum cost is 3 coins, which is the cost of moving to position 1.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Test the scenario where all costs are high, and Kirill has to move to the last allowed position.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3000000000
```
**Explanation**: Moving to position 2 would cost 1000000000 * 2 = 2000000000 coins, and moving to position 1 would cost 1000000000 * 3 = 3000000000 coins. Therefore, the minimum cost is 3000000000 coins, which is the cost of moving to position 2.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Check the scenario where the queue size is at the upper limit.
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
1000000000 1000000000 ... (200000 elements)
1000000000 1000000000 ... (200000 elements)
```
**Output**: 
```
300000000000000
```
**Explanation**: Moving to position 100000 would cost 1000000000 * 100000 = 300000000000000 coins. Therefore, the minimum cost is 300000000000000 coins, which is the cost of moving to position 100000.
