# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of the subarray [0, 1] is 2. Setting all elements in the subarray to 2 results in the array [2, 2], which has a sum of 4.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of any subarray is at least 0, but setting all elements to 0 would result in a smaller sum. Hence, no operations are needed, and the sum remains 13.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of the subarray [2] is 0, and setting all elements in the subarray to 0 results in the array [1, 100, 0, 1]. Then, the MEX of the subarray [0, 1] is 2, and setting all elements in the subarray to 2 results in the array [1, 100, 2, 2], which has a sum of 105.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of the subarray [0] is 1. Setting all elements in the subarray to 1 results in the array [1], which has a sum of 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
5 5
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of any single-element subarray is 1. Setting each element to 1 results in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which has a sum of 5.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
21 6
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of any single-element subarray is 0. Setting each element to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a sum of 0. However, since we can set each element individually, the sum remains 21.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
8
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
8 8
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
6 6
7 7
8 8
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of any single-element subarray is 0. Setting each element to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which has a sum of 0. However, since we can set each element individually, the sum remains 8.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
3
10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
30000000 3
1 1
2 2
3 3
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of any single-element subarray is 0. Setting each element to 0 results in the array [0, 0, 0], which has a sum of 0. However, since we can set each element individually, the sum remains 30000000.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
10000000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
20000000 1
1 2
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of the subarray [10000000, 0] is 1. Setting all elements in the subarray to 1 results in the array [1, 1], which has a sum of 20000000.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
*Explanation*: The MEX of the subarray [10000000] is 0. Setting all elements in the subarray to 0 results in the array [0], which has a sum of 1.
