**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The total sum of the array is 55, which is not divisible by 3, making it impossible to reduce all elements to zero.

# Test 12

```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: Each element is 1, and there is no way to reduce them to zero using the given operations.

# Test 13
