# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 pages.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 1 from the second pile. However, since we want the maximum total, we consider the highest possible sum which is 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 2 3 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put books with numbers 3 and 5 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1, 2, and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 2 from the second pile. However, to maximize the total, we consider the highest possible sum which is 3 + 2 = 5 pages.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
13
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 10 + 3 = 13 pages.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put books with numbers 1 and 3 in the first pile, and book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 2 from the second pile. However, to maximize the total, we consider the highest possible sum which is 3 + 2 = 5 pages.

# Test 6
**Input**:

2
1000000000 1000000000
4
1 1000000000 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000
2000000000
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, Alice can put both books in the same pile, thus reading both books. In the second test case, Alice can put the book with 1 page in one pile and the two books with 1000000000 pages in the other pile, thus reading 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000 pages.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
19
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put the books with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 in one pile, and the books with numbers 9 and 10 in the other pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 10 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 9 from the second pile. The maximum total is 10 + 9 = 19 pages.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3000000000
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put all three books in the same pile, thus reading all three books. The maximum total is 1000000000 + 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 3000000000 pages.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put book number 1 in one pile and book number 2 in the other pile. The maximum total is 1 + 1000000000 = 1000000001 pages.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put all ten books in the same pile, thus reading all ten books. The maximum total is 1000000000 * 10 = 10000000000 pages.
