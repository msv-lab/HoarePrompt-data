```
36
```
*Explanation*: This is the basic test case provided in the example. It checks the core functionality of the algorithm.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every consecutive year, so the nth sign will occur in the nth year.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every year, so the nth sign will occur in the nth year.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: There is only one sign, and it occurs every 1000000 years, so the nth sign (which is the only sign) will occur in 1000000 years.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 2, and the second sign occurs in year 4 (after the first sign), so the second sign occurs in year 4.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 1, the second sign occurs in year 3 (after the first sign), and the third sign occurs in year 6 (after the second sign).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 10 15 20
```
**Output**: 
```
60
```
*Explanation*: The first sign occurs in year 5, the second sign occurs in year 15 (after the first sign), the third sign occurs in year 30 (after the second sign), and the fourth sign occurs in year 60 (after the third sign).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
**Output**: 
```
2012
```
*Explanation*: This is the example provided in the problem statement. It checks the core functionality with larger numbers.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: There is only one sign, and it occurs every year, so the nth sign (which is the only sign) will occur in the first year.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
```
**Output**: 
```
2520
```
*Explanation*: The least common multiple (LCM) of the series 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 is 2520.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every 1000 years, so the nth sign will occur in 1000 years.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
2520
```
*Explanation*: The least common multiple (LCM) of the series 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 is 2520.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every 1000000 years, so the nth sign will occur in 1000000 years.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every year, so the nth sign will occur in the nth year.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: All signs occur every 10 years, so the nth sign will occur in 10 years.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: The least common multiple (LCM) of the series 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1000000 is 1000000.

# Test 17
