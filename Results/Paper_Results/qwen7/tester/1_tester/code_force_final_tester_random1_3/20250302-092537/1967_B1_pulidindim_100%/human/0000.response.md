# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Only the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition \(1 \le a \le 1\) and \(1 \le b \le 1\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2) satisfy the conditions. Pair (2, 3) does not because \(2 + 3 = 5\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 4) satisfy the conditions. Pair (3, 5) does not because \(3 + 5 = 8\) is not a multiple of \(5 \cdot \gcd(3, 5) = 5\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10 8
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), and (10, 2) satisfy the conditions.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1233
```
**Output**: 
```
153
```
*Explanation*: This case involves larger values but follows the same logic as smaller inputs. The exact pairs can be calculated using the provided logic.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1145141
```
**Output**: 
```
1643498
```
*Explanation*: This is a large input case where the solution needs to handle very large numbers efficiently.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: In this case, \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 1, and \(b\) can take any value from 1 to 2000000. Since \(a + b\) will always be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) when \(a = 1\), there are 2000000 valid pairs.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: In this case, \(b\) can take any value from 1 to 1, and \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 2000000. Since \(a + b\) will always be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) when \(b = 1\), there are 2000000 valid pairs.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Similar to Test 7, but with \(b\) taking values up to 1000000 and \(a = 1\). There are 1000000 valid pairs.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Both \(a\) and \(b\) can take values from 1 to 1000000. For each \(a\), \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) when \(b = a\), giving us 1000000 valid pairs.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 1) satisfy the conditions. Pair (2, 2) does not because \(2 + 2 = 4\) is not a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 1) satisfy the conditions. Pair (3, 3) does not because \(3 + 3 = 6\) is not a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(3, 3) = 3\).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), and (2, 1) satisfy the conditions. Pair (5, 5) does not because \(5 + 5 = 10\) is not a multiple of \(5 \cdot \gcd(5, 5) = 5\).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(b = 1\) and \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 1000000. Since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\), there are 1000000 valid pairs.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(a = 1\) and \(b\) can take any value from 1 to 1000000. Since \(1 + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(1, b) = b\), there are 1000000 valid pairs.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 2, and \(b\) can take any value from 1 to 2000000. Since \(a + b\) will always be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) when \(a = 1\) or \(a = 2\), there are 2000000 valid pairs.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
2000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000
```
*Explanation*: Here, \(b\) can take any value from 1 to 2, and \(a\) can take any value from 1 to 2000000. Since \(a + b\) will always be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) when \(b = 1\) or \(b = 2\), there are 2000000 valid pairs.
