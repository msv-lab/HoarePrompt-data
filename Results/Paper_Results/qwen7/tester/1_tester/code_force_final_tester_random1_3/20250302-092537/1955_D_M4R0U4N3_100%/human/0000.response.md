**Explanation**: The subsegments of length 5 starting at positions 3, 4, 6, and 7 are [2, 2, 10, 9, 7], [2, 10, 9, 7, 6], [9, 7, 6, 3, 6], and [7, 6, 3, 6, 3]. These subsegments contain at least 3 elements from the array [6, 9, 7, 8, 10].

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1 1
4 1 5 6
6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The subsegment of length 1 starting at position 4 is [6]. This subsegment contains exactly 1 element from the array [6].

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1 1
1
1
1 1 1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, the single subsegment of length 1 starting at position 1 is [1], which contains exactly 1 element from the array [1]. For the second test case, there are no subsegments of length 1 that can contain at least 1 element from the array [2].

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
1 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The subsegment of length 2 starting at position 1 is [1, 2], which contains exactly 2 elements from the array [1, 2].

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The subsegments of length 1 starting at positions 1 and 2 are [1] and [2]. Both subsegments contain exactly 1 element from the array [1].

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The subsegments of length 5 starting at positions 1, 2, and 3 are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. These subsegments contain at least 3 elements from the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The subsegment of length 5 starting at position 1 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], which contains exactly 5 elements from the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles various input sizes and conditions effectively.
