# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: In this test case, the numbers are 1, 4, 3, and 4. The binary representations are 00000000000000000000000000000001, 00000000000000000000000000000100, 00000000000000000000000000000011, and 00000000000000000000000000000100 respectively. Since any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, each number must be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Here, the numbers are 0 and 2147483647. The binary representation of 0 is 00000000000000000000000000000000 and that of 2147483647 is 11111111111111111111111111111111. Since the bits are completely different, they can be placed in the same group.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different combinations of bits, and we need at least 3 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any position.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1335890506 811593141 1128223362
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different combinations of bits, and we need at least 2 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any position.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4
688873446 627404104 1520079543 1458610201
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different combinations of bits, and we need at least 2 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any position.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
4
61545621 2085938026 1269342732 1430258575
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have different combinations of bits, and we need at least 3 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any position.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two zeros and two maximum values share the same bits in some positions, but not all, requiring at least 2 groups.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: One zero and two maximum values share the same bits in some positions, but not all, requiring at least 2 groups.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
8
1858058912 289424735 1858058912 2024818580 1858058912 289424735 122665067 289424735
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The numbers have repeated patterns, and we need at least 4 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any position.
