To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1
**Input**:
```
3
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
7 3 1
6 4 3
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
6
5
2
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), and \( y = 2 \), the vertices chosen are 1, 6, 2, and 5. By choosing 2 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 6.
- For the second test case, with \( n = 7 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( y = 1 \), the vertices chosen are 6, 4, and 3. By choosing 1 additional vertex, we can maximize the number of triangles to 5.
- For the third test case, with \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 2 \), the vertices chosen are 1 and 3. By choosing 2 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 2.

#### Test Case 2
**Input**:
```
2
6 3 3
1 2 3
10 5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
4
10
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 6 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( y = 3 \), the vertices chosen are 1, 2, and 3. By choosing 3 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 4.
- For the second test case, with \( n = 10 \), \( x = 5 \), and \( y = 5 \), the vertices chosen are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. By choosing 5 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 10.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 3
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen are 1 and 3. Since no additional vertices can be chosen, the maximum number of triangles is 1.

#### Test Case 4
**Input**:
```
1
5 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 5 \), \( x = 4 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since no additional vertices can be chosen, the maximum number of triangles is 1.

#### Test Case 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
10
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 10 \), \( x = 5 \), and \( y = 5 \), the vertices chosen are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. By choosing 5 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 10.

#### Test Case 6
**Input**:
```
1
100 50 50
1 2 3 ... 50
```
**Output**:
```
100
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 100 \), \( x = 50 \), and \( y = 50 \), the vertices chosen are the first 50 vertices. By choosing the remaining 50 vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 100.

#### Test Case 7
**Input**:
```
1
10 10 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 10 \), \( x = 10 \), and \( y = 0 \), all vertices are chosen. Since no additional vertices can be chosen, the maximum number of triangles is 1.

#### Test Case 8
**Input**:
```
1
10 1 9
1
```
**Output**:
```
10
```

**Explanation**:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 10 \), \( x = 1 \), and \( y = 9 \), only vertex 1 is chosen. By choosing the remaining 9 vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 10.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including typical use cases and edge cases, ensuring the solution's robustness and reliability.
