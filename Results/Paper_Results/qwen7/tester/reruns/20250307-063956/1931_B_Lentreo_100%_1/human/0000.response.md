# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same (itself).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The single container has zero water, and it is trivially possible to keep it at zero.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The sum of water is 4, but it cannot be evenly distributed between two containers.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 15, and it can be evenly distributed among 5 containers (3 units per container).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 6, and it can be evenly distributed among 3 containers (2 units per container).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, but it cannot be evenly distributed among 7 containers (since 28/7 = 4, but there are non-zero elements that prevent an even distribution).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, but it cannot be evenly distributed among 7 containers (since 28/7 = 4, but there are non-zero elements that prevent an even distribution).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make the amount of water the same (itself).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 2 billion, and it can be evenly distributed among 2 containers (1 billion units per container).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 2 billion, but it cannot be evenly distributed among 3 containers (since 2 billion/3 is not an integer).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 10, and it can be evenly distributed among 10 containers (1 unit per container).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers have zero water, so it is trivially possible to keep them at zero.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 55, but it cannot be evenly distributed among 10 containers (since 55/10 is not an integer).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 20, and it can be evenly distributed among 10 containers (2 units per container).

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 11, but it cannot be evenly distributed among 10 containers (since 11/10 is not an integer).

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 12, but it cannot be evenly distributed among 10 containers (since 12/10 is not an integer).

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 13, but it cannot be evenly distributed among 10 containers (since 13/10 is not an integer).
