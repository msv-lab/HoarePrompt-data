Given the problem description, we will create comprehensive test cases for the described graph partitioning problem. We will cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Small Graph with Small k
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a small graph with a small value of \( k \).

**Input**:
```
3
2 3
```

**Output**:
```
2 1
1
1 1
```

**Explanation**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \). The condition \( |1 - 2| + |1 - 2| \le 3 \) holds true, so the entire graph forms a single clique.

#### Test 2: Medium Graph with Small k
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a medium-sized graph with a small value of \( k \).

**Input**:
```
3
5 4
```

**Output**:
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

**Explanation**: For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 3 \), \( a_3 = 5 \), \( a_4 = 2 \), and \( a_5 = 4 \). The pairs \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((4, 5)\) satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 4 \). Thus, we can partition the graph into two cliques: \(\{1, 2\}\) and \(\{3, 4, 5\}\).

#### Test 3: Large Graph with Small k
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a large graph with a small value of \( k \).

**Input**:
```
3
8 16
```

**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Explanation**: For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), \( a_4 = 4 \), \( a_5 = 5 \), \( a_6 = 6 \), \( a_7 = 7 \), and \( a_8 = 8 \). Since \( k = 16 \), all pairs \((i, j)\) satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 16 \), so the entire graph forms a single clique.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4: Small Graph with Large k
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a small graph with a large value of \( k \).

**Input**:
```
3
2 4
```

**Output**:
```
2 1
1
1 1
```

**Explanation**: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 4 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 2 \). The condition \( |1 - 2| + |1 - 2| \le 4 \) holds true, so the entire graph forms a single clique.

#### Test 5: Medium Graph with Large k
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a medium-sized graph with a large value of \( k \).

**Input**:
```
3
5 8
```

**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5
1
1 1 1 1 1
```

**Explanation**: For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 8 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), \( a_4 = 4 \), and \( a_5 = 5 \). Since \( k = 8 \), all pairs \((i, j)\) satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 8 \), so the entire graph forms a single clique.

#### Test 6: Large Graph with Large k
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly for a large graph with a large value of \( k \).

**Input**:
```
3
8 32
```

**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Explanation**: For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 32 \), we can assign \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 2 \), \( a_3 = 3 \), \( a_4 = 4 \), \( a_5 = 5 \), \( a_6 = 6 \), \( a_7 = 7 \), and \( a_8 = 8 \). Since \( k = 32 \), all pairs \((i, j)\) satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le 32 \), so the entire graph forms a single clique.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios from small to large graphs and from small to large values of \( k \), ensuring the solution's robustness and correctness.
