# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: There is only one container with zero water, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 3
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
YES
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the first sub-case, it is impossible to make both containers have the same amount of water since the difference between the amounts is 2.
- For the second sub-case, all containers already have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 15, and dividing by 5 gives 3. We can perform operations to make all containers have 3 units of water.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 6, and dividing by 3 gives 2. We can perform operations to make all containers have 2 units of water.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, and dividing by 7 gives 4. However, it is impossible to make all containers have exactly 4 units of water due to the distribution of water.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 28, and dividing by 7 gives 4. Similar to the previous case, it is impossible to make all containers have exactly 4 units of water due to the distribution of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers already have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers have zero water, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Both containers have zero water, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 1000000000, and dividing by 2 gives 500000000. However, it is impossible to make both containers have exactly 500000000 units of water due to the distribution of water.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 1000000000, and dividing by 5 gives 200000000. However, it is impossible to make all containers have exactly 200000000 units of water due to the distribution of water.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers already have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: All containers have zero water, so it is trivially possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 55, and dividing by 10 gives 5.5, which is not an integer, making it impossible to distribute the water evenly.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: The total amount of water is 11, and dividing by 10 gives 1.1, which is not an integer, making it impossible to distribute the water evenly.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

**Output**: 
```
YES
