# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile and book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 pages.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
2 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 1 from the second pile. However, the correct strategy is to put books 3 and 4 in the first pile and books 1 and 2 in the second pile, so she reads 3 + 1 = 4 pages.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 2 3 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put books with numbers 3 and 5 in the first pile, and books 1, 2, and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 2 from the second pile. The correct strategy is to put books 3 and 4 in the first pile and books 1, 2, and 5 in the second pile, so she reads 3 + 2 = 5 pages.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
13
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile and book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 10 + 3 = 13 pages.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and book number 1 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 1 from the second pile. The correct strategy is to put books 2 and 3 in the first pile and book 1 in the second pile, so she reads 3 + 2 = 5 pages.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
3
1 1 1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: In both cases, since all books have the same number of pages, the optimal strategy is to divide them such that the sum of the highest pages in each pile is maximized. For the first case, the highest page count in each pile is 1, and for the second case, it is 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000
```
*Explanation*: Since all books have the same number of pages, the optimal division is to split them evenly, resulting in the sum of the highest pages in each pile being 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000001
```
*Explanation*: The optimal division here is to put the largest books in one pile and the smallest ones in the other. This results in the sum of the highest pages in each pile being 1000000000 + 1000000000 + 1 + 1 = 2000000001.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
19
```
*Explanation*: The optimal division is to put the first five books in one pile and the last five books in the other. This results in the sum of the highest pages in each pile being 5 + 10 = 15, but the correct division is 5 + 14 = 19.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
19
```
*Explanation*: The optimal division is to put the first five books in one pile and the last five books in the other. This results in the sum of the highest pages in each pile being 10 + 9 = 19.
