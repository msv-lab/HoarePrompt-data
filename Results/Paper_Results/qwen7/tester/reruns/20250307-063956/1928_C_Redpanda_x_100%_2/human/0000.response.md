# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 2. The possible values of k are 2, 3, 5, and 6.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 3 and the number he received is 1. The only possible value of k is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
76 4
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 76 and the number he received is 4. The possible values of k are from 2 to 10 (since \(76 \div (2k-2) = 38\) and \(k \leq 10\)).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 100 and the number he received is 99. Since the maximum value of k that fits \(100 \div (2k-2)\) is 50, and 99 is not a valid number in any settling pattern for \(k \leq 50\), there are no valid k.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 500000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 1,000,000,000 and the number he received is 500,000,000. The only possible value of k is 2 because \(1,000,000,000 \div (2k-2) = 500,000,000\) and the number 500,000,000 appears exactly once in the repeating sequence of length \(2k-2\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
1 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, Vasya's position is 1 and the number he received is 1. Since \(k > 1\) is required, there are no valid k.
- For the second test case, Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 2. The only possible value of k is 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
2 1
4 2
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, Vasya's position is 2 and the number he received is 1. The only possible value of k is 2.
- For the second test case, Vasya's position is 4 and the number he received is 2. The possible values of k are 2 and 3.
- For the third test case, Vasya's position is 6 and the number he received is 3. The possible values of k are 2, 3, and 4.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 1. Since the maximum value of k that fits \(10 \div (2k-2)\) is 3, and 1 appears twice in the repeating sequence of length \(2k-2\), there are no valid k.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 3. The possible values of k are 4 and 5.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 4
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Vasya's position is 10 and the number he received is 4. The only possible value of k is 5.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution's robustness and reliability.
