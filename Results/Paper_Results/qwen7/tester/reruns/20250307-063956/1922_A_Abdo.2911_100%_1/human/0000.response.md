# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "C" satisfies the condition since 'a' and 'b' do not match 'C', but 'c' does match 'C'.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
aa
bb
aa
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can satisfy the condition since 'aa' and 'bb' both match any template where both positions are either lowercase or uppercase, but 'aa' always matches regardless of the template.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
10
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "MATHFORCES" satisfies the condition since 'mathforces' and 'luckforces' match, but 'adhoccoder' does not match due to the presence of 'a' instead of 'M'.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
acc
abd
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```

2
1
a
a
a
2

ab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
YES
```
**Explanation**: 
- For the first test case, there is no template that can distinguish between 'a' and 'a'.
- For the second test case, the template "AB" satisfies the condition since 'ab' and 'ba' match, but 'ab' matches regardless of the template.

# Test 6

```
1
1
a
a
b
```
**Output**: 
```
YES

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
aa
aa
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can satisfy the condition since 'aa' and 'aa' both match any template, but 'ab' does not match any template that would make 'aa' match.

# Test 10

1
2
ab
ba
ab
```
**Output**: 
```

```
1
2
ab
ba
cd
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can satisfy the condition since 'ab' and 'ba' both match any template, but 'cd' does not match any template that would make 'ab' or 'ba' not match.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1
a
b
d
