**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 5
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the maximum allowable final position is the same as the total number of people.

**Input**: 
```
1
4 4
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```

# Test 6

**Input**: 
```
1
4 3
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```

# Test 7
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cost to move to the next person is zero.

**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 8
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cost to move to the next person is very high.

**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
3000000000
```

# Test 9
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cost to move to the next person is very low.

**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 10
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cost to move to the next person is non-uniform and Kirill needs to move through many intermediate positions.

**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 10 100 1000 10000 100000
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
111111
```

# Test 11
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cost to move to the next person is non-uniform and Kirill needs to move through many intermediate positions with higher costs.

**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
100000 10000 1000 100 10 1
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
101111
```

# Test 12
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cost to move to the next person is non-uniform and Kirill needs to move through many intermediate positions with varying costs.

**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 10 100 1 10 1000
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
111111
```

# Test 13
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the cost to move to the next person is non-uniform and Kirill needs to move through many intermediate positions with higher costs and varying costs.

**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
100000 10000 1 1000 10 100
1 1 1 1 1 1
