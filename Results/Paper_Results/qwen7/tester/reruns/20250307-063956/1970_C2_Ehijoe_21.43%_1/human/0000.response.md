To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### 1. Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Tree with One Round
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a simple tree structure and one round.

**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree has 5 nodes, and there is only one round. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

#### Test 2: Simple Tree with Two Rounds
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a simple tree structure and two rounds.

**Input**:
```
5 2
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: In the first round, starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins. In the second round, starting from node 2, Hermione can move the stone to node 1, and Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins.

#### Test 3: Tree with More Nodes and One Round
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly with a more complex tree structure and one round.

**Input**:
```
6 1
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree has 6 nodes, and there is only one round. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

### 2. Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4: Single Node Tree
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a single-node tree correctly.

**Input**:
```
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree has only one node, and there is one round. Since there are no other nodes to move to, Ron wins immediately.

#### Test 5: Tree with All Nodes Connected in a Line
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a linear tree structure correctly.

**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree forms a line, and there is only one round. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

#### Test 6: Tree with All Nodes Connected in a Ring
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a circular tree structure correctly.

**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree forms a ring, and there is only one round. Starting from node 5, Ron can move the stone to node 1, and then Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

#### Test 7: Tree with Multiple Rounds
**Objective**: Verify the function handles multiple rounds correctly.

**Input**:
```
5 2
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: In the first round, starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins. In the second round, starting from node 2, Hermione can move the stone to node 1, and Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins.

#### Test 8: Tree with Many Nodes and Multiple Rounds
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a large tree structure with multiple rounds correctly.

**Input**:
```
10 3
1 2
1 3
2 4
2 5
3 6
3 7
6 8
6 9
7 10
1
2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```
**Explanation**: The tree has 10 nodes, and there are three rounds. Starting from node 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins. In the second round, starting from node 2, Hermione can move the stone to node 1, and Ron cannot make a move, so Hermione wins. In the third round, starting from node 3, Ron can move the stone to node 4, and then Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

These test cases cover a range of scenarios, from simple to complex, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
