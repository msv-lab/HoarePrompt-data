14
```
**Explanation**: This test case covers the basic functionality of the problem description. It includes a small number of cities and queries, allowing us to verify the core logic of finding the closest city and calculating the minimum cost.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
0 10
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where there are only two cities. The closest city to each city is itself, and the cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 100 200
1
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the situation where the cities are far apart. The closest city to the middle city is the nearest neighbor, and traveling to the closest city incurs a cost of 1 coin.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
0 5 10 15 20 25
3
1 6
2 5
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
4
4
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of cities is even. It verifies that the closest city is correctly identified and that the cost calculation is accurate.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
7
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
3
1 7
2 6
3 5
```
**Output**: 
```
6
5
4
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the cities are densely packed. It ensures that the closest city is correctly identified even when the cities are close together.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
5
1 10
2 9
3 8
4 7
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
9
8
7
6
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario with a larger number of cities. It ensures that the closest city is correctly identified and that the cost calculation is accurate for various pairs of cities.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000001
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the cities are very close to each other but still distinct. It ensures that the cost to travel to the closest city is correctly calculated.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1
0
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of cities is less than the required minimum. It ensures that the program handles invalid input gracefully.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45
5
1 10
2 9
3 8
4 7
5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
9
8
7
6
5
```
**Explanation**: This test case evaluates the scenario where the cities are not evenly spaced. It ensures that the closest city is correctly identified and that the cost calculation is accurate for various pairs of cities.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1000000000 2000000000
1
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the scenario where the cities are at the extreme ends of the range. It ensures that the cost calculation is correct even when the cities are far apart.
