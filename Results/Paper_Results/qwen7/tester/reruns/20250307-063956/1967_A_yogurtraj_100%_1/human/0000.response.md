1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 10 cards of any type. Since there is only one type of card initially, we can buy 10 more cards of type 1. The resulting array will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, which has 10 subarrays consisting of a permutation of `[1]`.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 4 cards of any type. We can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2. Rearranging the cards as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` results in 8 subarrays equal to `[1, 2]` and 7 subarrays equal to `[2, 1]`, totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2]`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 4 cards of any type. We can buy 0 cards of type 1, 4 cards of type 2, and 0 cards of type 3. Rearranging the cards as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]` results in 6 subarrays equal to `[1, 2]`, 4 subarrays equal to `[2, 1]`, and 5 subarrays equal to `[3, 3]`, totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9

```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 9 cards of any type. We can buy 2 cards of type 1, 6 cards of type 2, and 1 card of type 3. Rearranging the cards as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` results in 7 subarrays equal to `[1, 2]`, 6 subarrays equal to `[2, 1]`, 6 subarrays equal to `[3, 3]`, and 5 subarrays equal to `[1, 3]` and `[3, 1]`, totaling 22 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 3 cards of any type. We can buy 1 card of type 1, 2 cards of type 2, and 0 cards of type 3, 4, and 5. Rearranging the cards as `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` results in 6 subarrays equal to `[1, 2]`, 2 subarrays equal to `[2, 1]`, 2 subarrays equal to `[3, 4]`, 2 subarrays equal to `[4, 3]`, and 16 subarrays equal to `[5, 5]`, totaling 28 subarrays which are permutations of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

*Explanation*: We can buy up to 7 cards of any type. We can buy 0 cards of type 1, 0 cards of type 2, 1 card of type 3, 0 cards of type 4, 1 card of type 5, 2 cards of type 6, 2 cards of type 7, and 1 card of type 8. Rearranging the cards as `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7,
