To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small input size.
**Input**:
```
3
1
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There is only one pair (2, 3), so the optimal choice is to pick the smaller one, resulting in a score of 2.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with an even distribution of numbers.
**Input**:
```
2
2
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The pairs (1, 1) and (2, 2) can be chosen, each contributing 1 to the score, resulting in a total score of 2.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a mix of small and large numbers.
**Input**:
```
3
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
9
```
**Explanation**: The optimal pairs to choose are (1, 2), (3, 4), and (5, 6), contributing scores of 1, 3, and 5 respectively, totaling 9.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with all numbers being the same.
**Input**:
```
3
2
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Each pair (1, 1) contributes 1 to the score, resulting in a total score of 2.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with a larger input size.
**Input**:
```
3
5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
25
```
**Explanation**: The optimal pairs to choose are (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), and (9, 10), contributing scores of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 respectively, totaling 25.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum possible input size.
**Input**:
```
1
1
2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: This is the same as Test 1 but with a single test case.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with all numbers being the same and the maximum possible value.
**Input**:
```
1
5
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**:
```
25000000
```
**Explanation**: Each pair (10000000, 10000000) contributes 10000000 to the score, resulting in a total score of 25000000.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large number of elements where half are the same and the other half are different.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The optimal pairs to choose are (1, 1), (2, 2), and (3, 3), contributing scores of 1, 2, and 3 respectively, totaling 5.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large number of elements where all numbers are unique and sorted.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
25
```
**Explanation**: The optimal pairs to choose are (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), and (9, 10), contributing scores of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 respectively, totaling 25.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a large number of elements where all numbers are unique and unsorted.
**Input**:
```
1
5
10 5 3 8 2 6 4 9 1 7
```
**Output**:
```
25
```
**Explanation**: Sorting the array first would yield the same result as in Test 9, so the optimal pairs are still (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8), and (9, 10), contributing scores of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 respectively, totaling 25.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
