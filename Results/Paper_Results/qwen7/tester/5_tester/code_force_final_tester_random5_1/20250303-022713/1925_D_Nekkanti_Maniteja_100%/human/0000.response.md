# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Explanation**: There is only one pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in the sum of 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 25
```
**Output**: 
```
175
```
**Explanation**: There is one pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 25. The friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion. For 2 excursions, the sum is 25 + 26 = 51. Since there are two excursions, the total sum is 51 * 2 = 102, but we need to consider the expected value, which is 51 + 51 = 102 / 2 = 51. However, since the problem asks for the expected value of the sum, we calculate it as 25 + 26 = 51 for both excursions, resulting in 102.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
777777784
```
**Explanation**: There are two pairs of friends: (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 25 and (3, 2) with an initial friendship value of 24. The friendship value of (1, 2) increases by 1 for each excursion, and the same for (3, 2). For 4 excursions, the expected sum is calculated as follows:
- Excursion 1: 25 + 24 = 49
- Excursion 2: 26 + 25 = 51
- Excursion 3: 27 + 26 = 53
- Excursion 4: 28 + 27 = 55

The total sum is (49 + 51 + 53 + 55) / 4 = 208 / 4 = 52. However, considering the expected value, the sum is 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 208. The result is 208 % (10^9 + 7) = 777777784.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001
```
**Explanation**: There is one pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1000000000. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in the sum of 1000000000 + 1000000001 = 2000000001. Since there is only one excursion, the output is 2000000001 % (10^9 + 7) = 1000000001.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: There are three pairs of friends: (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair is chosen once, so the sum is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 2
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Explanation**: There are five pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair is chosen twice, so the sum is (1 + 2) + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2) + (1 + 2) = 10. The expected value is 10 / 2 = 5, but since we need the sum, the output is 10.

# Test 8

```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Explanation**: There are nine pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair is chosen three times, so the sum is (1 + 2 + 3) + (1 + 2 + 3) + ... + (1 + 2 + 3) = 9 * 6 = 54. The expected value is 54 / 3 = 18, but since we need the sum, the output is 54.

```
**Explanation**: There are ten pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair is chosen once, so the sum is 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 10. The expected value is 10 / 1 = 10, but since we need the sum, the output is 10.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.
