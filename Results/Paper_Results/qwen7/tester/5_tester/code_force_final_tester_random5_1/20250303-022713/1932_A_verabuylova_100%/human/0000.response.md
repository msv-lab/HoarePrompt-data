To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Hereâ€™s a detailed set of test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
10
.@@*@.**@@
5
.@@@@
15
.@@..@***..@@@*
```
**Output**:
```
3
4
3
```

#### Explanation:
- For the first test case, the path is `.@@*@.**@@`. Starting from the leftmost cell, you can collect 3 coins by moving to the second, fourth, and seventh cells.
- For the second test case, the path is `.@@@@`. Since all cells have coins, you can collect 4 coins by moving to every cell.
- For the third test case, the path is `.@@..@***..@@@*`. Starting from the leftmost cell, you can collect 3 coins by moving to the second, fifth, and tenth cells.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
.
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
- The path has only one cell, and it is empty. Therefore, no coins can be collected.

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1
@
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Explanation:
- The path has only one cell, and it contains a coin. Therefore, you can collect 1 coin.

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2
.@
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Explanation:
- The path has two cells, and the second cell contains a coin. By moving to the second cell, you can collect 1 coin.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
.@.
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Explanation:
- The path has three cells, and the second cell contains a coin. By moving to the second cell, you can collect 1 coin.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10
*.*.*.*.*.*
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
- The path consists entirely of thorns. Therefore, no coins can be collected.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
10
..........
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
- The path consists entirely of empty cells. Therefore, no coins can be collected.

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10
.@.@.@.@.@
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

#### Explanation:
- The path alternates between empty cells and cells containing coins. By moving to every other cell starting from the second cell, you can collect 5 coins.

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10
*.*.*.*.@.
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Explanation:
- The path starts with thorns and ends with a coin. By moving to the last cell, you can collect 1 coin.

#### Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10
.@.*.*.*.*
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Explanation:
- The path starts with a coin and is followed by thorns. By moving to the first cell, you can collect 1 coin.

#### Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10
.*.*.*.*.@
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Explanation:
- The path ends with a coin and is preceded by thorns. By moving to the last cell, you can collect 1 coin.

#### Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
10
.*.*.*.*.*
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Explanation:
- The path consists of alternating thorns and empty cells. No coins can be collected.

### Summary
These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring that the solution handles both typical and edge cases effectively.
