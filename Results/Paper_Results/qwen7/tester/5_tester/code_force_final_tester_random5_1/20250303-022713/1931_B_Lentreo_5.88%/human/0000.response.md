# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: A single container always has the same amount of water, so the answer is "YES".

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Comment**: A single container with zero water also satisfies the condition.
**Output**: 
```
YES
```

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: Two containers with different amounts of water cannot be made equal.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 3, and we can redistribute the water to make all containers have 3 units of water.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 2, and we can redistribute the water to make all containers have 2 units of water.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 4, but the presence of a zero makes it impossible to redistribute the water evenly without violating the condition \(i < j\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: Similar to Test 6, the presence of a non-zero value that cannot be poured into a lower-indexed container to balance out the zero makes it impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
0
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: A large number of containers with zero water can still satisfy the condition.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: Two containers with the same amount of water already satisfy the condition.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1000000000 0 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: One container with zero water cannot be used to balance the other two containers.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 3, but the difference between the maximum and minimum values is too large to redistribute the water evenly.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: All containers already have the same amount of water.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 5.5, but the difference between the maximum and minimum values is too large to redistribute the water evenly.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 1.1, and we can redistribute the water to make all containers have 1 unit of water except one having 2 units.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 1.2, and we can redistribute the water to make all containers have 1 unit of water except two having 2 units.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Comment**: The average amount of water per container is 1.3, but the difference between the maximum and minimum values is too large to redistribute the water evenly.
