# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 2\), the simplest array that has exactly 2 increasing subsequences is \([0]\). The only increasing subsequences are \(\emptyset\) and \([0]\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 5\), the array \([0, 1, 0]\) has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), \([0, 1]\), and \([0, 0]\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 13\), the array \([2, 2, 3, 4, 2]\) has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The subsequences are \(\emptyset\), \([2]\), \([2]\), \([3]\), \([4]\), \([2, 2]\), \([2, 3]\), \([2, 4]\), \([2, 2, 3]\), \([2, 2, 4]\), \([2, 3, 4]\), \([2, 2, 3, 4]\), and \([2, 2, 4, 2]\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 37\), the array \([-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]\) has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The specific construction of this array is more complex, but it ensures the exact count of 37 increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 1\), there is no valid array because the only increasing subsequence of any non-empty array is the array itself, which means \(X\) must be greater than 1.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 10^{18}\), it is impossible to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \(10^{18}\) increasing subsequences. The maximum number of increasing subsequences for an array of length 200 is much smaller than \(10^{18}\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 3\), the array \([0, 1]\) has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), and \([0, 1]\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 0
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 4\), the array \([0, 0]\) has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([0]\), and \([0, 0]\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 6\), the array \([0, 1, 2]\) has exactly 6 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), \([2]\), \([0, 1]\), and \([0, 1, 2]\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
4
0 1 2 0
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 10\), the array \([0, 1, 2, 0]\) has exactly 10 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), \([2]\), \([0, 1]\), \([0, 2]\), \([0, 1, 2]\), \([0, 0]\), \([0, 1, 0]\), and \([0, 1, 2, 0]\).

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles various input sizes and values effectively.
