# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the friendship value for all excursions is 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in a total sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: For the first excursion, the expected value of the friendship value is 1. For the second excursion, the expected value is also 1, making the total sum 1 + 1 = 2.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
*Explanation*: The final answer is \(\frac{7}{9} \mod (10^9+7)\), which is 40000020.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for the single excursion, hence the friendship value for the excursion is 0.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: There are three pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{3}\), and since there is only one excursion, the total sum is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 6 2
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
1 3 1
2 4 1
1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
*Explanation*: There are six pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{6}\), and since there are two excursions, the total sum is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\) for the first excursion, and \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\) for the second excursion, but we need to account for the fact that some pairs might be chosen more than once. The correct calculation is \(\frac{6}{6} + \frac{6}{6} = 2 + 2 = 4\), but considering the actual probability and the fact that each pair is chosen independently, the total sum is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 100000
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
500005000
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in a total sum of \(1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 100000 = \frac{100000 \times 100001}{2} = 500005000\).

# Test 9

8 9 1
9 10 1
10 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: There are 10 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{10}\), and since there are 10 excursions, the total sum is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

# Test 10

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: There are 9 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{9}\), and since there is only one excursion, the total sum is \(1\).

# Test 11

```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
*Explanation*: There are 10 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{10}\), and since there are 10 excursions, the total sum is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

**Output**: 
```
500005000
```
*Explanation*: There are 10 pairs of friends, each with an initial friendship value of 1. The expected value for each pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{10}\), and since there are 100 excursions, the total sum is \(100 \times 500005 = 500005000\).
