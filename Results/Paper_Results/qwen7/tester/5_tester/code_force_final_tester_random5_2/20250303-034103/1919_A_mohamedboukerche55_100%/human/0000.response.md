# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
*Explanation*: Alice cannot make a move after removing a coin from her wallet, thus Bob wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
*Explanation*: Alice can swap wallets and remove a coin from Bob's wallet, leaving Bob with 3 coins. Bob then removes a coin and Alice can swap back, leaving Bob with 2 coins. This continues until Bob is left with 0 coins, and Alice wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
*Explanation*: Alice cannot force Bob into a losing position directly. After several exchanges, Bob can always respond in such a way that he avoids being the one to run out of coins first.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
*Explanation*: Alice can swap wallets and remove a coin from Bob's wallet, leaving Bob with 4 coins. Alice can then remove a coin from her wallet and swap back, leaving Bob with 3 coins. This continues until Bob is left with 0 coins, and Alice wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
11 9
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
*Explanation*: Similar to previous edge cases, Alice cannot force Bob into a losing position directly. After several exchanges, Bob can always respond in such a way that he avoids being the one to run out of coins first.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
83 91
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
*Explanation*: The difference between the number of coins is significant, but Bob can still force Alice into a position where she runs out of coins first.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1032 9307
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
*Explanation*: Alice can strategically swap and remove coins to force Bob into a position where he runs out of coins first.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
839204 7281
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
*Explanation*: Alice can strategically swap and remove coins to force Bob into a position where he runs out of coins first.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
*Explanation*: Both players have the same number of coins initially. Since they play optimally, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he never runs out of coins first.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
53110 2024
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
*Explanation*: The difference between the number of coins is significant, but Bob can still force Alice into a position where she runs out of coins first.

These test cases cover a range of basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
