# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks will form a degenerate triangle since all sticks have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is calculated as \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The valid combinations to form a triangle are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, and we need to choose exactly 3 sticks, which is impossible.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
6
0 1 2 3 4 5
3
0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a triangle is calculated as follows: \( \binom{6}{3} - 6 = 20 \) (total ways minus invalid degenerate triangles). For the second test case, there are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2\), and no combination can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
8
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
56
```
**Explanation**: All 8 sticks have the same length \(2^0\). The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 8 is \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 2 sticks with the same length \(2^2\), and we need to choose exactly 3 sticks, which is impossible.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 5 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\). No combination of these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4
1 1 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^1, 2^2, 2^2\). The valid combinations to form a triangle are (1, 1, 2) and (1, 2, 2) repeated twice due to the repetition of lengths.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^1\). The valid combination to form a triangle is (0, 1, 1).
