# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 7
```
**Output**: 
```
3 2 2
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 3, 2, and 2 sum to 7, and their bitwise OR (3 | 2 | 2) is 7, which has three 1s in its binary representation. This is the maximum possible number of 1s for three numbers that sum to 7.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4 8
```
**Output**: 
```
4 4 0 0
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 4, 4, 0, and 0 sum to 8, and their bitwise OR (4 | 4 | 0 | 0) is 4, which has one 1 in its binary representation. However, since we aim to maximize the number of 1s, we can use 4, 4, 0, and 0 to get the maximum number of 1s possible for four numbers that sum to 8.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 1 and 1 sum to 2, and their bitwise OR (1 | 1) is 1, which has one 1 in its binary representation. This is the maximum possible number of 1s for two numbers that sum to 2.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
8 1 1
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 8, 1, and 1 sum to 10, and their bitwise OR (8 | 1 | 1) is 9, which has four 1s in its binary representation. This is the maximum possible number of 1s for three numbers that sum to 10.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: There is only one number to be printed, and it must equal 10.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 10
```
**Output**: 
```
8 2
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 8 and 2 sum to 10, and their bitwise OR (8 | 2) is 10, which has four 1s in its binary representation. This is the maximum possible number of 1s for two numbers that sum to 10.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 15
```
**Output**: 
```
8 7
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 8 and 7 sum to 15, and their bitwise OR (8 | 7) is 15, which has four 1s in its binary representation. This is the maximum possible number of 1s for two numbers that sum to 15.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 16
```
**Output**: 
```
16 0
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 16 and 0 sum to 16, and their bitwise OR (16 | 0) is 16, which has one 1 in its binary representation. However, using 16 and 0 allows us to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR result.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3 16
```
**Output**: 
```
8 8 0
```
*Explanation*: The numbers 8, 8, and 0 sum to 16, and their bitwise OR (8 | 8 | 0) is 8, which has one 1 in its binary representation. Using 8, 8, and 0 allows us to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR result.
