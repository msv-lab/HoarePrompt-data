# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is \(2 - 1 = 1\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes the 1-st item for free and pays for the 2-nd and 3-rd items. Alice's profit is \((3 + 2 + 2) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes 2 items for free. Since Bob will take the 1-st and 2-nd items, Alice's profit is \((4 + 2 + 3) - (2 + 1 + 1) = 0\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```

1 3 4 9 1 3
7 6 8 10 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 4-th, and 6-th items; then Bob takes 2 items for free. Since Bob will take the 1-st and 2-nd items, Alice's profit is \((7 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 3) = 7\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the only item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is \(1 - 1 = 0\). However, since Bob cannot take any items for free, the profit remains \(1 - 1 = 0\).

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy both items; then Bob takes both items for free. Therefore, Alice's profit is \((1 + 2) - (2 + 1) = 0\).

```
**Output**: 
```
1

```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 4-th, and 5-th items; then Bob takes 3 items for free. Since Bob will take the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items, Alice's profit is \((5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) - (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = 1\).

# Test 10

10 20
10 20
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
