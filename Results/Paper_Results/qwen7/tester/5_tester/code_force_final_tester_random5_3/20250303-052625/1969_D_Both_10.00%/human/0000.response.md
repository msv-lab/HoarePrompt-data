# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4 1
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes the 1-st item for free and pays for the 2-nd and 3-rd items. Alice's profit is (3 + 2) - (1 + 2 + 1) = 1. Bob could take the 2-nd item for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
2 1 1 1
4 2 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st and 2-nd items; then Bob takes 2 items for free (the 1-st and 2-nd items). Alice's profit is (4 + 2) - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0. Bob won't take any more items for free since it would decrease his cost.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
1 3 4 9 1 3
7 6 8 10 6 8
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, 5-th, and 6-th items; then Bob takes 2 items for free (the 1-st and 2-nd items). Alice's profit is (7 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 6 + 8) - (1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 3) = 42 - 22 = 20. However, Bob will only take the 1-st and 2-nd items for free, so Alice's profit is (7 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 6 + 8) - (3 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 3) = 42 - 20 = 22 - 15 = 7.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
10
20
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the only item, and Bob cannot take any item for free. Alice's profit is 20 - 10 = 10.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
10 20
20 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy both items; then Bob takes 2 items for free. Alice's profit is (20 + 10) - (10 + 20) = 0.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1

1 2 3
4 5 6
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd items; then Bob takes 1 item for free (the 1-st item). Alice's profit is (4 + 5 + 6) - (1 + 2 + 3) = 15 - 6 = 9. However, Bob will take the 1-st item for free, so Alice's profit is (4 + 5 + 6) - (2 + 3) = 15 - 5 = 10 - 9 = 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
20
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the only item; then Bob takes 1 item for free. Alice's profit is 20 - 10 = 10.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
10 20
20 10
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 1-st and 2-nd items; then Bob takes 1 item for free (the 1-st item). Alice's profit is (20 + 10) - (10 + 20) = 0. However, Bob will take the 1-st item for free, so Alice's profit is (20 + 10) - (20) = 30 - 20 = 10.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0

10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the only item, and Bob cannot take any item for free. Alice's profit is 10 - 10 = 0.

**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 20 - 10 = 10.
