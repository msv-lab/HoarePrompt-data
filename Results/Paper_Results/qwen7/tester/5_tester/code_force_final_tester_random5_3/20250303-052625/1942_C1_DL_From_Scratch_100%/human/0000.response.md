To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test Case 1
**Objective**: Verify the function with a small polygon and a few chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides and 4 chosen vertices (1, 6, 2, 5), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

#### Test Case 2
**Objective**: Verify the function with a larger polygon and more chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
8 8 0
1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Explanation**: With 8 sides and 8 chosen vertices (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 6.

#### Test Case 3
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is equal to the number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides and 2 chosen vertices (1, 3), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test Case 4
**Objective**: Verify the function with the minimum number of sides (4 sides).

**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 4 sides and 2 chosen vertices (1, 3), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

#### Test Case 5
**Objective**: Verify the function with the maximum number of sides (10^9) and a small number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 1,000,000,000 sides and 2 chosen vertices (1, 2), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test Case 6
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just greater than the number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
5 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: With 5 sides and 2 chosen vertices (1, 3), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 2.

#### Test Case 7
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is just less than the number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
3 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 3 sides and 2 chosen vertices (1, 2), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test Case 8
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is exactly twice the number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: With 6 sides and 3 chosen vertices (1, 3, 5), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 3.

#### Test Case 9
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is one more than the number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
5 4 0
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 5 sides and 4 chosen vertices (1, 2, 3, 4), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.

#### Test Case 10
**Objective**: Verify the function with a polygon where the number of sides is one less than the number of chosen vertices.

**Input**:
```
1
3 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: With 3 sides and 2 chosen vertices (1, 2), the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces is 1.
