# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with simple input values.
**Input**: 
```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```
**Output**: 
```
9
4
784
```

# Test 2
**Objective**: Check the case where the square has very small side lengths.
**Input**: 
```
1
-10 10
-10 20
10 10
10 20
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```

# Test 3
**Objective**: Test with a square having negative coordinates.
**Input**: 
```
1
-5 -5
-5 5
5 -5
5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the case where the square is aligned with the axes but the coordinates are at the boundary limits.
**Input**: 
```
1
-1000 1000
-1000 1001
1000 1000
1000 1001
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```

# Test 5
**Objective**: Check the case where the square is very large.
**Input**: 
```
1
-1000 1000
-1000 -1000
1000 1000
1000 -1000
```
**Output**: 
```
8000000
```

# Test 6
**Objective**: Evaluate the case where the square is rotated but still has sides parallel to the axes (this is an edge case since the problem guarantees sides parallel to axes).
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
1 0
0 1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 7
**Objective**: Test with a square where all points are the same (this is an edge case because it technically forms a degenerate square with zero area, but the problem guarantees a positive area).
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
0 0
0 0
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Error: Invalid input, cannot form a square with positive area.
```

# Test 8
**Objective**: Check the case where the coordinates are very close to each other but still form a valid square.
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where the square is formed by points that are symmetric about the origin.
**Input**: 
```
1
-1 -1
1 -1
1 1
-1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```

# Test 10
**Objective**: Test with a square where the coordinates are at the extreme boundaries of the given range.
**Input**: 
```
1
-1000 -1000
-1000 1000
1000 -1000
1000 1000
```
**Output**: 
```
4000000
```
