# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 10^6 \) and \( k = 1000000 \).
**Input**: 
```
1 1000000 1000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000
1 1 1 ... 1 (1000000 times)
```
**Explanation**: We need a sequence where there is no subsequence with a sum of 1000000, but there are subsequences with sums of 1 through 999999. The sequence `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (1000000 times) satisfies these conditions.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 25 \) and \( k = 1 \).
**Input**: 
```
1 25 1
```
**Output**: 
```
25
1 1 1 ... 1 (25 times)
```
**Explanation**: We need a sequence where there is no subsequence with a sum of 1, but there are subsequences with sums of 2 through 25. The sequence `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (25 times) satisfies these conditions.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 25 \) and \( k = 25 \).
**Input**: 
```
1 25 25
```
**Output**: 
```
24
1 1 1 ... 1 (24 times) 24
```
**Explanation**: We need a sequence where there is no subsequence with a sum of 25, but there are subsequences with sums of 1 through 24. The sequence `[1, 1, ..., 1, 24]` (24 times) satisfies these conditions.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when \( n = 25 \) and \( k = 13 \).
**Input**: 
```
1 25 13
```
**Output**: 
```
