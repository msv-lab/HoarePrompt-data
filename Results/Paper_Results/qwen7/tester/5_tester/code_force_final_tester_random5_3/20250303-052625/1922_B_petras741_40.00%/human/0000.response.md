# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
35
```
**Explanation**: There are 7 sticks, and any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle since all sticks have the same length.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: There are 4 sticks with lengths \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). The valid combinations are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are 3 sticks with lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these sticks can form a triangle because the sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There is only one stick, so it's impossible to form a triangle with exactly 3 sticks.

0 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
20
0
```
**Explanation**: For the first test case, there are 6 sticks with lengths \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5\).
