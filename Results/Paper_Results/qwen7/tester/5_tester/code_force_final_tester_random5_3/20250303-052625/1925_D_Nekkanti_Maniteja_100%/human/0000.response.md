# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.*

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in the sum of friendship values from 1 to 10 for 24 excursions.*

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. For the first excursion, the value is 1, and for the second, it is 2, giving a total of 3. Since the excursions are independent, the expected value is the average of these two outcomes, which is 1.5. However, since we need the expected value of the sum, we consider both outcomes equally likely, thus the expected sum is 1 + 2 = 3 for two excursions.*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
*Explanation*: The pairs (1, 2) and (3, 2) have initial friendship values of 25 and 24 respectively. The expected value calculation involves considering the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in their friendship values over the four excursions.*

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1000000000. After the first excursion, the friendship value increases to 1000000001. Thus, the expected value is 1000000001.*

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: There are three pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) each with an initial friendship value of 1. Since each pair is chosen with equal probability, the expected value is the average of the friendship values of all pairs, which is 1 for one excursion.*

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: There are three pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) each with an initial friendship value of 1. Over two excursions, the expected value is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs, which is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 for each pair, giving a total of 6.*

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: There are three pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) each with an initial friendship value of 1. Over three excursions, the expected value is the sum of the friendship values of all pairs, which is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 for each pair, giving a total of 10.*

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There are ten pairs, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair is chosen with equal probability, and after one excursion, the friendship value of each pair increases by 1, resulting in a total sum of 10 for all pairs.*

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 2
1 2 1
2 3 1

6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
110
```
*Explanation*: There are ten pairs, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair is chosen with equal probability, and after two excursions, the friendship value of each pair increases by 2, resulting in a total sum of 20 for all pairs.*

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 3
1 2 1

9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
165
```
*Explanation*: There are ten pairs, each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each pair is chosen with equal probability, and after three excursions, the friendship value of each pair increases by 3, resulting in a total sum of 30 for all pairs.*

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 0 10
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.*
