# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 2, and Sasha concatenates 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 9 to get 9, reverses 56 to get 65, and leaves 1 unchanged. Sasha can only concatenate 9 and 65 to get 965, which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins because Sasha cannot make a valid move after Anna's turn.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 1 to get 1, reverses 2007 to get 7002, reverses 800 to get 800, and reverses 1580 to get 8510. Sasha can concatenate 7002 and 8510 to get 70028510, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Sasha wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 5000 to get 5000, reverses 123 to get 321, reverses 30 to get 30, and reverses 4 to get 4. Sasha can only concatenate 5000 and 321 to get 5000321, which is less than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins because Sasha cannot make a valid move after Anna's turn.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses each number. Sasha can concatenate numbers to form a large number greater than \(10^{10}\). Sasha wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: There is only one number, and Anna cannot make a move. Sasha wins immediately, but since the problem states that players can't skip turns, Anna wins because the game ends with one number left, which is 6, less than \(10^1 = 10\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna cannot make a move, and Sasha wins immediately because 10 is greater than or equal to \(10^1 = 10\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses each number. Sasha can only concatenate smaller numbers, and the largest number formed is still less than \(10^9 = 1000000000\). Anna wins because Sasha cannot make a valid move after Anna's turn.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses each number. Sasha can concatenate any two 10s to form 1010, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Sasha wins.
