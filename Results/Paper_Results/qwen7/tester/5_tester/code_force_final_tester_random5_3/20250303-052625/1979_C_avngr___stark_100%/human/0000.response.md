# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 3, and the multipliers are 3, 2, and 7. The solution provided meets the requirement that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic test case with 2 outcomes and multipliers 3 and 3. The solution provided ensures that the total bet is less than the winnings for either outcome.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case involves 5 outcomes with the same multiplier 5. Since the total bet would be the same for all outcomes, it is impossible to find a distribution that satisfies the condition.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This test case has 6 outcomes with different multipliers. The solution provided ensures that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case involves 3 outcomes with multipliers 6, 3, and 2. Since the total bet would be the same for all outcomes, it is impossible to find a distribution that satisfies the condition.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This test case has 5 outcomes with different multipliers. The solution provided ensures that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
3
3 2 7
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes two separate scenarios. The first scenario is identical to Test 1, and the second scenario is identical to Test 2.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
3
1
10
2
10 10
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1
-1
-1
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes three separate scenarios. The first scenario has only one outcome, so the solution is trivial. The second scenario has two outcomes with the same multiplier, making it impossible to satisfy the condition. The third scenario has five outcomes with the same multiplier, also making it impossible to satisfy the condition.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
4
4
7 9 3 17
3
6 3 2
5
5 5 5 5 5
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 
-1
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes four separate scenarios. The first scenario has 4 outcomes with different multipliers, and a valid solution is provided. The second scenario is identical to Test 5, making it impossible to satisfy the condition. The third scenario is identical to Test 3, making it impossible to satisfy the condition. The fourth scenario has 6 outcomes with different multipliers, and a valid solution is provided.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
5
2
3 3
3
6 3 2
4
7 9 3 17
5
5 5 5 5 5

**Output**: 
```
1 1 
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes five separate scenarios, covering various combinations of outcomes and multipliers. The first scenario is identical to Test 2, and a valid solution is provided. The second scenario is identical to Test 5, making it impossible to satisfy the condition. The third scenario is identical to Test 1, and a valid solution is provided. The fourth scenario is identical to Test 3, making it impossible to satisfy the condition. The fifth scenario is identical to Test 6, and a valid solution is provided.
