# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 2, resulting in 2. Sasha concatenates 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Anna has no valid move after this, so Sasha wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 9 to get 9, 56 to get 65, and 1 to get 1. Sasha can only concatenate 9 and 65 to form 965 or 659, neither of which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 1 to get 1, 2007 to get 7002, 800 to get 800, and 1580 to get 8510. Sasha can concatenate 7002 and 800 to form 7002800 or 8007002, both of which are greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Sasha wins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 5000 to get 5000, 123 to get 321, 30 to get 30, and 4 to get 4. Sasha can only concatenate 5000 and 321 to form 5000321 or 3215000, neither of which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses all numbers. Sasha can concatenate 6 and 4 to form 64, 6 and 2 to form 62, etc. Eventually, Sasha can form a number greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Sasha wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: There is only one number, 6, which is less than \(10^1 = 10\). Anna wins immediately.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: The single number 10 is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Sasha wins immediately.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 9
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses all numbers. Sasha can only concatenate 1 and 2 to form 12, 9 and 10 to form 910, etc. None of the resulting numbers are greater than \(10^9 = 1000000000\). Anna wins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses all numbers. Sasha can concatenate 10 and 10 to form 1010, 10 and 10 again to form 1010, etc. Eventually, Sasha can form a number greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Sasha wins.

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles all given constraints and edge cases effectively.
