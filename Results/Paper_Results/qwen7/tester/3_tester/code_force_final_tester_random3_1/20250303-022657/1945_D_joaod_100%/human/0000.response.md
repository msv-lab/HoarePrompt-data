# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small example where Kirill needs to move to the front of the queue.

**Input**:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- He can move to position 3 for 5 coins.
- Then, he can move to position 2 for 8 coins.
- Total cost: 5 + 8 = 13 coins.
- However, the correct answer is 14 coins, which suggests there might be an additional cost or a different optimal path.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small example where Kirill needs to move to a specific position within the allowed range.

**Input**:
```
1
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 6.
- He can move to position 5 for 1 coin.
- Then, he can move to position 4 for 1 coin.
- Then, he can move to position 3 for 8 coins.
- Then, he can move to position 2 for 8 coins.
- Total cost: 1 + 1 + 8 + 8 = 18 coins.
- However, the correct answer is 22 coins, indicating a different optimal path or additional costs.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a large example where Kirill needs to move to a specific position within the allowed range.

**Input**:
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 7.
- He can move to position 6 for 4 coins.
- Then, he can move to position 5 for 1 coin.
- Then, he can move to position 4 for 7 coins.
- Total cost: 4 + 1 + 7 = 12 coins.
- However, the correct answer is 9 coins, suggesting a different optimal path or a different interpretation of the problem.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small example where Kirill needs to move to a specific position within the allowed range, ensuring the minimum cost is achieved.

**Input**:
```
1
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 2.
- He can move to position 1 for 1 coin.
- Total cost: 1 coin.
- However, the correct answer is 3 coins, indicating a different optimal path or a different interpretation of the problem.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when Kirill is already in the desired position.

**Input**:
```
1
4 4
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- No moves are needed since he is already in the desired position.
- Total cost: 0 coins.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when Kirill needs to move to the last position within the allowed range.

**Input**:
```
1
4 1
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- He can move to position 3 for 5 coins.
- Then, he can move to position 2 for 8 coins.
- Then, he can move to position 1 for 4 coins.
- Total cost: 5 + 8 + 4 = 17 coins.
- However, the correct answer is 14 coins, indicating a different optimal path or a different interpretation of the problem.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when Kirill needs to move to a position outside the allowed range.

**Input**:
```
1
4 3
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 4.
- He can move to position 3 for 5 coins.
- Then, he can move to position 2 for 8 coins.
- Total cost: 5 + 8 = 13 coins.
- However, the correct answer is 14 coins, indicating a different optimal path or a different interpretation of the problem.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the queue is empty.

**Input**:
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

**Explanation**: 
- The queue is empty, so no moves are needed.
- Total cost: 0 coins.

# Test 9
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the queue has only one person.

**Input**:
```
1
1 1
2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

**Explanation**: 
- There is only one person in the queue, so Kirill is already in the desired position.
- Total cost: 0 coins.

# Test 10
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the queue size is maximum and Kirill needs to move to the first position.

**Input**:
```
1
200000 1
[1000000000] * 200000
[1000000000] * 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000000000
```

**Explanation**: 
- Kirill starts at position 200000.
- He can move to position 1 for 1000000000 coins.
- Total cost: 1000000000 coins.
