# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
*Explanation*: We can buy up to 10 cards of any type, and since there is only one type of card initially, we can buy 10 cards of type 1. The final array will be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which has 10 subarrays consisting of a permutation of [1].*

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2. Rearranging the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] results in 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays equal to [2, 1], totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2].*

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: We can buy 4 cards of type 2. Rearranging the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] results in 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays equal to [2, 1], totaling 15 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2].*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
7 6 2
```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
*Explanation*: We can buy 6 cards of type 1 and 2 cards of type 3. Rearranging the cards as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] results in 14 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 14 subarrays equal to [2, 1], totaling 28 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2].*

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
6 6 7 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
*Explanation*: We can buy 3 cards of type 3. Rearranging the cards as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4] results in 11 subarrays equal to [1, 2, 3, 4] and 11 subarrays equal to [4, 3, 2, 1], totaling 22 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4].*

# Test 6
**Input**:

1
9 7
7 6 1 7 6 2 4 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
32
```
*Explanation*: We can buy 7 cards of type 1. Rearranging the cards as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] results in 16 subarrays equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and 16 subarrays equal to [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], totaling 32 subarrays which are permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].*

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
1 3 1 2 1 9 3 5 7 5
```
**Output**: 
```
28
