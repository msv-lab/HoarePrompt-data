# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a simple, balanced set of problems.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1 1
5 10 15 20 26
11
16
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Explanation**: The original set of problems has an imbalance of 5 (26 - 20). Adding the new problem with complexity 16 + 11 = 27 will increase the imbalance to 11, which is the minimum possible imbalance after adding one problem.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Check the case where the new problem can be added to reduce the imbalance.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1 1
5 10 15 20 26
10
16
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The original set of problems has an imbalance of 5 (26 - 20). Adding the new problem with complexity 10 + 16 = 26 will reduce the imbalance to 5, which is the minimum possible imbalance after adding one problem.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the case where the new problem can be added to reduce the imbalance further.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1 1

16
```

```
5
```
**Explanation**: The original set of problems has an imbalance of 5 (26 - 20). Adding the new problem with complexity 15 + 16 = 31 will increase the imbalance to 11, but we can also add 15 + 1 = 16, which reduces the imbalance to 5, the minimum possible imbalance after adding one problem.
