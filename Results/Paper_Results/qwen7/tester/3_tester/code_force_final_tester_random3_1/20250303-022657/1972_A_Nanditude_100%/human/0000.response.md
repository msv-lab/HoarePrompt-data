```
**Explanation**: 
- The initial arrays are `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]` and `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`.
- After proposing a problem with difficulty 800, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`.
- After proposing a problem with difficulty 1800, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000]`.

```
**Explanation**: 
- The initial arrays are `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

1000
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The initial arrays are `a = [1000]` and `b = [1000]`.
- Since `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`, no new problems need to be proposed.
