# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
101
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: If the road is laid after the first house, only 0 out of 1 resident on the left side is satisfied. Laying the road after the second house satisfies 1 out of 2 residents on the left and 1 out of 1 resident on the right, making it the optimal solution.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```

010111
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Laying the road after the third house satisfies 2 out of 3 residents on the left and 2 out of 3 residents on the right, which is the optimal solution.

**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Laying the road after the second house satisfies 1 out of 2 residents on the left and 2 out of 3 residents on the right, making it the optimal solution.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
000
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: Since all residents prefer the left side, the road can be laid after the third house, satisfying all residents.

1
```
*Explanation*: Laying the road after the first house satisfies 1 out of 1 resident on the left and 1 out of 2 residents on the right, making it the optimal solution.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3
001
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: Since the road can be laid before the first house, all residents on the left side are satisfied, making it the optimal solution.
