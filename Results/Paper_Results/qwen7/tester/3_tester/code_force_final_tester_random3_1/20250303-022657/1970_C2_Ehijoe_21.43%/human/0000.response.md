To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. We'll focus on different tree structures, starting nodes, and validate the logic for determining the winner based on optimal play.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Simple Tree with One Starting Node
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a simple tree structure and a single starting node.

**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```

#### Test 2: Simple Tree with Multiple Starting Nodes
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a simple tree structure and multiple starting nodes.

**Input**:
```
5 2
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
Ron
```

#### Test 3: Star Tree Structure
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a star tree structure (one central node connected to all others).

**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```

#### Test 4: Linear Tree Structure

**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5: Single Node Tree
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a tree with a single node.

**Input**:
```
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```

#### Test 6: Tree with All Nodes Connected in a Ring
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a tree where all nodes form a ring.

**Input**:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```

#### Test 7: Tree with a Node Having Only One Neighbor
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a tree where a node has only one neighbor.

**Input**:
```
3 1
1 2
2 3
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```

#### Test 8: Tree with Multiple Starting Nodes and Different Structures
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a combination of different tree structures and multiple starting nodes.

**Input**:
```
6 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
Ron
```

#### Test 9: Tree with a Complex Structure
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a complex tree structure.

**Input**:
```
7 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
1
```
**Output**:
```
Ron
```

### Additional Notes

- For each test case, the input format is consistent with the problem description.
- The output is expected to be "Ron" or "Hermione" based on the optimal play strategy.
- The test cases cover a variety of tree structures and starting nodes to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
