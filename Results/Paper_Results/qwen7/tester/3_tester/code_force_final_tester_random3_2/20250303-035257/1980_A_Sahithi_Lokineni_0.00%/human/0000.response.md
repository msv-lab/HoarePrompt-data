6 1
ABCDEF
```
**Output**: 
```
2
3
1
```

# Test 3
**Objective**: Evaluate the function when the number of available problems is significantly less than required, forcing Vlad to create many new problems.
**Input**: 
```

2 5
ABC
4 5
ABCDEF
3 5
ABC
```
**Output**: 
```
4
3
2
```

# Test 4
**Objective**: Test the function with the maximum number of rounds (m=5) and ensure it handles the case where only one problem type is available.
**Input**: 
```
3
1 5
A
2 5
AB
3 5
ABC
```
**Output**: 
```
4
3
2
```

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles the case where the number of available problems is just enough to cover the rounds but with a mix of difficulty levels.
**Input**: 
```
3
7 5
ABCDEF
8 5
ABCDEF
9 5
ABCDEF
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```

# Test 6
**Objective**: Test the function with the minimum number of available problems (n=1) and different values of m.
**Input**: 
```
3
1 1
A
1 2
A
1 3
A
```
**Output**: 
```
0
1
2
```

# Test 7
**Objective**: Check the function when the number of available problems is equal to the number of rounds but with a mix of difficulty levels that might require additional problems.
**Input**: 
```
3
5 5
ABCDE
6 5
ABCDEF
7 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0

```

# Test 8
**Objective**: Test the function with the maximum number of available problems (n=50) and different values of m.
**Input**: 
```
3
50 1
ABCDEFG
50 2
ABCDEFG
50 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```

# Test 9
**Objective**: Evaluate the function when the input string contains duplicate characters, ensuring it counts each character correctly.
**Input**: 
```
3
10 1
AAAAA
10 1
BBBBB
10 1
CCCCCC
```
**Output**: 
```
4
4
4
```

# Test 10
**Objective**: Test the function with an empty input string, ensuring it handles this case gracefully.
**Input**: 
```
3
0 1
