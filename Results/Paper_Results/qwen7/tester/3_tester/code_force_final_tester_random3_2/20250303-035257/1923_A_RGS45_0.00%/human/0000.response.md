### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all chips are already in a single block.

**Input**:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when chips are spread out but can be moved to form a single block with minimal operations.

**Input**:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when all cells contain chips.

**Input**:
```
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when only one cell contains a chip.

**Input**:
```
2
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works correctly when chips are spread out but can be moved to form a single block with multiple operations.

**Input**:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when there is only one chip and many free cells.

**Input**:
```
6
0 0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when there is only one chip and no free cells to its left.

**Input**:
```
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when there are multiple chips but no free cells to the left of any chip.

**Input**:
```
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when all cells are free except for one chip.

**Input**:
```
5
1 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Evaluate the function's behavior when the number of cells is at the maximum limit and the chips are optimally placed to minimize moves.

**Input**:
```
50
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
25
```

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
