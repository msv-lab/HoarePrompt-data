To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the simplest case where \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
2 1
```
**Explanation**: The only possible permutation of length 2 is [2, 1] or [1, 2]. Both permutations are 2-level because the sum of the elements is either 3 or 3, and thus the difference is 0, which is less than or equal to 1.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify a case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 3 2
```
**Explanation**: The permutation [1, 3, 2] has sums of [4, 5], and the difference between the maximum and minimum sum is 1, making it a valid 2-level permutation.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify a case where \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**:
```
1
4 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: The permutation [1, 2, 3, 4] has sums of [3, 5, 7], and the difference between the maximum and minimum sum is 4, which is greater than 1. However, we can use a different permutation like [1, 4, 2, 3] which gives sums [5, 6, 5] and the difference is 1.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify a case where \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 4 \).
**Input**:
```
1
4 4
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4
```
**Explanation**: Since \( k = 4 \), the only possible sum is the sum of all elements, which is 10. Thus, the permutation is trivially 4-level.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the case where \( n = 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k = 2 \).
**Input**:
```
1
200000 2
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 ... 199999 200000
```
**Explanation**: The permutation [1, 2, 3, ..., 200000] will have sums of [3, 5, 7, ..., 399999], and the difference between the maximum and minimum sum is 199998, which is much larger than 1. However, we can use a different permutation like [1, 200000, 2, 199999, ..., 100001, 100000] which ensures the sums are close together.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where \( n = 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k = 2 \times 10^5 \).
**Input**:
```
1
200000 200000
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
```
**Explanation**: The permutation is trivially k-level because the only possible sum is the sum of all elements, which is the same.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where \( n = 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k = 100000 \).
**Input**:
```
1
200000 100000
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 ... 100000 100001 100002 ... 200000
```
**Explanation**: The permutation can be constructed such that the sums of any segment of length 100000 are close together. One way to do this is to alternate between high and low numbers.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where \( n = 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k = 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \).
**Input**:
```
1
200000 199998
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
```
**Explanation**: The permutation can be constructed to ensure the sums of any segment of length 199998 are close together. One way to do this is to alternate between high and low numbers.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios and should help ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.
