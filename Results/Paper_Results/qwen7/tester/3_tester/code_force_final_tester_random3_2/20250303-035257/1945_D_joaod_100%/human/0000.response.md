# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small example where Kirill can easily move to the front of the queue.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move from position 4 to position 2. The cost is `a_3 + b_2 = 6 + 3 = 9`. He can then move from position 2 to position 1. The cost is `a_1 = 7`. Total cost = 14.

# Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a larger example where Kirill has to make multiple moves.
**Input**: 
```
1
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move from position 6 to position 5, then to position 4, and finally to position 2. The costs are `a_4 + b_3 + a_2 = 1 + 8 + 9 = 18`. He can then move from position 2 to position 1. The cost is `a_1 = 6`. Total cost = 22.

# Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where Kirill needs to move to the first position and there are no intermediate positions to move through.
**Input**: 
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move directly from position 7 to position 1. The cost is `a_6 + b_5 + a_4 + b_3 + a_2 + b_1 = 5 + 1 + 2 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 29`. However, since he only needs to be in the first position, the minimal cost is just `a_6 = 5`.

# Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where Kirill can move directly to the desired position without any intermediate moves.
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move directly from position 2 to position 1. The cost is `a_1 = 3`.

# Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where Kirill cannot move to the desired position due to high costs.
**Input**: 
```
1
4 2
10 10 10 10
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move from position 4 to position 3, then to position 2. The costs are `a_3 + b_2 + a_1 = 10 + 1 + 10 = 21`. However, since he only needs to be in the first position, the minimal cost is just `a_3 = 10`.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the queue size is large and Kirill needs to move through many intermediate positions.
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move from position 10 to position 9, then to position 8, and so on until position 5. The total cost is `a_9 + b_8 + a_7 + b_6 + a_5 + b_4 + a_3 + b_2 + a_1 = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55`.

# Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where Kirill can move to the desired position but there are high costs for intermediate moves.
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
30
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move from position 5 to position 4, then to position 3. The costs are `a_4 + b_3 + a_2 = 40 + 3 + 20 = 63`. However, since he only needs to be in the third position, the minimal cost is just `a_4 = 40`.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the queue size is large and Kirill can move to the desired position with minimal intermediate costs.
**Input**:

```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move from position 10 to position 5. The cost is `a_5 = 1`.

# Test 9
