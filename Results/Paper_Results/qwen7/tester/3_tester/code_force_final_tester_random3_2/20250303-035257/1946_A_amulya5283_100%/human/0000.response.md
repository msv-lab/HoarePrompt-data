# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element to 3, the array becomes [3, 2, 8], and the median is now 3. This requires only 1 operation.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the first and third elements to 4, the array becomes [4, 3, 4, 1], and the median is now 3.5. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing the only element to 1000000001, the median is now 1000000001. This requires only 1 operation.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the last four elements to 6, the array becomes [5, 5, 5, 6, 6], and the median is now 5.5. This requires 3 operations.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first and third elements to 3, the array becomes [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4], and the median is now 3. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 2] is 1.5. By increasing the first element to 2, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is now 2. This requires only 1 operation.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements to 2, the array becomes [2, 2], and the median is now 2. This requires 2 operations.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: The median of the array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. Since all elements are already equal to the median, no operations are needed.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
3
3
1 2 3
4
2 2 2 2
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
0
0
```
*Explanation*: In each of these arrays, all elements are already equal to the median, so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
3
3
8 2 5
4
1 3 3 7
5
2 4 6 8 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1
2
0
```
*Explanation*: 
- For the array [8, 2, 5], the median is 5. Increasing the second element to 6 results in [8, 6, 5], and the median is now 6. This requires 1 operation.
- For the array [1, 3, 3, 7], the median is 3. Increasing the first and second elements to 4 results in [4, 4, 3, 7], and the median is now 4. This requires 2 operations.
- For the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the median is 6. All elements are already greater than or equal to 6, so no operations are needed.
