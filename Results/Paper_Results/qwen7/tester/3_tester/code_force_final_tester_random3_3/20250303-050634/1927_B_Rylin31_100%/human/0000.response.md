```
abracadabra
codeforces
```
**Explanation**: This test case checks the function's ability to handle multiple test cases in one input. It verifies that the function can correctly generate two different strings based on their respective traces.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
