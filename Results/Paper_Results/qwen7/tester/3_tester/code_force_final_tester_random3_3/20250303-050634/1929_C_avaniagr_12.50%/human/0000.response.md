# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Sasha can achieve any number of coins by following the strategy mentioned in the problem statement.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: Sasha cannot achieve more than 1 coin since he starts with 1 coin and cannot place a bet without risking losing all his coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Sasha can achieve any number of coins by following the strategy mentioned in the problem statement, even with up to 3 consecutive losses allowed.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: With a multiplier of 3, Sasha needs to win at least 3 times in a row to double his coins, which is impossible given the constraint of 3 consecutive losses allowed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: With a multiplier of 4, Sasha needs to win 4 times in a row to increase his coins significantly, which is impossible given the constraint of 4 consecutive losses allowed.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
*Explanation*: Sasha can achieve any number of coins by following the strategy mentioned in the problem statement, even with up to 4 consecutive losses allowed.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 88 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: Even with a large initial amount of coins, the constraint of 88 consecutive losses makes it impossible for Sasha to achieve any arbitrary number of coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
25 69 231
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: With a large multiplier and a high limit on consecutive losses, it is impossible for Sasha to achieve any arbitrary number of coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
13 97 18806
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
*Explanation*: With a high multiplier and a high limit on consecutive losses, it is impossible for Sasha to achieve any arbitrary number of coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1 1000000000
10 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
NO
```
*Explanation*: For the first case, Sasha can achieve any number of coins with a multiplier of 2 and no limit on consecutive losses. For the second case, Sasha cannot achieve more than 1 coin due to the high multiplier and the constraint of 1 consecutive loss allowed.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
3 10 1
3 10 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
YES
```
*Explanation*: For the first case, Sasha cannot achieve more than 1 coin due to the high multiplier and the constraint of 10 consecutive losses allowed. For the second case, Sasha can achieve any number of coins with a multiplier of 3 and a higher initial amount of coins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
2 2 1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
NO
```
*Explanation*: For both cases, Sasha cannot achieve more than 2 coins due to the constraint of 2 consecutive losses allowed and starting with only 1 or 2 coins.
