### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are many participants.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1666666667
```
**Explanation**: There are 1 billion introverts, 1 billion extroverts, and 1 billion universals. The calculation involves dividing the total number of people by 3 (since each tent can hold at most 3 people).

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are zero participants.
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: There are no participants, so no tents are needed.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are only introverts.
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: There are 1 billion introverts, each needing 1 tent alone.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are only extroverts.
**Input**:
```
1
0 1000000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
-1
```
**Explanation**: There are 1 billion extroverts who need 2 others to share a tent, but there are no others available.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are only universals.
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
333333333
```
**Explanation**: There are 1 billion universals, which can be accommodated in 333333333 tents, with each tent holding 3 people.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the case where there are many extroverts and universals.
**Input**:
```
1
0 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
500000000
```
**Explanation**: There are 1 billion extroverts and 1 billion universals. The 1 billion extroverts can be paired with the 1 billion universals, requiring 500 million tents.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, from simple to complex, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
