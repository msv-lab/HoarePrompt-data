To address the given problem, we need to implement test cases that cover both basic and edge scenarios. Below are the comprehensive test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start near each other but not directly adjacent.

**Input**:
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3). Bob can move to (1, 3). If Alice moves to (3, 2), Bob can move to (2, 2), and Alice can then move to (4, 2), capturing Bob's chip.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Bob starts directly below Alice.

**Input**:
```
4 1 2 1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Explanation**: Bob can move to (3, 1), and Alice can only move to (3, 1) or (3, 0) (out of bounds). Thus, Bob captures Alice's chip.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same column but different rows.

**Input**:
```
1 4 1 3 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the last row and cannot move further down. Bob is in the first row and cannot move further up. Hence, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same row but different columns.

**Input**:
```
5 5 1 4 5 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the first row and cannot move further up. Bob is in the fifth row and cannot move further down. Hence, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start far apart and cannot reach each other.

**Input**:
```
4 4 1 1 4 4
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the first row and cannot move further up. Bob is in the fourth row and cannot move further down. Hence, the game ends in a draw.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start at the boundaries and cannot move further.

**Input**:
```
10 10 1 6 10 8
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (2, 5), (2, 7), or (2, 6). Bob can move to (9, 7), (9, 9), or (9, 8). If Alice moves to (2, 7), Bob can move to (9, 7), and Alice can then move to (10, 7), capturing Bob's chip.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start very close but not directly adjacent.

**Input**:
```
10 10 2 6 10 7
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice and Bob are too far apart to capture each other's chip within the given constraints. Hence, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the corners.

**Input**:
```
10 10 9 1 8 1
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the ninth row and cannot move further down. Bob is in the eighth row and cannot move further up. Hence, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the middle and cannot reach each other.

**Input**:
```
10 10 8 1 10 2
```
**Output**:
```
Draw
```
**Explanation**: Alice is in the eighth row and cannot move further down. Bob is in the tenth row and cannot move further up. Hence, the game ends in a draw.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same row but different columns, with Alice in the first column.

**Input**:
```
10 10 1 1 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (2, 1), (2, 0) (out of bounds), or (2, 2). Bob can move to (9, 1). If Alice moves to (2, 2), Bob can move to (9, 2), and Alice can then move to (10, 2), capturing Bob's chip.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same row but different columns, with Bob in the first column.

**Input**:
```
10 10 1 3 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (2, 2), (2, 3), or (2, 4). Bob can move to (3, 1). If Alice moves to (2, 2), Bob can move to (3, 2), and Alice can then move to (4, 2), capturing Bob's chip.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the game outcome when Alice and Bob start in the same row but different columns, with Alice in the last column.

**Input**:
```
10 10 3 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Explanation**: Alice can move to (4, 0) (out of bounds), (4, 1), or (4, 2). Bob can move to (2, 1). If Alice moves to (4, 1), Bob can move to (3, 1), and Alice can then move to (5, 1), capturing Bob's chip.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
