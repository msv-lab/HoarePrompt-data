### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: There is a chip in the 7th cell, which can be moved to the 5th cell, making all chips form a single block.

#### Test 2
**Input**: 
```
6
0 1 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All chips are already in a single block.

#### Test 3
**Input**: 
```
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: All cells contain chips, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two operations are needed to move the chips to form a single block. First, move the chip in the 5th cell to the 3rd cell, then move the chip in the 1st cell to the 2nd cell.

#### Test 5
**Input**: 
```
9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: Three operations are needed to move the chips to form a single block. Move the chip in the 9th cell to the 7th cell, then move the chip in the 5th cell to the 4th cell, and finally move the chip in the 1st cell to the 2nd cell.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Both cells contain chips, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
4
1 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One operation is needed to move the chip in the 4th cell to the 3rd cell.

#### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
4
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: Two operations are needed to move the chips to form a single block. First, move the chip in the 5th cell to the 4th cell, then move the chip in the 1st cell to the 2nd cell.

#### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
5
0 1 1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One operation is needed to move the chip in the 5th cell to the 4th cell.

#### Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One operation is needed to move the chip in the 3rd cell to the 2nd cell.

#### Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 0 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One operation is needed to move the chip in the 2nd cell to the 1st cell.

#### Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One operation is needed to move the chip in the 4th cell to the 3rd cell.

#### Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Explanation**: One operation is needed to move the chip in the 5th cell to the 4th cell.

#### Test 14
