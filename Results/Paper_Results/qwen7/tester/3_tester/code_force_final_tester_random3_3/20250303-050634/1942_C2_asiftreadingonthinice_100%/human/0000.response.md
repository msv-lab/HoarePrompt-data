To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
7 3 1
6 4 3
4 2 2
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
6
5
2
```

#### Explanation:
- For the first test case, with \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), and \( y = 2 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 6, 2, and 5. By choosing 2 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 6.
- For the second test case, with \( n = 7 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( y = 1 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 6, 4, and 3. By choosing 1 additional vertex, we can maximize the number of triangles to 5.
- For the third test case, with \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 2 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 3. By choosing 2 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 2.

#### Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
6 3 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
5
```

#### Explanation:
- For the test case with \( n = 6 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( y = 3 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 2, and 3. By choosing 3 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 5.

#### Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 2 1
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```

#### Explanation:
- For the test case with \( n = 5 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 1 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 3. By choosing 1 additional vertex, we can maximize the number of triangles to 3.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
4 2 0
1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```

#### Explanation:
- For the test case with \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 3. Since no additional vertices can be chosen, the maximum number of triangles is 2.

#### Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 0
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
7
```

#### Explanation:
- For the test case with \( n = 10 \), \( x = 5 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since no additional vertices can be chosen, the maximum number of triangles is 7.

#### Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
10 5 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
10
```

#### Explanation:
- For the test case with \( n = 10 \), \( x = 5 \), and \( y = 5 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. By choosing 5 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to 10.

#### Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 0
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
999999998
```

#### Explanation:
- For the test case with \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 0 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 2. Since no additional vertices can be chosen, the maximum number of triangles is \( n - 2 = 999999998 \).

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2 1000000000
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```

#### Explanation:
- For the test case with \( n = 1000000000 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 1000000000 \), the vertices chosen by Bessie are 1 and 2. By choosing 1000000000 additional vertices, we can maximize the number of triangles to \( n - 2 = 1000000000 \).

### Summary
These test cases cover a range of scenarios, including typical use cases and edge cases, ensuring the solution is robust and reliable.
