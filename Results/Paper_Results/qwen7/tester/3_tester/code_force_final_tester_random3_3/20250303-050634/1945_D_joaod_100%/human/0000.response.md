**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
0 0 0
0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 8

**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```

# Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the queue is empty, which should not occur but is included for completeness.

**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
0
0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```

# Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the maximum allowable final position is greater than the queue size, which should not occur but is included for completeness.

**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```

# Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where all costs are the same and Kirill needs to move to the first position.

**Input**: 
```
1
5 1
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```

# Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the queue size is at the upper limit and Kirill needs to move to the first position.

**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
200000
```

# Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the queue size is at the upper limit and Kirill needs to move to the last allowed position.

**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
10000000000
```

# Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the queue size is at the upper limit and Kirill needs to move to the middle position.

**Input**: 
```
1
200000 100000
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
1 2 3 ... 199999 200000
