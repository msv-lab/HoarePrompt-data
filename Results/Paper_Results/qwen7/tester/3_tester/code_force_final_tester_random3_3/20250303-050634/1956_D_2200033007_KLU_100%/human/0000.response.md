### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Input**: 
```
2
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
4 1
1 2
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0, 1]. By performing one operation on the entire array, we can change all elements to 2, resulting in the array [2, 2], which has a sum of 4.

#### Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [1, 3, 9]. No operations are needed since the sum of the array is already maximized at 13.

#### Test 3
**Input**: 
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [1, 100, 2, 1]. We perform two operations: first, change the third element to 0 (the MEX of [2]), then change the fourth element to 0. This results in the array [1, 100, 0, 0], which has a sum of 101. However, changing the third and fourth elements to 2 (the MEX of [0]) gives us the array [1, 100, 2, 2], which has a sum of 105.

#### Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
0
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1
1 1
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0]. By performing one operation on the entire array, we can change all elements to 1, resulting in the array [1], which has a sum of 1.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Input**: 
```
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
5 5
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. By performing five operations, we can change all elements to 1, resulting in the array [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], which has a sum of 5.

#### Test 6
**Input**: 
```
6
10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
60000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000, 10000000]. No operations are needed since the sum of the array is already maximized at 60000000.

#### Test 7
**Input**: 
```
3
10000000 0 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
20000000 1
2 3
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [10000000, 0, 10000000]. By performing one operation on the subarray [0, 10000000], we can change both elements to 1, resulting in the array [10000000, 1, 1], which has a sum of 20000000.

#### Test 8
**Input**: 
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
10 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. No operations are needed since the sum of the array is already maximized at 10.

#### Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
10000000 10000000
```
**Output**: 
```
20000000 0
```
**Explanation**: The initial array is [10000000, 10000000]. No operations are needed since the sum of the array is already maximized at 20000000.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution handles various input conditions effectively.
