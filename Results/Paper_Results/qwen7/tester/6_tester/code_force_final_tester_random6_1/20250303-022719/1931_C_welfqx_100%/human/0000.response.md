To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here is the detailed plan:

### Basic Test Cases
1. **Single Element Array**: The array has only one element.
2. **All Elements Are Already Equal**: All elements in the array are the same.
3. **Array with Identical Elements Except One**: Most elements are the same, but one is different.
4. **Array with Identical Elements Except Two**: Most elements are the same, but two are different.
5. **Array with Identical Elements Except Many**: Most elements are the same, but many are different.
6. **Array with Sequential Elements**: The array has a sequence of numbers.
7. **Array with Random Elements**: The array has random elements within the range.

### Edge Test Cases
1. **Large Array Size**: The array size is at the maximum limit.
2. **All Elements Are Different**: Each element in the array is unique.
3. **Single Element in Large Array**: The array has a large number of elements, but only one is different.
4. **Multiple Groups of Identical Elements**: The array has multiple groups of identical elements.
5. **Array with Repeated Values**: The array has repeated values with gaps.

Now, let's implement these test cases:
