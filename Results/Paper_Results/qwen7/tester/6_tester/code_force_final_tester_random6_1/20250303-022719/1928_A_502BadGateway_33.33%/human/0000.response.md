# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
*Explanation*: A 2x1 rectangle can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which are considered the same when rotated.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 6
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
6 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```

**Input**: 
```
1
10 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
*Explanation*: A 10x100 rectangle can be cut into two 10x50 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 50x10 rectangle, which is different from the original.
