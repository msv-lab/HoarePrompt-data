# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
0
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 2\), the simplest array is \([0]\). It has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just the element 0.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 0
```
*Explanation*: The array \([0, 1, 0]\) has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), \([0, 1]\), and \([0, 0]\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
13
```
**Output**: 
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
*Explanation*: The array \([2, 2, 3, 4, 2]\) has exactly 13 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([2]\), \([2]\), \([3]\), \([4]\), \([2, 2]\), \([2, 3]\), \([2, 4]\), \([2, 2, 3]\), \([2, 2, 4]\), \([2, 3, 4]\), \([2, 2, 3, 4]\), and \([2, 2, 2, 3, 4]\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
37
```
**Output**: 
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```
*Explanation*: The array \([-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]\) has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. This can be verified by counting all possible increasing subsequences.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: For \(X = 1\), there is no valid array because the only increasing subsequence would be the empty one, which does not meet the requirement of having exactly 1 increasing subsequence.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: For such a large value of \(X\), it is impossible to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \(10^{18}\) increasing subsequences. Hence, the output is -1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
0 1
```
*Explanation*: The array \([0, 1]\) has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), and \([0, 1]\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
*Explanation*: The array \([0, 1, 2]\) has exactly 6 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), \([2]\), \([0, 1]\), and \([0, 1, 2]\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
4
0 1 2 3
```
*Explanation*: The array \([0, 1, 2, 3]\) has exactly 10 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), \([2]\), \([3]\), \([0, 1]\), \([0, 2]\), \([0, 3]\), \([1, 2]\), and \([0, 1, 2, 3]\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
9
```
**Output**: 
```
3
0 1 2
```
*Explanation*: The array \([0, 1, 2]\) has exactly 9 increasing subsequences: \(\emptyset\), \([0]\), \([1]\), \([2]\), \([0, 1]\), \([0, 2]\), \([1, 2]\), and \([0, 1, 2]\).

These test cases cover basic and edge scenarios, ensuring the solution's robustness and reliability.
