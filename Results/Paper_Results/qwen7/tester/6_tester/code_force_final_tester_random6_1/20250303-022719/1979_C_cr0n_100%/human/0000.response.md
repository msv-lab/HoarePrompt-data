# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
**Output**: 
```
27 41 12 
```
*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where the number of outcomes is 3, and the multipliers are 3, 2, and 7. The solution provided meets the requirement that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is another basic test case with 2 outcomes and multipliers 3 and 3. The solution provided ensures that the total bet (1+1=2) is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome (3).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This is an edge case where all multipliers are the same (5). Since the total bet cannot be less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, the function should return -1.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```
**Output**: 
```
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
```
*Explanation*: This is a more complex case with 6 outcomes and different multipliers. The solution provided ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
3
6 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
*Explanation*: This is an edge case where the multipliers are 6, 3, and 2. Since the smallest multiplier is 2, the total bet cannot be less than the amount received back for the outcome with multiplier 2, making it impossible to find a valid distribution.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5
9 4 6 8 3
```
**Output**: 
```
8 18 12 9 24 
```
*Explanation*: This is a case with 5 outcomes and different multipliers. The solution provided ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
1
10
1
2
2
10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
-1 
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes two sub-cases. In the first sub-case, there is only one outcome with a multiplier of 10. The solution is simply to bet 1 coin, which is less than 10. In the second sub-case, both multipliers are 10, making it impossible to find a valid distribution.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
3
1
2
1
3
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
1 
1 
```
*Explanation*: This test case includes three sub-cases. Each sub-case has only one outcome with different multipliers (2, 3, and 20 respectively). The solution is to bet 1 coin in each case, which is less than the multiplier for each winning outcome.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
```
**Output**: 
```
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 10 
```
*Explanation*: This is a case with 10 outcomes and increasing multipliers from 11 to 20. The solution provided ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 
```
*Explanation*: This is a case with only one outcome and a multiplier of 2. The solution is to bet 1 coin, which is less than 2.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
50
2 3 4 5 ... 51
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 ... 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is a case with 50 outcomes, each with a multiplier starting from 2 up to 51. The solution is to bet 1 coin on each outcome, ensuring the total bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10
20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11
```
**Output**: 
```
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is a case with 10 outcomes and decreasing multipliers from 20 down to 11. The solution provided ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
