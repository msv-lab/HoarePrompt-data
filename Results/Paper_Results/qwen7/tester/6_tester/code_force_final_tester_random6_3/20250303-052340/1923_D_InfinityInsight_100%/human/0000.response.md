# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
4
3 2 4 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1 2 1 
```
*Explanation*: This is the given example in the problem statement. The first slime (size 3) will be eaten by the third slime after 2 seconds, the second slime (size 2) will be eaten by the first slime after 1 second, the fourth slime (size 2) will be eaten by the third slime after 2 seconds, and the third slime (size 4) will be eaten by the fifth slime after 1 second.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 -1 
```
*Explanation*: The first slime (size 1) cannot eat any other slime, so it will be eaten immediately by the second slime after 1 second. The second slime (size 2) will eat the first slime after 1 second. The third slime (size 3) cannot be eaten by any other slime, so it is impossible for it to be eaten.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
2 2 3 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1 -1 1 2 
```
*Explanation*: The first two slimes (both size 2) will be eaten by the third slime after 2 seconds. The fourth slime (size 1) will be eaten by the third slime after 1 second. The fifth slime (size 1) will be eaten by the third slime after 2 seconds.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
7
4 2 3 6 1 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
2 1 1 3 1 1 4 
```
*Explanation*: The first slime (size 4) will be eaten by the third slime after 2 seconds. The second slime (size 2) will be eaten by the third slime after 1 second. The fourth slime (size 3) will be eaten by the third slime after 1 second. The fifth slime (size 6) will be eaten by the seventh slime after 3 seconds. The sixth slime (size 1) will be eaten by the fifth slime after 1 second. The seventh slime (size 8) will be eaten by the fifth slime after 1 second.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
2
1
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 
1000000000 
```
*Explanation*: For the first test case, there is only one slime, so it is impossible for it to be eaten. For the second test case, the only slime (size 1000000000) will eat itself after 1000000000 seconds.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
2
2
1 1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1 
-1 -1 -1 
```
*Explanation*: In both cases, there are slimes of the same size next to each other, and none of them can eat the other, making it impossible for any slime to be eaten.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
2
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 
-1 -1 -1 
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, each slime can eat the next slime immediately, resulting in 1 second for each slime to be eaten. In the second test case, all slimes are of the same size and cannot eat each other, making it impossible for any slime to be eaten.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
1 1 1 1 1 
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, each slime can eat the next slime immediately, resulting in 1 second for each slime to be eaten. In the second test case, each slime can eat the next slime immediately, resulting in 1 second for each slime to be eaten.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
4
1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
-1 -1 -1 -1 
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, each slime can eat the next slime immediately, resulting in 1 second for each slime to be eaten. In the second test case, all slimes are of the same size and cannot eat each other, making it impossible for any slime to be eaten.

# Test 10
**Input**:

**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 
```
*Explanation*: In the first test case, each slime can eat the next slime immediately, resulting in 1 second for each slime to be eaten. In the second test case, all slimes are of the same size and cannot eat each other, making it impossible for any slime to be eaten.
