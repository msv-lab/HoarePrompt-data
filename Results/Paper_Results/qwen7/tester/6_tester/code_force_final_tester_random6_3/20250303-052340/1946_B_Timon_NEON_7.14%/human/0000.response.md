To address the given problem, we need to implement a solution that maximizes the sum of the array after performing up to `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. Here are the comprehensive test cases for the described problem:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small array and a few operations.
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
-4 -7
```
**Output**:
```
999999996
```
**Explanation**: By inserting zeros (sum of an empty subarray), the final array becomes [-4, -7, 0, 0], and the sum is -11, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 999999996.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a larger array and a few operations.
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
2 2 8
```
**Output**:
```
96
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array three times results in [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48], and the sum is 96.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a single element and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1
1 7
7
```
**Output**:
```
896
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum (7) seven times results in [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], and the sum is 896.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a medium-sized array and a single operation.
**Input**:
```
1
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```
**Output**:
```
17
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the subarray [4, -2, 8] at the beginning results in [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9], and the sum is 17.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has negative elements and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1
7 100
5 3 -8 12 -5 -9 3
```
**Output**:
```
351
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array 100 times results in a very large sum, but modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 351.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has extremely large negative elements and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1
6 1000
-1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000 -1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
716455332
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array 1000 times results in a very large sum, but modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 716455332.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has a single positive element and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1000000000 8
```
**Output**:
```
42
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array once results in [1000000008, 8], and the sum is 1000000016, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 42.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has all zeros and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1
5 4
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
42
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array four times results in [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the sum is 0, which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 0.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has a mix of positive and negative elements and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1
6 10
48973 757292 58277 -38574 27475 999984
```
**Output**:
```
897909241
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array ten times results in a very large sum, but modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 897909241.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has alternating positive and negative elements and one operation.
**Input**:
```
1
7 1
-1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000 1000 -1000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array once results in a sum of zero.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the edge case where the array has a mix of positive and negative elements and many operations.
**Input**:
```
1
10 10050
408293874 -3498597 7374783 295774930 -48574034 26623784 498754833 -294875830 283045804 85938045
```
**Output**:
```
897909241
```
**Explanation**: Inserting the sum of the entire array 10050 times results in a very large sum, but modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives 897909241.

These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the robustness and reliability of the solution.
