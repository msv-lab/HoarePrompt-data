# Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the basic functionality with a small number of ships and attacks.
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The first ship is attacked twice, but its durability is 3, so it remains intact. The second ship is attacked once and sinks, but since the first ship is still intact, the Kraken cannot attack it again.

```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

**Input**:
```
1
2 1
3 2
```

```
1
```

```
1
2 3
3 3

**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the number of attacks is greater than the durability of the first ship.
**Input**:
```
1
2 4
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The first ship is attacked four times, but its durability is only 3, so it sinks. The second ship is not attacked.

# Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the number of attacks is sufficient to sink both ships.
**Input**:
```
1
2 5
3 3
```

**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 1
```

```
0
```
**Explanation**: The first ship is attacked once and sinks, but there are no more attacks left, so the second ship remains intact.

# Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the number of attacks is just enough to sink the last ship.
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The first ship is not attacked, and the second ship is attacked twice and sinks.

**Objective**: Verify the scenario where the number of attacks is just enough to sink the first ship.
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The first ship is attacked twice and sinks, and the second ship is not attacked.

**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: All ships are attacked multiple times and sink.

```
1
4 3
1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The first ship is attacked three times and its durability is reduced to 0, but the second, third, and fourth ships are not attacked.

# Test 15

**Input**:
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The first and last ships are attacked and sink, while the second and third ships are not attacked.

# Test 16

**Input**:
```
1
4 10
1 5 3 4
```

```
4
```
**Explanation**: All ships are attacked multiple times and sink.

# Test 17
