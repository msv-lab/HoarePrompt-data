To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we need to consider both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a sorted array.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [2, 4, 5] \) and \( t = [1, 3] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3 \).

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a reverse-sorted array.
**Input**:
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [4, 5] \) and \( t = [1, 2, 3] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 2 = 3 \).

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array containing duplicates but in increasing order.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [2, 3] \) and \( t = [1, 1, 2] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 2 = 3 \).

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array containing duplicates but in decreasing order.
**Input**:
```
1
5
3 2 2 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [1, 1] \) and \( t = [2, 2, 3] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3 \).

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of all the same elements.
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [\,] \) and \( t = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of size 1.
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [\,] \) and \( t = [1] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of size 2.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [\,] \) and \( t = [1, 2] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of size 2 where elements are the same.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [\,] \) and \( t = [1, 1] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of size 2 where elements are in reverse order.
**Input**:
```
1
2
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [2] \) and \( t = [1] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of size 2 where elements are in increasing order.
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [1] \) and \( t = [2] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of size 3 where elements are in increasing order.
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [2, 3] \) and \( t = [1] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 0 = 1 \).

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function works with an array of size 3 where elements are in decreasing order.
**Input**:
```
1
3
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal split would be \( s = [3] \) and \( t = [2, 1] \), resulting in a penalty of \( p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1 \).

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring the solution handles various input patterns and edge cases effectively.
