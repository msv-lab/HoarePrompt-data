Given the problem statement and the example provided, we need to create comprehensive test cases for the Hamiltonian path finding algorithm. Let's break down the test cases into basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Small Graph with Multiple Edges Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a small graph where multiple edges are removed.

**Input**:
```
3
4
```

**Output**:
```
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 4 3 1 2
```

#### Test 2: Medium Graph with Multiple Edges Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a medium-sized graph.

**Input**:
```
3
5
```

**Output**:
```
? 4
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 5 4 3 2 1
```

#### Test 3: Large Graph with Multiple Edges Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function works with a large graph.

**Input**:
```
3
10
```

**Output**:
```
? 9
? 8
? 7
? 6
? 5
? 4
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4: Graph with Only One Edge Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a graph with only one edge removed.

**Input**:
```
3
3
```

**Output**:
```
? 2
? 1
! 3 2 1
```

#### Test 5: Graph with All But Two Edges Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a graph with all but two edges removed.

**Input**:
```
3
4
```

**Output**:
```
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 4 3 2 1
```

#### Test 6: Graph with No Edges Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a complete graph with no edges removed.

**Input**:
```
3
4
```

**Output**:
```
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 1 2 3 4
```

#### Test 7: Graph with All Edges Removed
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a graph where all edges are removed, leaving only isolated vertices.

**Input**:
```
3
2
```

**Output**:
```
? 1
? 0
! 2 1
```

#### Test 8: Graph with Random Edge Removals
**Objective**: Verify the function handles a graph with random edge removals.

**Input**:
```
3
5
```

**Output**:
```
? 4
? 3
? 2
? 1
! 5 4 3 2 1
```

### Additional Notes

- Each test case should be designed to cover different scenarios to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
- The test cases should be run interactively, ensuring that the queries and responses are handled correctly.
- The output should match the expected format and content as described in the problem statement.

These test cases should help in verifying the correctness and robustness of the Hamiltonian path finding algorithm.
