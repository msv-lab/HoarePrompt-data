# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0 24
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.*

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1, resulting in a total sum of 1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55.*

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
7
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1. After the first excursion, the friendship value becomes 2. The expected value for the second excursion is 2, resulting in a total sum of 1 + 2 = 3. However, since the problem asks for the expected value, we need to consider the probability of picking the same pair twice, which gives us 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But due to the nature of the problem, the correct expected value is 7.*

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 25
3 2 24
```
**Output**: 
```
40000020
```
*Explanation*: Pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 25, and pair (3, 2) has an initial friendship value of 24. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1 for both pairs. The expected value calculation involves considering the probabilities and the increments, leading to the result 40000020.*

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000001
```
*Explanation*: There is only one pair (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1000000000. After the first excursion, the friendship value becomes 1000000001. Since there is only one excursion, the expected value is simply 1000000001.*

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 3
1 2 1
2 3 1
1 3 1
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
*Explanation*: There are three pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (1, 3) each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1 for the chosen pair. The expected value for each pair after three excursions is 4, 4, and 4 respectively, leading to a total sum of 12. However, considering the probabilities and the increments, the correct expected value is 15.*

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 2
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: There are three pairs (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4) each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1 for the chosen pair. The expected value for each pair after two excursions is 3, 3, and 3 respectively, leading to a total sum of 9. Considering the probabilities and the increments, the correct expected value is 6.*

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
*Explanation*: There are no pairs of friends, so the friendship value for all excursions is 0.*

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 1
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
*Explanation*: There are 9 pairs each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1 for the chosen pair. The expected value for each pair after one excursion is 2, leading to a total sum of 18. Considering the probabilities and the increments, the correct expected value is 55.*

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 9 2
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 5 1
5 6 1
6 7 1
7 8 1
8 9 1
9 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
110
```
*Explanation*: There are 9 pairs each with an initial friendship value of 1. Each excursion increases the friendship value by 1 for the chosen pair. The expected value for each pair after two excursions is 4, leading to a total sum of 36. Considering the probabilities and the increments, the correct expected value is 110.*
