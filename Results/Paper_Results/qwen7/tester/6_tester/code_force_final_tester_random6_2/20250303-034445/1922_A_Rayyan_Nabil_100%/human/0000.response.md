To create comprehensive test cases for the given problem, we will cover both basic and edge scenarios. Here are the detailed test cases:

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the function works when `a`, `b` match the template and `c` does not.
**Input**:
```
1
2
aa
bb
cc
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "CC" would work since `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the function works when `a`, `b` match the template and `c` does not.
**Input**:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "ABC" would work since `a`, `b`, and `c` match but `d`, `e`, and `f` do not.

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the function works when `a`, `b` match the template and `c` does not.
**Input**:
```
1
5
mathforces
luckforces
adhoccoder
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "MATHFORCES" would work since `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the function works when `a`, `b` match the template and `c` does not.
**Input**:
```
1
3
acc
abd
abc
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "ACC" would work since `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.
**Input**:
```
1
3
abc
abc
abc
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` have no common characters.
**Input**:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because `a`, `b`, and `c` have no common characters.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all empty strings.
**Input**:
```
1
0
""
""
""
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because all strings are empty.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all single-character strings.
**Input**:
```
1
1
a
b
c
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "A" would work since `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

#### Test 9
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same single character.
**Input**:
```
1
1
a
a
a
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

#### Test 10
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same multi-character string.
**Input**:
```
1
3
aaa
bbb
ccc
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

#### Test 11
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all different multi-character strings.
**Input**:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because `a`, `b`, and `c` are different.

#### Test 12
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same length but have no common characters.
**Input**:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because `a`, `b`, and `c` have no common characters.

#### Test 13
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same length but have some common characters.
**Input**:
```
1
3
abc
abc
def
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The template "ABC" would work since `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

#### Test 14
**Objective**: Verify the function handles when `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same length but have no common characters.
**Input**:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: There is no template that can make `a` and `b` match but `c` not match because `a`, `b`, and `c` have no common characters.
