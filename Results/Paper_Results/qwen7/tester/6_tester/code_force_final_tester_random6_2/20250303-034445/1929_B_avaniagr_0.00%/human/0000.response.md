# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: This is the basic test case where Sasha needs to color 2 cells to have 4 diagonals with at least one colored cell.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: Coloring 2 cells can satisfy the condition of having 3 diagonals with at least one colored cell.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: In a 3x3 grid, coloring 6 cells ensures that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
*Explanation*: Coloring 5 cells can ensure that 9 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
*Explanation*: In a 4x4 grid, coloring 4 cells can ensure that 7 out of the 14 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
*Explanation*: In a 7x7 grid, coloring 6 cells can ensure that 11 out of the 46 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
*Explanation*: In a 2x2 grid, coloring 2 cells can ensure that 3 out of the 6 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
3 2
3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: Two separate test cases with the same input to check if the solution handles identical inputs correctly.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
100000000 400000000
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
400000000
```
*Explanation*: Large values for n and k to test the performance and correctness of the solution for very large inputs.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
2
2 1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: Smallest possible grid to test the boundary conditions.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
2
2 3
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
*Explanation*: Testing the scenario where k is greater than the total number of diagonals.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
2
5 10
5 11
```
**Output**: 
```
5
6
```
*Explanation*: Testing the scenario where the required number of diagonals is close to but less than the total number of diagonals.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
2
10 20
10 21
```
**Output**: 
```
10
11
```
*Explanation*: Testing the scenario where the required number of diagonals is close to but less than the total number of diagonals for larger grids.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
2
100 200
100 201
```
**Output**: 
```
200
201
```
*Explanation*: Testing the scenario where the required number of diagonals is close to but less than the total number of diagonals for even larger grids.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
2
100000000 400000000
100000000 400000001
```
**Output**: 
```
400000000
400000001
```
*Explanation*: Testing the scenario where the required number of diagonals is just slightly more than the total number of diagonals for very large grids.
