*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where `n = 2` and `k = 1`. The array `[2, 1, 1, 2]` is provided. We need to find two subsets `l` and `r` each of length 2 such that their XOR values are equal. Here, `l = [1, 2]` and `r = [1, 2]` satisfy the condition since `1 ^ 2 = 1 ^ 2 = 3`.

*Explanation*: This is a basic test case where `n = 6` and `k = 3`. The array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` is provided. We need to find two subsets `l` and `r` each of length 6 such that their XOR values are equal. Here, `l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `r = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` satisfy the condition since `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6 = 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 ^ 6 = 0`.
