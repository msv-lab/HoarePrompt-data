# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 2, Sasha concatenates 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Anna has no other possible moves, so Sasha wins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna reverses 1 to get 1, then Sasha can concatenate 9 and 56 to form 956, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna cannot reverse 1 again because Sasha can always concatenate the remaining numbers to form a number greater than \(10^5\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 10
1 2007 800 1580
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse 1 to get 1, but Sasha can concatenate 2007 and 800 to form 2007800, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). No matter what Anna does, Sasha can always form a number greater than \(10^{10}\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
5000 123 30 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse 4 to get 4, but Sasha can concatenate 5000 and 123 to form 5000123, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Anna can only reverse 30 to 3, and Sasha can still concatenate 5000 and 123 to form 5000123, ensuring Sasha wins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
6 4 6 2 3 1 10 9 10 7
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Sasha can concatenate numbers to form a number greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\) on his first turn, ensuring Sasha wins.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: There is only one number, and it is 6, which is less than \(10^1 = 10\). Therefore, Anna wins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: There is only one number, and it is 10, which is greater than \(10^{10} = 10000000000\). Therefore, Sasha wins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
8 5
1 2 9 10 10 2 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Anna
```
*Explanation*: Anna can reverse 2 to get 2, but Sasha can concatenate 1 and 2 to form 12, and then concatenate 9 and 10 to form 910, and finally concatenate 12 and 910 to form 12910, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). No matter what Anna does, Sasha can always form a number greater than \(10^5\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
4 5
10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
Sasha
```
*Explanation*: Sasha can concatenate the four 10s to form 10101010, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Therefore, Sasha wins.
