Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n - 1`, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `visited`. This does not affect the values of `stack`, `A`, `g`, `k`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
