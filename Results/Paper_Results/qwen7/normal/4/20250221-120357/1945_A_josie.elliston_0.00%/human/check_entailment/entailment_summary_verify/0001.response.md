### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic in both functions and tests them with specific examples. However, there are a few points to consider that might affect the overall correctness of the program:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: The original assessment does not thoroughly cover edge cases where the number of participants could lead to an overflow issue due to the use of `int` types. Given the constraints \(0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9\), the sum of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` could exceed the maximum value that an `int` can hold in some programming languages (e.g., Python's `int` type can handle very large numbers, but it's still good practice to consider potential overflows).

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the condition where `extroverts % 3 != 0` and checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. However, it should also ensure that the total number of people (`extroverts + universals`) is at least 3 before calling `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`. This ensures that the division operation is meaningful.

3. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly sums the number of introverts with the result from `func_1`. However, it should also handle the case where the sum of `introverts` and the number of tents returned by `func_1` exceeds the maximum possible number of tents (which is theoretically unbounded but practically limited by the problem constraints).

Given these considerations, let's re-evaluate the program with a more thorough analysis:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. However, it should also ensure that `extroverts + universals >= 3` before calculating the number of tents.
   - Example: If `extroverts = 2` and `universals = 1`, then `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals = 3`, but `extroverts + universals = 3`, which is valid. However, if `extroverts = 2` and `universals = 0`, then `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals = 2`, which is invalid because `extroverts + universals = 2 < 3`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly sums the number of introverts with the result from `func_1`. However, it should handle the case where the sum of `introverts` and the number of tents returned by `func_1` exceeds the practical limit of tents (which is theoretically unbounded but practically limited by the problem constraints).

### Corrected Implementation

To ensure the program handles edge cases correctly, we can add additional checks:

```python
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional

# Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts + universals < 3:
        return None
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

# Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    if ret is None:
        return -1
    return introverts + ret
```

### Final Evaluation

After considering the edge cases and ensuring the logic handles them correctly, the program appears to be correct.

**Final: True**
