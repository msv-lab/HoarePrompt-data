Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not account for the constraints properly. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` needs to be adjusted to ensure all participants' preferences are respected and the minimum number of tents is calculated accurately.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals
    tents_for_extroverts_and_universals = ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    return tents_for_extroverts_and_universals

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for introverts
    tents_for_introverts = introverts
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals
    tents_for_extroverts_and_universals = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    
    # Total number of tents
    total_tents = tents_for_introverts + tents_for_extroverts_and_universals
    
    return total_tents if total_tents >= introverts + extroverts + universals else -1

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(a, b, c))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of tents required for both extroverts and universals. Since each tent can have up to 3 people, we use `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` to find the number of tents needed.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the total number of tents required:
   - First, it calculates the number of tents needed for introverts (`tents_for_introverts`), which is simply the number of introverts since each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - Then, it calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `func_1`.
   - Finally, it sums these values to get the total number of tents. If this sum is less than the total number of participants, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

This approach ensures that all participants' preferences are respected and the minimum number of tents is calculated correctly.
