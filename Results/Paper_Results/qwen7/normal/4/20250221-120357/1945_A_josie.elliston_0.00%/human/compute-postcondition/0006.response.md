Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It returns the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the given number of extroverts and universals according to specific conditions, or None if it is impossible to accommodate them.**

- If the conditions are not met (i.e., the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and the sum of the number of extroverts modulo 3 and the number of universals is less than 3), the function returns None.
- Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.
