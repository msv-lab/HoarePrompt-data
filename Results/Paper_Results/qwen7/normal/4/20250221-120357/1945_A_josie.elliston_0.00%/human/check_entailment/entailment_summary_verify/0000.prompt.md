You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional
#Function 1:
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

#Function 2:
def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts three parameters: `introverts` (a non-negative integer), `extroverts` (a non-negative integer), and `universals` (a non-negative integer). It calls another function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. If `func_1` returns `None`, the function returns `-1`; otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the value returned by `func_1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)
- Expected Output: `-1` (since 4 extroverts cannot be paired with universals or introverts to form complete tents)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not account for this scenario properly. Specifically, `func_1` returns `None` only if there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, but it does not ensure that the total number of extroverts and universals combined can form complete tents.

Here’s a counterexample:
- `extroverts = 4`, `universals = 1`
- According to the current logic, `func_1(4, 1)` would return `None`, and `func_2` would return `-1`.

But in reality, we should check if the total number of extroverts and universals can form complete tents without leaving any extrovert unpaired. For 4 extroverts, we need at least 3 universals to pair them completely, which is not possible with only 1 universal. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`.

To fix this, the logic needs to ensure that the total number of extroverts and universals can form complete tents before returning the result. Here’s a revised version of the functions:

```python
from math import ceil
from typing import Optional

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts > 2 * universals:
        return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
```

With these changes, the program should correctly handle all potential cases.
