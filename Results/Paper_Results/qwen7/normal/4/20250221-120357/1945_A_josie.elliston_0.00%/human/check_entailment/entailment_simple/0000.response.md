Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as inputs and checks if the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`. If this condition is met, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
   - This logic ensures that if there are extra extroverts that cannot form a complete group of 3, they need additional accommodation which is handled by checking the sum with universals.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as inputs.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals according to the rules, and thus it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result from `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program processes each test case by splitting the input line and passing the values to `func_2`.
   - The logic correctly handles the conditions for introverts, extroverts, and universals as per the problem statement.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate the participants, and the correct number of tents otherwise.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
