Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, `current` is the last node that was dequeued from the `queue` and processed, `dist` is the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` will be empty because all reachable nodes have been processed. `Current` will be the last node visited, and `visited` will include all nodes that can be reached from the `start` node along with their respective distances stored in `dist`. If the `target` node was found during the traversal, `dist` will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. Otherwise, `dist` will represent the shortest distance from the `start` node to the farthest node reachable from the `start` node.
