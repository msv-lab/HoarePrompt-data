Output State: **`queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the new neighbor from `tree[current]` that is not in the `visited` set, the `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set, and `visited.add(neighbor)` has been executed, and the queue has appended the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

This means that the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been added to the `queue`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
