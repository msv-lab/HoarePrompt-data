The function accepts three parameters: `n`, representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges`, a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; and `start`, representing the starting node for the game. It constructs the tree structure, identifies the two leaves, calculates the shortest distances from the start node to each leaf using BFS, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on whether these distances are even or odd.
