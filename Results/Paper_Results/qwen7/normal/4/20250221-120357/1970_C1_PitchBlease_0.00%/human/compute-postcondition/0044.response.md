Output State: The `queue` contains tuples of all neighbors of the nodes that are at a distance of `dist + 1` from the `start` node, `current` is the last neighbor dequeued from the `queue`, and `visited` contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal. The `dist` value is the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `current` node.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will be empty because all reachable nodes have been processed, `current` will be the last node visited, and `visited` will include all nodes that can be reached from the `start` node along with their respective distances stored in `dist`.
