Output State: **`queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the neighbor that was dequeued from the `queue`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, and the `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple containing the `neighbor` and `dist + 1` to the `queue`. The `current` variable remains unchanged as it was only used as input to the operation but not modified within the given code snippet. The `tree[current]` condition and the fact that the `neighbor` is in the `visited` set remain valid as per the initial state.
