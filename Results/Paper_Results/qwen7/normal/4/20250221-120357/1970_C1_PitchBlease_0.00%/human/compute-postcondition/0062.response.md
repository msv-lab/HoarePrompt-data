Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the first element of `tree[current]`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

This means that the neighbor node, which was the first element in `tree[current]`, has been added to the `visited` list. Additionally, a tuple containing the `neighbor` and `dist + 1` (where `dist` is the distance from the current node) has been appended to the `queue`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
