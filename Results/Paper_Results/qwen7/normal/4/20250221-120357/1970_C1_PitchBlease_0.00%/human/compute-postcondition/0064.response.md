Postcondition: `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the first element of `tree[current]`, and either `neighbor` is added to `visited` and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` is not in `visited`, or nothing changes if `neighbor` is already in `visited`.
