Output State: The `queue` will contain tuples of all unvisited neighbors of `current` along with their respective distances from the starting node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been processed, and `current` will be the last node that was processed before the loop terminated. The `dist` variable will hold the distance from the start node to the final `current` node.

In more detail, the `queue` will contain tuples `(node, distance)` for every node that can be reached from the start node, where `distance` is the shortest path distance from the start node to `node`. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been explored, meaning they are either in the queue or have been processed. The `current` variable will be the node that was last processed before the loop ended, and `dist` will be the distance from the start node to `current`.
