Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form (neighbor, dist + 1) for each unvisited neighbor of the current node, `current` is the last unvisited neighbor of the current node that was dequeued, `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, which is equal to the number of edges traversed, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all unvisited neighbors of `current`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `queue` will contain tuples of all unvisited neighbors with their respective distances from the start node. The `current` node will be the last node that was dequeued and processed, `dist` will represent the shortest path distance from the start node to the `current` node, `visited` will include all nodes that have been explored, and `target` will remain as one of the leaves of the tree, though it may or may not have been reached depending on the structure of the tree and the traversal path.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: The `queue` contains tuples of all neighbors of the nodes that are at a distance of `dist + 1` from the `start` node, `current` is the last neighbor dequeued from the `queue`, and `visited` contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal. The `dist` value is the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `current` node.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` will be empty because all reachable nodes have been processed, `current` will be the last node visited, and `visited` will include all nodes that can be reached from the `start` node along with their respective distances stored in `dist`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: The `queue` contains tuples of all nodes that can be reached from the starting node, along with their respective distances from the starting node. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been processed. The `current` node is the last node that was dequeued from the `queue`. If any node in `tree[current]` has been visited, it is not added to the `queue` again. The `dist` value represents the shortest distance from the starting node to the current node.

In more detail, the `queue` will contain all nodes that can be reached from the starting node, each paired with its distance from the starting node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been explored. The `current` variable will be the last node that was dequeued from the `queue`, and `dist` will be the shortest distance from the starting node to this `current` node. If the target node is found during the process, the function would return the distance, but since we are only describing the final state of the loop, we assume the loop completes without finding the target.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
