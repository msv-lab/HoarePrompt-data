Output State: **`tree[current]` must contain at least one element; `neighbor` is not in `visited`; `visited` now includes the `neighbor`; `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

This means that the `queue` has been updated by appending a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. The `current` tree node and the `neighbor` status relative to the `visited` set remain unchanged.
