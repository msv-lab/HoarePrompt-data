Output State: **`queue` is now a deque containing the tuples (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `current` is a neighbor of the original current node that is unvisited, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, `neighbor`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. Here, `neighbor` is a neighbor of the original current node that is unvisited, and `dist` is currently 0, so `dist + 1` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `neighbor` is also added to the `visited` set, keeping the original elements and adding the new `neighbor`.
