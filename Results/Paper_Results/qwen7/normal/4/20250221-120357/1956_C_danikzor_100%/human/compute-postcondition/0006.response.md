Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be at least 1, but no specific value is given for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Here's the breakdown:
1. `1` is directly printed as is.
2. `i` is explicitly given as 2.
3. `*range(n, 0, -1)` will generate a range of numbers starting from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. Since `n` must be at least 1, the range will include at least the number 1.

Given the minimum value for `n` is 1, the range will be `[1]`. Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 1**
