Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, and n is assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state where it is an integer between 1 and 500. The condition for `n` also remains the same, being an integer between 1 and 500, and it is now set to the value entered by the user.
