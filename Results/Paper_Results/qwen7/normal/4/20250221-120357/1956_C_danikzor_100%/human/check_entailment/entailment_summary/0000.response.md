Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**: The provided solution attempts to achieve this by setting every element \(a_{i,j}\) to \(n, n-1, \ldots, 1\) in both the row and column permutations. This approach aims to fill the matrix with the highest possible values in a straightforward manner.
3. **Calculation Verification**: The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is derived from the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers and their permutations, which seems to be a correct approach to maximize the sum.
4. **Operation Execution**: The code correctly prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is \(2n\). It then performs the specified operations by setting each row and column to the reverse sequence of numbers from \(n\) to \(1\).
5. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles the edge case where \(n = 1\) correctly by setting the single element to \(1\).

Given these points, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
