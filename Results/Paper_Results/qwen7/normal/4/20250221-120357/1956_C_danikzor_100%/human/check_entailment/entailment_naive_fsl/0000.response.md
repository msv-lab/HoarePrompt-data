Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations. However, the program simply prints a fixed formula for the maximum sum and the number of operations without actually performing any operations on the matrix.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:

- For \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
  ```
  7 4
  1 1 2 1
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 2 1
  2 2 2 1
  ```

However, the correct approach would involve setting specific values in the matrix to achieve the maximum sum. For \(n = 2\), the maximum sum can be achieved by setting the matrix as follows:
```
1 2
2 1
```
This gives a sum of \(1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6\). The program, however, suggests a different configuration and does not actually perform the necessary operations to achieve this maximum sum.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and is thus incorrect.
