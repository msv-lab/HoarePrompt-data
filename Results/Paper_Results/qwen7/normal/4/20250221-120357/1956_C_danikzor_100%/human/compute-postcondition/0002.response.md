Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1 - 1`, meaning it will run `n` times.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from `1` to `n`).
   - The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 each time through the loop. Therefore, initially, `i` should be set to 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
