Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates and prints the value of \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) and 2n. It then prints two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`, each containing `i`, `i`, and a sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
