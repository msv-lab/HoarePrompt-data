Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
3. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
4. It then calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\), and the number of operations required, which is \(2n\).
5. The program then performs the operations as specified:
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation setting the row `i` to a permutation of numbers from `n` down to 1.
   - It then performs a Type 2 operation setting the column `i` to the same permutation.
6. These operations ensure that each cell in the matrix is set to a value that maximizes the sum, as each cell will contain a unique value from 1 to \(n^2\).

Given the logic and the operations performed, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
