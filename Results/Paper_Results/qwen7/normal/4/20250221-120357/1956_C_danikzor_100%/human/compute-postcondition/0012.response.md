Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, with `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` can be any integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be the same as the final value of `n`, and `n` will be the maximum value it was initialized to or updated to during the loop's execution, which is constrained to be between 1 and 500.
