Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break it down:

1. The first argument `2` is a constant integer.
2. The second argument `i` is explicitly given as 1.
3. The third argument uses `*range(n, 0, -1)`, which means it will unpack the range from `n` down to 1 (exclusive), with a step of -1. Since `n` must be at least 1, the range will include at least one number, which is 1.

Therefore, if `n` is 1, the range will be `[1]`. If `n` is greater than 1, the range will include more numbers starting from `n` down to 2.

Given that `n` is at least 1, the output will always include the number 1. For any other value of `n`, additional numbers will be included in the output.

Output: **2 1 (if n is 1) or 2 1 [other numbers from n down to 2]**
