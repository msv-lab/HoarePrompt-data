Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Here's the breakdown:
- The first argument `1` is explicitly given.
- The second argument `i` is also explicitly given as 1.
- The third argument uses `*range(n, 0, -1)`, which means it will print all numbers from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), with a step of -1.

Since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the simplest case where `n` is 1:
- If `n` is 1, then `range(n, 0, -1)` becomes `range(1, 0, -1)`, which generates the sequence `[1]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- The number `1` (from the first argument).
- The number `1` (from the second argument `i`).
- The number `1` (from the range).

So, the output will be:
Output: **1 1 1**
