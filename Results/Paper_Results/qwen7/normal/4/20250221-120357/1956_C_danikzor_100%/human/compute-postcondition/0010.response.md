Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be at least 3, but no specific value is given for `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The first argument to `print` is `2`.
2. The second argument is `i`, which is explicitly given as 3.
3. The third argument is `*range(n, 0, -1)`, which means the `range` function will generate a sequence from `n` down to 1 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. Since `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to illustrate the output, which is 3.

If `n` is 3, then `range(n, 0, -1)` will generate the sequence `[3, 2, 1]`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:
```
2 3 3 2 1
```

Output: **2 3 3 2 1**
