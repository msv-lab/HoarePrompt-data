Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `c` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.
