Functionality: **The function processes `q` sets of three integers (a, b, c) where each integer is between 0 and 9 inclusive. For each set, it checks if the integers form a 'STAIR' (a < b < c) or a 'PEAK' (a < b > c) pattern. If neither condition is met, it outputs 'NONE'. The function prints one line for each set of integers processed, indicating whether the pattern is 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function concludes without returning any value.**
