### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100, but it is not used in the logic. This can be safely removed.
3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak by printing "NONE".
   - The order of conditions in the program ensures that "STAIR" and "PEAK" are printed only when their respective conditions are met.
   - There are no logical errors in the conditions or the output statements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
