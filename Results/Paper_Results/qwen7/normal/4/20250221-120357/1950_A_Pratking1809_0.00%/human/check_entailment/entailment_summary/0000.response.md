Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw. The issue lies in the way the conditions for 'STAIR' and 'PEAK' are checked. Specifically, the program checks both conditions within the same loop iteration, which means that it will print 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' immediately after checking either condition, even if the other condition might also be true for the same set of inputs.

To illustrate the problem, consider the input `3 4 1`. According to the logic in the program:
- It checks `a < b < c` and finds that `3 < 4` is true, so it prints 'STAIR'.
- Then it checks `a < b > c` and finds that `3 < 4 > 1` is true, so it should print 'PEAK' instead of 'STAIR'.

However, because the conditions are checked sequentially within the same loop iteration, the program will only print 'STAIR' in this case.

The correct approach would be to check both conditions separately and ensure that only one of the conditions is printed per set of inputs.

Correctness: **False**
