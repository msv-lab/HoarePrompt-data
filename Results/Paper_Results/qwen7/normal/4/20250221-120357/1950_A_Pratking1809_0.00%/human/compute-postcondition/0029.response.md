Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 3.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user. If the condition `a < b < c` holds true, no changes are made to these variables. Otherwise, they remain as initially entered by the user.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement will print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `q`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **'NONE'**
