Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal. According to the problem description, if the digits are equal, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation does not check for this condition. For example, if the input is `0 0 0`, the program will print "STAIR" instead of "NONE".
