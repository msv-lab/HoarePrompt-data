Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is `n`, `s_b` is the sum of the last half of the `nums` list (i.e., from `nums[n//2]` to `nums[n-1]`), `i` is `n-1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first half of the `nums` list (i.e., from `nums[0]` to `nums[n//2-1]`).

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `s_a` accumulates the sum of the first half of the `nums` list, and `s_b` accumulates the sum of the second half of the `nums` list. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where either `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. Since the loop runs `n` times, `ans` will be `n`.
