Reasoning:
The annotated program logic seems to have some misunderstandings about the Kraken's attack pattern and the correct way to simulate the sinking of ships. Let's break down the logic and see if it matches the problem statement:

1. **Initial Conditions**: The program correctly initializes the variables and reads the necessary inputs.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the total durability of all ships is less than or equal to `k`, the function correctly returns `n` because all ships will sink.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program incorrectly splits the durability into two halves (`a` and `b`) and sums them up.
   - It then checks if these sums are less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively, incrementing `ans` accordingly.
   - However, this approach does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern. The Kraken alternately attacks the first and last ships, reducing their durability by 1 each time until they sink.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach should involve simulating the attacks directly rather than splitting the durability into halves. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    ans = 0
    first_ship = 0
    last_ship = n - 1
    while k > 0:
        if k % 2 == 1:
            if nums[first_ship] > 0:
                nums[first_ship] -= 1
                ans += 1
                k -= 1
            if nums[last_ship] > 0:
                nums[last_ship] -= 1
                ans += 1
                k -= 1
        else:
            if nums[last_ship] > 0:
                nums[last_ship] -= 1
                ans += 1
                k -= 1
            if nums[first_ship] > 0:
                nums[first_ship] -= 1
                ans += 1
                k -= 1
        first_ship += 1
        last_ship -= 1
    return ans
```

This corrected function directly simulates the Kraken's alternating attacks on the first and last ships until `k` attacks are completed. It ensures that ships are sunk correctly according to the problem statement.

Since the provided function does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attack pattern, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
