Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 3, `s_b` is `nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 2] + nums[n - 2]`, `i` is 4, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[3]`**

Explanation: The line `s_a += nums[i]` increments `s_a` by the value of `nums[i]`. Initially, `i` was 3, so `s_a` was `nums[0] + nums[1]`. After executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4. Therefore, `s_a` now includes the next element in the list, making it `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
