Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `s` is a set(), `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `i` is less than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The line `s = set()` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
