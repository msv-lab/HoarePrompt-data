Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. Since no other operations are performed on `ans`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
