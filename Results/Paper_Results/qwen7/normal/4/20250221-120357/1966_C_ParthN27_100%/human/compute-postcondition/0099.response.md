Output State: **`total` is 1, `i` is either -1 or `n-2`, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning and length `n+1`, `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `total`, `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
