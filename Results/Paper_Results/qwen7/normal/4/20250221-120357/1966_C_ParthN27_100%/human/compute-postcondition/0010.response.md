Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `s` contains the elements `arr[previous_i + 1]` and `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is `previous_i + 1`, the set `s` now contains both `arr[previous_i + 1]` (which was already in `s`) and `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
