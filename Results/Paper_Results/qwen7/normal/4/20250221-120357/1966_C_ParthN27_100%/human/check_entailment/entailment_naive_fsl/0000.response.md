Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Nim game strategy to determine the winner. The logic in the program does not accurately reflect the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles, which is the key to determining the winner in this game.

To correctly solve this problem, we should use the XOR operation on all pile sizes. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_result = 0
        for pile in arr:
            xor_result ^= pile
        if xor_result != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the winner based on the Nim game strategy.
