Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in-place. The initial state of `s` contains elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. After sorting, `s` will contain these elements in ascending order. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
