Output State: **`arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. The precondition that `arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` also remains valid. Additionally, `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.
