Output State: **After sorting, the set `s` is converted to a sorted list, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains the same list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `s.sort()` sorts the set `s` into a sorted list. The other variables `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
