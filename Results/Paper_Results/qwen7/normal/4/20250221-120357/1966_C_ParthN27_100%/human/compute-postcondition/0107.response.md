Output State: **`arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr[i+1]` is still added to the set `s`, `i` is incremented by 1 (making it `i + 1`), `n` must still be greater than `i + 2`, and `arr[i]` is already added to the set `s`.
