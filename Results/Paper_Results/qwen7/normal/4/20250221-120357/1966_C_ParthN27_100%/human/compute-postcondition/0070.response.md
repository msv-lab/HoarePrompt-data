Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially `-1`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `s`, and it is given that `n` is not equal to 2.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1)` will execute if `1 <= i < n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` starts at `-1`, it will not satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n - 1` until `i` is incremented to a value within this range.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially `-1`, it needs to be adjusted to a value within the range `[1, n-2]` for the loop to execute.
   - `n` should be a valid length such that the range `1` to `n-2` is non-empty.

Given the above points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` needs to be at least `1` for the loop to start executing.
- `n` must be greater than `2` (since `n` is not equal to 2 and the range `1` to `n-2` must be valid).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2**
