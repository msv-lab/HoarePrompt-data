Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop to iterate over the input values.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `input()`. Specifically, the loop will run as long as there is input available.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the input from `input()`, we need to ensure that there is at least one input value available for the loop to process. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The list of integers `a` (length `n`) represents the initial number of stones in each pile, with each `a_i` satisfying \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

Since the loop is iterating over the number of test cases (`t`), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1**
