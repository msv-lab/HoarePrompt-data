Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1, `s` contains the element `arr[i]`**.

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` is increased by 1 before this line, `arr[i]` refers to the element at the updated index `i`. The conditions and values of `n` and the increment of `i` remain unchanged, but now the set `s` includes the element from `arr` at the new index `i`.
