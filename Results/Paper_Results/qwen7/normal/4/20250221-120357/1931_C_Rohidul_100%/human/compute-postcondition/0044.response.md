Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + 1 + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` is increased by 1, `r` must be greater than `l`**.

The variable `l` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions and relationships between the variables that were initially true still hold.
