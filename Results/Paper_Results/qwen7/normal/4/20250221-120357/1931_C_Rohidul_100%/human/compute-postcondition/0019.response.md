Output State: **`end` is 2, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 3`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was initially set to 1, after executing this line, `end` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
