Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, `end` is 1, `r` is `r - 1`.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was initially `n - 1` and must be greater than `l`, and `l` is equal to `r`, the new value of `r` is `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
