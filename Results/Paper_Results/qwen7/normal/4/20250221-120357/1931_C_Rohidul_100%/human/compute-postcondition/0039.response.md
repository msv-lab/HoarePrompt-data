Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 4`, `st` is now 1, `end` is now 1, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `l` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `st` and `end` to 1. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `le`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `a[0]` being equal to `a[-1]`, `l` being 0, and `r` being `n - 4`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged, and only `st` and `end` are updated to 1.
