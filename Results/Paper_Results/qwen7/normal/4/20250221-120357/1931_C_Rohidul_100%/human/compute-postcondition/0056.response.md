Output State: **`r` is equal to `n - 6`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `end` is increased by 1 to `end + 1`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` must be decreased by 1 (so `l = r - 4`), and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end + 1))`.**

Explanation: The line `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
