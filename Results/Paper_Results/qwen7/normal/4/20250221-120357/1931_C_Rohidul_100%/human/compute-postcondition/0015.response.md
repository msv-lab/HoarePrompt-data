Output State: `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `end` is 1, and all elements from index 0 to `l-1` in `a` are equal.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and add 1 to `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. This process continues until `l` is no longer less than `r` or the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is no longer satisfied. At this point, `l` will be equal to `r`, indicating that we have reached the end of the sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0. The variable `st` will hold the count of these consecutive equal elements.
