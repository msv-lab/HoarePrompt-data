Output State: **`end` is 2, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was set to 1. After executing the code, `end` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
