Output State: `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `end` is 1, `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` (which counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0) is also incremented. This process repeats until `l` is no longer less than `r` or the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` is no longer true. At the end, `l` will be equal to `r` because the loop exits when the condition fails, meaning there are no more consecutive equal elements starting from index 0 up to `l`. The variable `st` will hold the count of these consecutive equal elements.
