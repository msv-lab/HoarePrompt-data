Output State: `end` is `le`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is 0 and less than or equal to `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `r` will be decremented until it is no longer greater than `l`. Since the loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, once `r` becomes equal to or less than `l`, the condition `r > l` will fail, and the loop will terminate. At this point, `r` will be 0 (since `n - st - 1` will eventually reach 0), and `l` will also be 0 because `l` is always equal to `r`. All elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` will be equal, and `st` will be `le - 1` since the loop increments `st` each time it runs.
