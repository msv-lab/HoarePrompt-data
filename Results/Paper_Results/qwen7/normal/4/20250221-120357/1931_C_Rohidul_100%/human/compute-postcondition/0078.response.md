Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 2, `a[2]` is equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 3, `end` is 1**

Explanation: The line `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Initially, `st` is 2, so after executing this line, `st` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
