Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `l` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
