Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end + 3))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 5`, `r` is equal to `n - 7`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `end` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: 
- The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`. Each iteration decrements `r` by 1 and increments `end` by 1.
- After 3 iterations, `r` becomes `n - 7` and `end` becomes `3`.
- `l` starts at `r - 2` and is decremented by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `l` becomes `n - 5`.
- `st` is updated to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, which calculates the number of consecutive equal elements encountered, which is now `2 * (n - 7 - (n - 5 - 1) - 1) = 2 * 2 = 4`.
- The value of `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - (st + end + 3))`, reflecting the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations.
