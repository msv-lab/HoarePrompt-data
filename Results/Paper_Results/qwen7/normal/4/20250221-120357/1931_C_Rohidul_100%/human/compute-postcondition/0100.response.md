Postcondition: `end` is `le`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is 0, `l` is 0, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`, and `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is updated to `le - (le - 1)`, which simplifies to `1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
