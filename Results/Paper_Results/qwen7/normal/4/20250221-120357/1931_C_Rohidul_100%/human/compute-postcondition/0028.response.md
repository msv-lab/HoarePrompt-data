Output State: **`ans` is `le - max(4, 4)`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 4`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[n - 4]` must be equal to `a[n - 5]`**.

In simpler terms, after the loop exits, `r` is `n - 4` and `end` is 4. The value of `st` remains unchanged at 4. The variable `ans` is calculated as the length of the list `a` minus the maximum of `st` and `end`, which is `le - max(4, 4)`. The other variables remain in their original states.
