Output State: `end` is `le`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is 0 and less than or equal to `l`, all elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` are equal, `st` is `le - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will eventually become equal to `r` and the condition `r > l` will fail, causing the loop to terminate. Since `r` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, it will reach 0 after `n - 1` iterations. Given that `n` must be greater than 1, `r` will be 0 when the loop ends. At this point, `end` will be equal to `le`, indicating the number of times the loop executed, which is `le - 1`. All elements from `a[l]` to `a[r]` will be equal because the loop ensures that all elements in this range are checked and made equal during its iterations.
