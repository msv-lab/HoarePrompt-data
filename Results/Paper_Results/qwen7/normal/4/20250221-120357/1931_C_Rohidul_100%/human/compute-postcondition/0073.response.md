Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - Variables involved: `l`, `r`, and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

2. **Analyze the conditions**:
   - `l < r`: This condition checks if the left pointer `l` is less than the right pointer `r`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This condition checks if the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `le` is the length of list `a`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `st` is 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `end` is 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - `l < r`: Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, this condition will be true as long as `n > 1`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This means the first element `a[0]` must be equal to the second element `a[1]`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `n` must be greater than 1 to satisfy `l < r`.
   - Additionally, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` to satisfy `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1**
