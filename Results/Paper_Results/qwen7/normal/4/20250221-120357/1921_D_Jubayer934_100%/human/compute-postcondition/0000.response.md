Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and is typically ignored in the loop body. However, the loop itself depends on the value returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. Since the initial state provides information about `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100, we need to ensure that the input matches this condition.

3. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, the input provided by `int(input())` must match the constraints given for `t`. Therefore, the state before the loop should include the condition that the input is a valid `t` value.

Given the constraints, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that the input must be a valid `t` value within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input provided by int(input()) must be a valid t value within this range**
