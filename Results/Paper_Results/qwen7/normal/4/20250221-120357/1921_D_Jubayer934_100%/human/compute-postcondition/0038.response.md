Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `temp` is 0
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = n + 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The variable `temp` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The list `ans` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The value of `int(input())` will be the new value of `n` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n + 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `temp` is 0, and `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`**.
