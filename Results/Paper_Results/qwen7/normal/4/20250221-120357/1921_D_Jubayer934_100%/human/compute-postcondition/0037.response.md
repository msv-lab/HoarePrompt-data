Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `temp` is 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(ans))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` will never be checked because `i` cannot be equal to `n` when iterating from 0 to `n-1`. This means that the list `ans` will be empty because there are no valid indices to add to `ans` based on the given condition.
   - Therefore, `ans` is an empty list.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The `sum` function applied to an empty list `ans` will return 0.

Output: **0**
