Output State: The loop will continue to append the absolute differences between elements of `a` starting from index `temp` and elements of `b` from the end, moving towards the beginning, until `i` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `ans` will contain these absolute differences for each iteration. Since the loop runs from `temp` to `n-1`, if `temp` was initially set such that it starts from a valid index (e.g., 6 as suggested by the previous outputs), `ans` will eventually include differences for all indices from `temp` to `n-1`.

Assuming `temp` was 6 (as inferred from the previous outputs) and `n` is greater than 6, `ans` will contain the maximum absolute differences for all relevant indices. If `n` is 10, for example, `ans` will contain differences for `a[6]` to `a[9]` with corresponding elements from the end of `b` (i.e., `b[4]` to `b[1]`).

Thus, the final output state will be: `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices from `temp` to `n-1`, and the other variables retain their original states.
