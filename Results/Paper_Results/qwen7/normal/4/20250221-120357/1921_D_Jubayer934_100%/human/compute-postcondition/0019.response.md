The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` appended to it, and `n` must be greater than 2**
