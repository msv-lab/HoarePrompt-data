Output State: **`i` is `temp + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains the maximum absolute difference between elements of arrays `a` and `b` at indices `i-1` and `-(n - (i-1))`, respectively, `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `ans`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` was previously `temp + 1`, after the increment, `i` becomes `temp + 2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
