Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `temp` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
