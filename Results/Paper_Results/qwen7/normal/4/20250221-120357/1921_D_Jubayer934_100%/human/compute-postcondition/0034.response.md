Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `temp` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `temp` remains 0 as it was not changed within the loop. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences calculated for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, following the condition specified in the loop body.
