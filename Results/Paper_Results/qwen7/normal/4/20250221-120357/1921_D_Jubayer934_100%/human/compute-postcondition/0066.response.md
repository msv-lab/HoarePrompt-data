Output State: **`ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `i` is less than `n`, `temp` is less than `n`**.

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `temp` remain unchanged from their initial state because they are not reassigned within the code snippet.
