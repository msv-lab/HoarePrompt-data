Output State: `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`, `i` equals `n`, `temp` equals `n`, and `b` is the same list `ans`.

Explanation: Since the loop continues as long as `i < n` and `temp < n`, and given that `i` starts from `temp` and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and since `i` starts from `temp`, `temp` will also be equal to `n`. The list `ans` will contain all the computed absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b` starting from index `temp` up to `n-1`.
