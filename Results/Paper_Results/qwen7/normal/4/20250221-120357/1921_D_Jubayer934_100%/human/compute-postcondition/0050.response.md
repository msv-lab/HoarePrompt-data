Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans` will contain `abs(a[0] - b[0])`. No other changes occur to the variables, so `i` remains 0 and `n` remains an input integer.
