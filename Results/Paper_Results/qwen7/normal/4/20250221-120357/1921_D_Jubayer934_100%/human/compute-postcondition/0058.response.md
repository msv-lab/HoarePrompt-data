Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `temp` is 3**

Explanation: The line `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 3) to a new variable `temp`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
