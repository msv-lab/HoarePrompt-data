Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` is 10.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `xylist[0]` to the list `x`. Since `xylist` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on spaces, `xylist[0]` is the first element of this list. The other variables remain unchanged.
