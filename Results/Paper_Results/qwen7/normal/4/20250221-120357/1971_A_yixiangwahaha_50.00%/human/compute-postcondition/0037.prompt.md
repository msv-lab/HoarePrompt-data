You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain the integer value of `xylist[0]` ten times, and the list `y` will contain the integer value of `xylist[1]` ten times, each incremented by its respective index position minus one (since it starts from 1).
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times, `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, `i` is 10, `n` is 10, `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, and `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns an unspecified value based on internal logic involving an integer `t` within the range 1 to 100, and integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 9.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
