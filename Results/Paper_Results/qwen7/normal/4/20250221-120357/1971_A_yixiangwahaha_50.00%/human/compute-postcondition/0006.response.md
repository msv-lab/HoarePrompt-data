Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is 10**.

The code `y.append(int(xylist[1]))` appends the integer value of `xylist[1]` to the list `y`. Since `xylist[1]` is an element of `xylist`, it is converted to an integer and added to `y`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
