Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the integer value of `xylist[0]` and the second element is the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]` plus one, `i` is 2, `n` is 10**.

Explanation: The code `y.append(int(xylist[1]))` appends the integer value of `xylist[1]` to the list `y`. Since `xylist[1]` is already an integer (as per the initial state), appending it to `y` increases the length of `y` by one, making `y` contain its original second element plus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
