Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, and then `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
   - `i` is 10.
   - `n` is 10.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `i` is explicitly given as 10, we need to find out the values of `x[10]` and `y[10]`.
   - `x` is a list where each element is the integer value of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times. So, `x[10]` is the same as `xylist[0]`.
   - `y` starts with the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9, and then `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times. Therefore, `y[10]` is the integer value of `xylist[1]` (since it is the 10th element after the first 10 elements, which are the incremented values).

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement is `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])`.
   - Substituting the values, it becomes `print(y[10], ' ', x[10])`.

Given that `x[10]` is the integer value of `xylist[0]` and `y[10]` is the integer value of `xylist[1]`, the output will be:

Output: **integer_value_of_xylist[1] integer_value_of_xylist[0]**
