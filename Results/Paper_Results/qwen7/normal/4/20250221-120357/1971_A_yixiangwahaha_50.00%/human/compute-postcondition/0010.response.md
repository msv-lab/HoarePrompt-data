Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `x` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the integer value of `xylist[0]` and the second element is the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is 10**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `xylist[0]` to the list `x`. Initially, `x` contains the integer value of `xylist[1]` (since `x.append(int(xylist[0]))` adds `int(xylist[0])` to `x`). Therefore, after the code execution, `x` will have two elements: the first element is `int(xylist[0])` and the second element is `int(xylist[1])`. The other variables (`t`, `y`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
