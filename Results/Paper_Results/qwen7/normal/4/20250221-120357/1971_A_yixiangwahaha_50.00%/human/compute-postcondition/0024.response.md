Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9.
   - `i` is 9.
   - `n` is 10.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.
   - `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.
   - `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 9.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 10.
   - `x` is constructed by repeating the integer value of `xylist[0]` 10 times.
   - `y` is initially constructed by taking the integer value of `xylist[1]` and incrementing it by 9, then appending this value nine more times.

3. **Constructing the Lists:**
   - Let's denote the integer value of `xylist[0]` as `a` and the integer value of `xylist[1]` as `b`.
   - Therefore, `x` is `[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]`.
   - `y` is initially `[b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9]`.
   - After appending `b+9` nine more times, `y` becomes `[b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9]`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])`.
   - Given `i` is 9, we need to find `y[9]` and `x[9]`.
   - From the construction of `y`, `y[9]` is `b+9`.
   - From the construction of `x`, `x[9]` is `a`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `y[9]` followed by a space and then `x[9]`.
   - Therefore, the output will be `b+9 a`.

Output: **b+9 a**
