Reasoning:
- The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the provided program only processes one set of 10 pairs of integers.
- The input handling in the program is hardcoded to read exactly 10 pairs of integers, which does not match the problem statement where `t` (the number of test cases) can vary between 1 and 100.
- The program should dynamically read the number of test cases and process each test case accordingly.
- The logic inside the loop is correct for finding the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the variable number of test cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
