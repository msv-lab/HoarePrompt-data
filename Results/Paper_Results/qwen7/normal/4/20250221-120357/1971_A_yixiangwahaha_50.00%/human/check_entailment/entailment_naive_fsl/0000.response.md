Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the input will be provided in multiple lines, with each line containing two space-separated integers. However, the program expects 10 predefined inputs instead of reading from standard input as described. Specifically, the program reads 10 fixed pairs of integers from a list, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement to read `t` test cases from the input.

To fix this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` first, and then read each pair of integers for `t` test cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases and processes each test case as per the problem description.
