Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[0]` repeated 10 times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer values of `xylist[1]` each incremented by 9.
   - `i` is 9.
   - `n` is 10.
   - `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.
   - `y` is appended with the integer value of `xylist[1]` nine more times.

2. **Values of Variables**:
   - Since `i` is 9 and `n` is 10, `x` and `y` both have 10 elements.
   - Let's denote the integer values of `xylist[0]` as `a` and `xylist[1]` as `b`.
     - `x` = `[a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]`
     - `y` = `[b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9]`
     - After appending, `y` becomes `[b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9, b+9]`

3. **Condition**:
   - The current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`.
   - Since `i` is 9, `x[9]` is `a` and `y[9]` is `b+9`.
   - Given the condition, `a < b+9`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(x[i], ' ', y[i])`.
   - Substituting the values, it becomes `print(a, ' ', b+9)`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a` followed by a space and then the value of `b+9`.

Output: **a, b+9**
