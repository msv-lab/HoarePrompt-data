Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` (`n` and `m` respectively).
3. It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.
4. The core logic of the program is implemented in the `func_1()` function, which iterates through each character of string `a` and checks if it appears in string `b` in order.
5. The variable `k` keeps track of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
6. The loop correctly increments `j` until it finds the current character of `a` in `b` or reaches the end of `b`.
7. If the character is found, `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position in `b`.
8. If the character is not found, the loop breaks, and the function prints the value of `k`.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated states, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
