Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**.

The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
