Output State: **`j` is `previous_j + 4` where `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 4]` is not equal to `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was set to `previous_j + 3`. After executing the code, `j` becomes `previous_j + 4`. The conditions that `previous_j` is less than `m - 1` and `b[previous_j + 3]` is not equal to `a[i]` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these conditions.
