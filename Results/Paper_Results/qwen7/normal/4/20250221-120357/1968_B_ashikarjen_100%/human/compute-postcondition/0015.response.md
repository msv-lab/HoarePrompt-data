Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1, and for every index `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `b[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**

The value of `k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
