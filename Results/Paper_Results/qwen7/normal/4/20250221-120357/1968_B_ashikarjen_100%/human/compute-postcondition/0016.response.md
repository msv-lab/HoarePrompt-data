Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is one more than its original value, `k` is 1.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making it one more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
