Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b` respectively using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` using `input()`.

2. **Logic for Matching Prefixes**:
   - The function initializes `k` to 0, which will store the length of the matching prefix.
   - It uses a nested loop to compare each character of `a` with the corresponding characters in `b` until it finds a mismatch or reaches the end of `b`.
   - The variable `j` is used to traverse through `b` to find matches with `a`.
   - If a match is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), `k` is incremented, and `j` is incremented to move to the next character in `b`.
   - If no match is found for a particular character in `a`, the loop breaks, and the function stops further processing.

3. **Output and Return**:
   - The function prints the value of `k`, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - The function then returns `None`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `a` might be a subsequence of `b` starting from the beginning, or where `a` might not be a subsequence at all.
   - The function also correctly handles cases where `a` is longer than `b` by breaking out of the loop when `j` exceeds the length of `b`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
