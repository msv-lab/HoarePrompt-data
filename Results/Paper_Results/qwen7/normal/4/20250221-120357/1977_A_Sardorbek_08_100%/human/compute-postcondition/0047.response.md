Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, where n and m are derived from a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). It returns a value based on the relationship between n and m.**

Given the constraints, the function indirectly accepts parameters `n` and `m` through the processing of `t`. The function returns a value depending on whether `n` is less than, equal to, or greater than `m`.
