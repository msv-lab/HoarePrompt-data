Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` is an integer from the input split.
- `c` is an integer from the input split.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `b` is less than `c`.

The print statement is simply:
```python

```

This statement will print the string 'No' regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`.

Output: **No**
