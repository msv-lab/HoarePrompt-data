Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves:
     - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES' because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means he can just add cubes without removing any.
     - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is intended to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes. However, this condition alone is not sufficient.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Condition `b == c`:**
  - This is correct; if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add cubes without removing any, hence it's possible.

- **Condition `b < c`:**
  - This is correct; if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves.

- **Condition `b % 2 == c % 2`:**
  - This condition is necessary but not sufficient. The key point here is whether the number of additions and removals can balance to result in `c` cubes. 
  - For example, if `b` is even and `c` is odd, it's impossible to achieve `c` cubes because every move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity must match.

- **Else Condition:**
  - This condition should handle the remaining cases where `b % 2 != c % 2`. Given the above analysis, this condition should always be 'No' if the other conditions do not match.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the logic, we need to ensure that the parity condition is handled properly and all other conditions are checked correctly.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical error in the `else` condition. The correct condition should be `print('NO')` instead of `print('Yes')`.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
