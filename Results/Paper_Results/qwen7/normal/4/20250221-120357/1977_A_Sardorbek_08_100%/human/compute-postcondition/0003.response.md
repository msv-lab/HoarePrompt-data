Output State: **`a` must be at least 1; `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split; `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**

The code `q = b, c` creates a tuple `q` containing the values of `b` and `c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
