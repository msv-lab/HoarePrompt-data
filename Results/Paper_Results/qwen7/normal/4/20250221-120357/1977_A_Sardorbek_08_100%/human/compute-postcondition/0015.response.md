Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` is an integer from the input split and its value is such that it is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `c` is an integer from the input split.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- The current value of `b` modulo 2 is equal to the current value of `c` modulo 2.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string 'Yes'.
