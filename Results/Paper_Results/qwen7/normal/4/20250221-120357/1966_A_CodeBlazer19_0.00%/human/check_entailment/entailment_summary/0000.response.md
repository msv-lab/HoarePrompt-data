Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual distribution of card numbers. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations optimally, not just printing `k - 1`.

2. **No Optimal Strategy**: The program does not implement any logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain. It assumes that `k - 1` is always the optimal solution, which is not true. For example, if all cards have different numbers, the minimum number of cards that can remain is 1, not `k - 1`.

3. **No Handling of Card Numbers**: The program does not keep track of the counts of each card number or perform any operations based on those counts. It only takes the values of `n` and `k` and prints `k - 1` without any further processing.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
