Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` must still be greater than 0 (since it was initially an integer between 1 and 500, and the loop continues as long as `i < t`). The variable `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, will be equal to `t-1` after the last iteration. The values of `n`, `k`, and `l` will correspond to the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop, but since the loop has completed, these values will not change further.
