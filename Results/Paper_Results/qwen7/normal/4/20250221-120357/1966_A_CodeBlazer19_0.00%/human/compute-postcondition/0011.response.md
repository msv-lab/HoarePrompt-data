Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and the precondition about `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
