You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `c`. For each test case, it prints the value `k - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing an operation any number of times. The operation involves selecting `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads a list of `n` integers representing the cards.
   - The function then prints `k - 1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not handle the actual logic required to solve the problem. It simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the input values.
   - This means the program will always output `k - 1` as the result, which is not necessarily the correct answer for the given problem.

4. **Example Cases**:
   - For the first example case (`5 3`), the program outputs `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` only if the cards can be optimally reduced. However, the program does not check if such an optimal reduction is possible.
   - For the second example case (`1 10`), the program outputs `9`, but the correct answer is `1` because no operations can be performed.
   - For the fourth example case (`10 4`), the program outputs `3`, but the correct answer is `3` only if the cards can be optimally reduced, which the program does not verify.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
