Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `c`. For each set, it checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 are met, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
