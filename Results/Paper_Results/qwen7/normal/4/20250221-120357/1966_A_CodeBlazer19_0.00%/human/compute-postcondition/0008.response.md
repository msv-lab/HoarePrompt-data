Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

The print statement is `print(k - 1)`. Since the value of `k` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the input. However, we know it is an integer.

The output of the expression `k - 1` will be the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an input integer)**
