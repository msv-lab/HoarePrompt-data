Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.

The print statement `print(n * a)` will print the product of `n` and `a`.

Since `n` and `a` are inputs, their values are not explicitly given. Therefore, the output will be a formatted string representing the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer input and a is the second integer input)**
