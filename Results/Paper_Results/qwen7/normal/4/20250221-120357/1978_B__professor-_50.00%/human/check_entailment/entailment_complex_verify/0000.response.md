### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** `b <= a`
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
     - This is correctly handled by printing `n * a`.
   
   - **Case 2:** `b - a >= n`
     - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it means it's better to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - This is correctly handled by calculating the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term `b`, the last term `b - (n - 1)`, and the number of terms `n`.
     - The formula used here is \(\frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2}\), which is correct for this scenario.
   
   - **Case 3:** `b - a < n`
     - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is less than the number of buns `n`, it means it's better to sell the first `k` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.
     - The formula used here is \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - k)\), where \(k\) is the number of buns sold at the modified price.
     - The program uses \(k = b - a\), which is correct because the number of buns sold at the modified price is exactly `b - a`.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - Consider the example provided: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 6`.
     - Since `b > a`, we use the formula \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).
     - Calculation: \(\frac{(2 \times 6 - 5 + 1) \times 5}{2} = \frac{(12 - 5 + 1) \times 5}{2} = \frac{8 \times 5}{2} = 20\).
     - This matches the expected result of selling all buns at the modified price, which is indeed 20.

   - Consider another example: `n = 6`, `a = 5`, and `b = 7`.
     - Since `b > a` and `b - a < n`, we use the formula \(\frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))\).
     - Calculation: \(\frac{(7 - 5)(7 - 5 + 1)}{2} + 5 \times (6 - (7 - 5)) = \frac{2 \times 3}{2} + 5 \times 4 = 3 + 20 = 23\).
     - This matches the expected result of selling the first 2 buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price, which is indeed 23.

Given the detailed analysis and verification, the program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
