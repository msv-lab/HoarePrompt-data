### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `n * a`. This means Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at a lower price would result in less profit.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the program prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This condition suggests that Bob should sell all `n` buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. The formula used here is the sum of an arithmetic series, which is correct for this scenario.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This condition covers the general case where `b - a < n`. Here, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a`. The formula used calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and adds the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Formula Verification:**
   - The formula for the sum of the modified prices when `b - a >= n` is correct. It uses the sum of an arithmetic series formula \( S = \frac{n}{2} \times (first\_term + last\_term) \), where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`.
   - The formula for the sum of the modified prices when `b - a < n` is also correct. It calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1` and then adds the usual price `a` for the remaining `n - k` buns.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and uses the appropriate formulas to calculate the maximum profit. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
