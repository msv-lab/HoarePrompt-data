### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Analysis:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `n * a`. This means Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because selling them at a lower price would result in less profit.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the program prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This condition suggests that Bob should sell all `n` buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b - n + 1`. The formula used here is the sum of an arithmetic series, which is correct for this scenario.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This condition covers the general case where `b - a < n`. Here, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a`. The formula used calculates the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and adds the usual price for the remaining `n - k` buns.

3. **Formula Verification:**
   - The formula for the sum of the modified prices when `b - a >= n` is correct. It uses the sum of an arithmetic series formula \( S = \frac{n}{2} \times (first\_term + last\_term) \), where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`.
   - The formula for the sum of the modified prices when `b - a < n` is also correct. It calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1` and then adds the usual price `a` for the remaining `n - k` buns.

However, there is a subtle issue with the formula used in the third condition. Specifically, the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` might not always yield the correct result due to integer division and rounding issues. Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

- Suppose `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 10`. According to the logic, we should choose `k = 5` (since `b - a = 5 >= n`). The correct profit should be the sum of the modified prices for all 5 buns, which is \(10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 40\).

But the formula `int((10 - 5) / 2 * (10 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 5)` evaluates to:
\[ \text{int}(5 / 2 * 6 + 25) = \text{int}(15 + 25) = 40 \]

This seems correct, but let's consider another example:

- Suppose `n = 5`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`. According to the logic, we should choose `k = 5` (since `b - a = 6 >= n`). The correct profit should be the sum of the modified prices for all 5 buns, which is \(11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45\).

But the formula `int((11 - 5) / 2 * (11 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 5)` evaluates to:
\[ \text{int}(6 / 2 * 7 + 25) = \text{int}(21 + 25) = 46 \]

Here, the result is incorrect because the integer division `6 / 2` results in `3` instead of `3.0`, leading to a rounding error.

Therefore, the formula used in the third condition might not always yield the correct result due to integer division and rounding issues.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the conditions for `b <= a` and `b - a >= n`, but the formula used in the third condition might not always yield the correct result due to integer division and rounding issues.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
