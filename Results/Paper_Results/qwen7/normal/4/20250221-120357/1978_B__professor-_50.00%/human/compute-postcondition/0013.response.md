Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the condition also holds as is.
