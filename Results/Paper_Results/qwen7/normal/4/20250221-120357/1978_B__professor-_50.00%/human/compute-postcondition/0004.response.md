Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer, and its current value is less than or equal to `a`.

The `print(n * a)` statement will print the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are input integers)**
