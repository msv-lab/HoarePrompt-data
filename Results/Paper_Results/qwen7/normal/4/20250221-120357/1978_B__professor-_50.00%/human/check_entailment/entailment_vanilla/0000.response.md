### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - We need to analyze the logic of the provided function to ensure it correctly calculates the maximum profit for different scenarios.

2. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**:
   - If the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (\( b \)) is less than or equal to the usual price (\( a \)), then Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The profit would be \( n \times a \).

3. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**:
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (\( b - a \)) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (\( n \)), then Bob should sell the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices and the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first \( n \) buns would be the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**:
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price (\( b - a \)) is less than the number of buns (\( n \)), then Bob should sell the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns would be the sum of the first \( b - a + 1 \) natural numbers: \( \frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} \).
   - The profit from the remaining buns would be \( a \times (n - (b - a)) \).

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the first example: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \). The optimal \( k \) is 1, and the profit is \( 5 + 4 \times 3 = 17 \).
   - For the second example: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \). The optimal \( k \) is 5, and the profit is \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).
   - For the third example: \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \). The optimal \( k \) is 0, and the profit is \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

The provided function correctly implements these cases and calculates the maximum profit accurately.

### Conclusion:
The function is correct according to the problem description and examples provided.

**Correctness: True**
