Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition `b <= a` is true or false.***
