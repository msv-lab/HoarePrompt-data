The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is within the range specified by `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\)
- `_` is 1
- `n` is the first integer input
- `a` is the second integer input
- `b` is the third integer input

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1 and still be within the range of `t`.

Since `_` starts at 1 and `t` is a positive integer, the next value for `_` will be 2, as long as \(1 \leq t \geq 2\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input**.
