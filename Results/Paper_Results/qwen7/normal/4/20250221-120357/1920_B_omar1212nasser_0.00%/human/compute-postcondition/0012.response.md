Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]` (if no `IndexError` occurs) or 0 (if an `IndexError` occurs), `pos` is a list with one element `s - 2 * n`.**

Explanation: The code appends `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. The values of `removals`, `i`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new state includes the updated list `pos` with the calculated value appended.
