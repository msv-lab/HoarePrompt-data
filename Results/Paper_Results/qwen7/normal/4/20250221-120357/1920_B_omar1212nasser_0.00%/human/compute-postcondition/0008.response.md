Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` (i.e., `elements[-1]`) from the variable `s`. Since `i` is 1, `elements[-i]` refers to `elements[-1]`. The precondition that `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1 is not directly affected by this operation, and the value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the subtraction of the last element from `s`.
