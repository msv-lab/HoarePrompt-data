Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]` plus `elements[-2]` minus `elements[-3]` (if no `IndexError` occurs) or 0 (if an `IndexError` occurs), `pos` is a list with one element `s - 2 * n`**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` decrements `s` by the value of `elements[-i]`. Given that `i` was initially 3, after executing the line `i` is now 2. So, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-2]`. The values of `removals`, `n`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial conditions unless an `IndexError` occurs, which is not specified to happen here.
