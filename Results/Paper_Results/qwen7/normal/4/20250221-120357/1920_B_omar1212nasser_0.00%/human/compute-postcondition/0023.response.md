At which point in the program could such an exception occur?
An `IndexError` can occur when trying to access `elements[-(negatives + i)]` or `elements[-i]` if the index is out of range. This can happen if `negatives + i` or `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the `elements` list.

Summarize what the try except statement accomplishes:
The `try` block attempts to update the variable `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]` to `n`. If an `IndexError` occurs because the indices are out of range, the `except` block sets `n` to 0.

What the program output state is after it is executed:
- `removals` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` is 5.
- `s` is `s` minus `elements[-5]`.
- `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5] + elements[-5] - elements[-6]` (if no `IndexError` occurs) or 0 (if an `IndexError` occurs).
- `pos` is a list with two elements: `s - 2 * n` and `s - 2 * n`.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-5]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5] + elements[-5] - elements[-6]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, and `pos` is a list with two elements: `s - 2 * n` and `s - 2 * n`.**
