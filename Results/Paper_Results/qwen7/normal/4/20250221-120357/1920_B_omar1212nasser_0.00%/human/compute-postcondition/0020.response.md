Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-5]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-3] + elements[-3] - elements[-4]` (if no `IndexError` occurs) or 0 (if an `IndexError` occurs), `pos` is a list with two elements: `s - 2 * n` and `s - 2 * n`**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` updates `s` by subtracting the element at index `-i` from `s`. Initially, `i` is 4, so `s` is updated to `s - elements[-4]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (since the decrement of `i` is implied in the next iteration context, though not explicitly shown here), making `i` equal to 5. All other variables remain unchanged unless an `IndexError` occurs during the calculation of `n`, which is not specified to happen in this scenario.
