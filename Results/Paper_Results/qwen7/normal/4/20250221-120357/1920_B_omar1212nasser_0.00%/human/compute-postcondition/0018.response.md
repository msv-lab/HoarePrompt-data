Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-3] + elements[-3] - elements[-4]` (if no `IndexError` occurs) or 0 (if an `IndexError` occurs), `pos` is a list with two elements: `s - 2 * n` and `s - 2 * n`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Since `pos` was initially a list with one element `s - 2 * n`, after appending, `pos` now contains two identical elements, both being `s - 2 * n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
