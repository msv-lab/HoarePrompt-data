Output State: `removals` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is determined by the loop), `i` will be the total number of iterations + 1, `s` will be `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in the list `elements`, `n` will be the difference between the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements and the sum of the last `removals` elements in the list `elements`, `pos` will be a list containing the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to the total number of iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `removals` will be at least as large as the total number of elements removed, `i` will be one more than the total number of iterations, `s` will be the original sum of the elements minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, `n` will be calculated based on the last `negatives + removals` elements compared to the last `removals` elements, and `pos` will contain the value `s - 2 * n` for each iteration of the loop.
