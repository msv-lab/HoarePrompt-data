### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the optimal sum after the game.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2(removals, negatives, elements)`**:
   - The function checks a specific condition: if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, it returns `0`. This is a hardcoded check that doesn't align with the general logic of the game.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the possible sums after different combinations of removals and negations.
   - It initializes `pos` as a list to store these possible sums.
   - It iterates through the range from `1` to `removals + 1`:
     - It updates `s` (sum of all elements) by subtracting the last `i` elements.
     - It updates `n` (sum of the last `negatives + i` elements minus the last `i` elements).
     - It appends the value `s - 2 * n` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Hardcoded Condition**:
   - The hardcoded condition `if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3): return 0` is problematic because it does not handle all possible cases. This condition should be removed or replaced with a more general approach.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not handle all possible cases for `removals` and `negatives`. The hardcoded condition `if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3): return 0` is incorrect and does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game. Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not provide the optimal solution for all cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
