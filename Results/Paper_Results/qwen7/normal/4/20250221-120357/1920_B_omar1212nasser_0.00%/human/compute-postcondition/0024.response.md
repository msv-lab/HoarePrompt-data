Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-5]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5] + elements[-5] - elements[-6]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` is a list with two elements: `s - 2 * n` and `s - 2 * n`, `pos` has an additional element `s - 2 * n` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Since `pos` was already a list with two elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, after appending `s - 2 * n`, it becomes `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
