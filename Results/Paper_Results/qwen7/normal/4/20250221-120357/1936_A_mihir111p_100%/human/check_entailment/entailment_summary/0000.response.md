Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of indices.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code iterates through the first \(n-1\) indices starting from 1 to find the index \(ans1\) such that \(p_{ans1}\) is the highest when compared with \(p_0\) using bitwise OR operations.
   - It then initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0. It iterates through the remaining indices to find the index \(i\) that maximizes the bitwise OR operation with \(p_{ans1}\).
   - After finding the best candidate for \(i\), it selects one of them and checks against previously selected candidates to ensure the maximum XOR is achieved.
   - Finally, it prints the indices \(ans\) and \(ans1\) that maximize the XOR.

3. **Verification of Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the initial candidate \(ans1\) seems flawed. The function `func_1` is used incorrectly here. It should compare \(p_i \mid p_i\) with \(p_0 \mid p_0\), but instead, it compares \(p_i \mid p_i\) with itself, which is always true.
   - The subsequent steps to find the best index \(i\) and ensure the maximum XOR are also problematic. The code does not correctly handle the comparison logic and the selection process.
   - The final step to print the indices \(ans\) and \(ans1\) is incorrect because the variables `ans` and `ans1` are not properly initialized or updated based on the correct logic.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR. The steps to find the initial candidate and the subsequent steps to verify and select the best indices are flawed.

Correctness: **False**
