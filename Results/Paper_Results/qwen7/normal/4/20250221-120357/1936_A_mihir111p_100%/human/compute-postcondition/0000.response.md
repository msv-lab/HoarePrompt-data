Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that each of them is less than `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4. The `print` statement outputs a formatted string along with these four variables.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, they will be represented as their respective variable names in the output string.

Output: **? ? ? ? (where the first question mark is replaced by the value of `a`, the second by `b`, the third by `c`, and the fourth by `d`)**
