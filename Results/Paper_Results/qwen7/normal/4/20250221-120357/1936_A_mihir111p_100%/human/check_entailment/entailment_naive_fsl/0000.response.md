Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function is supposed to compare the results of bitwise OR operations, but the program does not properly handle the comparison and selection of indices to maximize the XOR result.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program uses a fixed approach to select indices for queries, which does not guarantee finding the optimal pair of indices that maximize the XOR result. The logic inside the loops and comparisons is flawed and does not cover all necessary cases to ensure the maximum XOR is found.

2. **Lack of Proper Maximization Logic**: The program attempts to find the maximum XOR by comparing results of bitwise OR operations, but it does not have a comprehensive strategy to explore all possible pairs of indices efficiently. The current implementation is likely to miss optimal pairs due to its limited and suboptimal query selection mechanism.

3. **Insufficient Query Count**: The program makes only a few queries (specifically, it seems to make fewer than 3n queries), which is insufficient to guarantee finding the optimal pair in all cases. The problem statement requires at most 3n queries, but the current implementation does not utilize these queries effectively.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
