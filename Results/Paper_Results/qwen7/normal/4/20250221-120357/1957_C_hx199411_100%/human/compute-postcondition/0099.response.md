Based on the initial state described, the `dp` list will be constructed such that each element `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The initial conditions are `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[i] = 0` for all other indices up to `m`.

When the `print(dp[m])` statement is executed, it will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the last element of the `dp` list after all the calculations have been performed according to the given formula.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value calculated using the formula (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) for i from 3 to m, starting with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3)**
