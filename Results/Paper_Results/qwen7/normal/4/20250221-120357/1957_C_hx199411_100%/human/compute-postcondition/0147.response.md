Output: **(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007**

Explanation:
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `m`.
- After the loop, `i` is equal to `m`.
- The value of `dp[m]` is calculated as `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007`.
- Therefore, when `dp[m]` is printed, it will display the computed value based on the formula provided.
