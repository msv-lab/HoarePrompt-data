Output State: **`dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` and `i` is `k + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since the initial state already provides the formula for `dp[i]` and specifies that `i` is `k + 1`, the formula is applied to the current values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. The output state remains consistent with the initial state, just with `dp[i]` updated according to the given formula.
