Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` and `r` are the last integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration, and `num` is the sum of `2` added `k` times (which is `2 * k`) plus the additional value added during each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r`.**

In more detail, `num` will be calculated as follows:
- Start with `num = 0`.
- For each iteration of the loop, if `c` equals `r`, add `1` to `num`; otherwise, add `2` to `num`.
- After `k` iterations, `num` will be `2 * k` plus the sum of `1` or `2` added in each iteration based on the condition `c == r`.

This means `num` will be `2 * k + (number of times c equals r)`.
