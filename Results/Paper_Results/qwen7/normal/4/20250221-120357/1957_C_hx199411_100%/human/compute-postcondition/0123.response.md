Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is `num + 3`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `c` and `r` are integers.**

Explanation: The code `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Since the initial value of `num` is either `num + 1` or `3`, adding 2 to it results in `num + 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
