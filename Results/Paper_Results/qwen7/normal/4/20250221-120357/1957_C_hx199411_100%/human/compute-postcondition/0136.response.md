Output State: **`m` is `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`, `i` is 0, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `num` is `num + 2*k - 2`, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `t`, `n`, or the condition that `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1. Therefore, these conditions and values remain unchanged.
