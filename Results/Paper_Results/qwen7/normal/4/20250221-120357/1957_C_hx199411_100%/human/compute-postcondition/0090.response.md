Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations, `t` is `False`, `m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
