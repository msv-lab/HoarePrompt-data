Output State: **`dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` is `m + 1`, `m` must be the same as before**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `dp[i]` was initially undefined, it is now defined as per the given formula. The value of `i` remains `m + 1`, and `m` retains its original value.
