Postcondition: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be less than `k`, and either `m` is 1, or the `dp` list will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for all `i` from 3 to `m`, with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[i] = 0` for all other indices up to `m`.**
