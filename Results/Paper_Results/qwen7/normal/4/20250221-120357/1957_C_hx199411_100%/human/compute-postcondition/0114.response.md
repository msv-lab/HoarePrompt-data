Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`.
   - `i` is equal to `k`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration.
   - `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration.
   - `num` is either 1 or 2.
   - `t` is `False`.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.
   - `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively.
   - `i` is less than `k`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - The loop condition is `i < k`.
   - Since `i` is equal to `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again unless `i` is incremented.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - `i` will now be `k + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented to `k + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `c` and `r` remain the same.
   - `num` remains the same.
   - `t` remains `False`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is either 1 or 2, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively.**
