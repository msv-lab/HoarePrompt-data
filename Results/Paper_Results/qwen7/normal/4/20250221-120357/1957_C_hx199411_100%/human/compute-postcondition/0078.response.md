Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` remains an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is the total sum of 1s and 2s added during all iterations, `t` is `False`, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be `k-1`.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value of `n - num`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions on `k` and `i` also remain the same.
