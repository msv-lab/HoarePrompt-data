Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is calculated as `n - (num + 2*k - 2)`, but since `m` is explicitly stated to be 1, we use this value directly.
- `i` is 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively.
- `num` is `num + 2*k - 2`.
- `t` is `False`.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` equals 1.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1.

Output: **1**
