Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 3 to `m + 1`. This means the loop will start when `i` is 3 and continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: From the given state, `i` is currently 0.

4. **Determine the value of `m`**: The value of `m` is given as `m = n - (num + 2*k - 2)`. Since `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, it must be some positive integer greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be 3 (the starting point of the loop). Also, `m` must be at least 3 because if `m` were less than 3, the loop would not start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be at least 3**
