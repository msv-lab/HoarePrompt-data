Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be at least 3, `dp[3]` is (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % 1000000007**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `dp[3]` is calculated as `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % 1000000007`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the updated value of `dp[3]` is included in the output state.
