Output State: **`m` is an integer equal to `n` - `num`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split during the final iteration, `r` is the second integer from the input split during the final iteration, `num` is 3, `t` is `False`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` and `r` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively, `i` is less than `k`, `num` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is increased by 2, making it 3 (since `num` was initially either 1 or 2). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
