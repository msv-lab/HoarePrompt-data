Output State: **`i` is the next element in `a`; `x` is a list where the last element is `x[-1] ^ i`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `x` the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (`x[-1]`) and the variable `i`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `x` and the unchanged variable `i`.
