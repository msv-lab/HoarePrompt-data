Output State: **`inds[x[-1]]` now includes the value `len(x) - 1 + 1`, `i` is the next element in `a`, `x` is a list where the last element is `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`, and `x` has an additional element which is `x[-1] ^ i`.**

Explanation: 
- The code appends `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Since `x[-1]` is `x[-1] ^ i`, the new last element of `x` is `x[-1] ^ i ^ i`, which simplifies to `x[-1]` because `a ^ a = 0` for any value `a`.
- The value of `inds[x[-1]]` is updated to include `len(x) - 1 + 1` because the length of `x` increases by 1 after appending the new element.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is described as "the next element in `a`" and no operation is performed on it within the given code snippet.
