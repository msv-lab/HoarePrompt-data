Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `q` is stated to be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed since it does not affect the print statement.
- `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, but the exact function `func_1` and the argument `int` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
- `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, similar to `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.
- `upper` is derived from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`, but without knowing the exact values of `inds`, `x`, and the function `func_3`, we cannot determine the exact value of `upper`.

However, the print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Output: **No**
