Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < q`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `q` must be greater than 0
   - `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`
   - `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the condition holds as is. If `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, the condition also holds accordingly.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and `q` must be greater than 0, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `q`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged, but it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be 1 (since it is incremented by 1 from 0).
   - `q` must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `l`, `r`, and `upper` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`**
