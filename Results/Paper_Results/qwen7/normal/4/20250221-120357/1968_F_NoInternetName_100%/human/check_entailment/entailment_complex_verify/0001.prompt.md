You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a callable object (e.g., int, float), and the input is a space-separated string of integers or other values that can be cast to the specified type.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the casted integers from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable object `cast` and a space-separated string of integers or other values. It processes the string by splitting it into individual elements, casting each element to the type specified by `cast`, and returns a map object containing these casted integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean.
def func_2(arr, predicate):

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `l` will be the index of the smallest element that satisfies the predicate, and `r` will be the index just beyond the last element that satisfies the predicate, or it could be the point where further division is not possible due to the condition `l + 1 >= r`.

    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function. It uses binary search to find the last index where the predicate function returns `True`. If such an index exists, it returns that index; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#Function 3:

def func_3(arr, predicate):

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It checks each element in the list `arr` using the predicate function. If the predicate function returns True for any element in the list, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.

        #The program returns the value of `result` plus 1, where `result` is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)` and is not None.
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean, `result` is `None`
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It calls another function `func_2(arr, predicate)` and returns the value of `result` plus one if `result` is not `None`. If `func_2(arr, predicate)` returns `None`, the function simply returns `None`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( q \), a list of integers \( a \), and processes \( q \) queries. For each query, it checks if there exists an index \( k \) in the range \( l \leq k < r \) such that the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index \( k \) is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start of the list up to index \( r \). If such an index exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. The solution uses prefix XOR to simplify this check.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - A prefix XOR array `x` is constructed where `x[i] = a[0] ^ a[1] ^ ... ^ a[i-1]`.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the subarray `a[l:r]` has a bitwise XOR of 0, which can be split into parts with the same XOR value trivially.
   - Otherwise, we need to find indices where the prefix XOR matches the required value to split the subarray.

3. **Binary Search Functions (`func_2` and `func_4`)**:
   - These functions perform binary search to find the first index where the condition holds.
   - However, these functions are not used in the main logic of `func_5`. Instead, `func_3` and `func_5` use direct list operations, which is more straightforward and efficient for this problem.

4. **Main Logic (`func_5`)**:
   - The function reads the input values `n` and `q`.
   - It constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and stores indices in a dictionary `inds`.
   - For each query `(l, r)`, it checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` directly.
   - If not, it finds the lower and upper bounds using the stored indices and checks if they can form valid splits.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the construction of the prefix XOR array and the storage of indices.
   - The logic for checking the subarray's interesting property is implemented correctly.
   - The binary search functions are not necessary and could be simplified.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the implementation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
