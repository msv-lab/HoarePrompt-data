Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`**

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` assigns the results of the function call `func_1(int)` to the variables `l` and `r`. The initial values of `i` and `q` remain unchanged. The function `func_1(int)` is called twice, once for `l` and once for `r`, but since the function's implementation is not specified, we only know that `l` and `r` are the results of calling `func_1(int)`. The condition that `q` must be greater than 0 remains unaffected.
