Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n for each query, `x` is a list containing the single element 0; `inds[0]` is now a list containing the element 0.**

In this output state, the defaultdict `inds` has been updated such that the key `0` now points to a list containing the element `0`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
