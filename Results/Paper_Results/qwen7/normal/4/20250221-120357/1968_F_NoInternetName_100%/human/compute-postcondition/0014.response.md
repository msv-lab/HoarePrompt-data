Output State: **`x` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds[x[-1]]` is a list containing all indices of elements in `x`.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `x` will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in the list `a`. Specifically, the last element of `x` will be the result of XORing all elements in `a` together. The dictionary `inds` will map this final value of `x[-1]` to a list of all indices where this value appears in `x`, which will include every index from 0 to the length of `x` - 1, as each value in `x` is unique due to the properties of the XOR operation.
