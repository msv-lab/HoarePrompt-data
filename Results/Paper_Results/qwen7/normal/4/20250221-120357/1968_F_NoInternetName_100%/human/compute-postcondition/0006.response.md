Output State: **`x` is a list where the last element is updated to the value of the last element of `x` XORed with `i`.**

Explanation: The code `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends to the list `x` the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (denoted as `x[-1]`) and the value of `i`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `x` or `i`, but it specifies that `x` is a list. After executing the code, the last element of `x` is updated to the result of this operation.
