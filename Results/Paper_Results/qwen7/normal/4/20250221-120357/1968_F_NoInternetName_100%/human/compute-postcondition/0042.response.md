Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `q` in the statement `for i in range(q):`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < q`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `q` must be greater than 0
   - `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`
   - `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`
   - `upper` is the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2.
   - The value of `q` must remain the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration because the loop condition depends on `i < q` and `q` does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` should be updated to 2.
   - `q` remains the same (greater than 0).
   - `l`, `r`, and `upper` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]**
