Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. The overall postcondition remains unchanged as both the if and else parts do not alter the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `upper`.**
