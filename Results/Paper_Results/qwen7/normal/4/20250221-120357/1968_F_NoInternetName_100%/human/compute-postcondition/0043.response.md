Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)], l is the result of `func_1(int)`, r is the result of `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` updates the values of `l` and `r` to be the results of calling `func_1(int)`. The values of `i`, `q`, and `upper` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `q` is still greater than 0, and `upper` is still defined as the value from `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. The new values of `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`.
