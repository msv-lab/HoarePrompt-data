Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `q` must be greater than 0 (though its specific value is not needed for the print statement).
- `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`. Since no specific function or return value for `func_1` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `l`.
- `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`. Similarly, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`.
- `upper` is the result of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. Here, `inds` is an assumed dictionary or list of lists, and `x` is a list. Given `l` is derived from `func_1(int)`, `x[l - 1]` would be the element at index `l - 1` in the list `x`. `func_3` is applied with a lambda function that checks if the argument is less than or equal to `r`, and then the result is used to index into `inds[x[l - 1]]`.

However, the print statement simply outputs the string "Yes". Therefore, the output does not depend on any of the other variables or their values.

Output: **Yes**
