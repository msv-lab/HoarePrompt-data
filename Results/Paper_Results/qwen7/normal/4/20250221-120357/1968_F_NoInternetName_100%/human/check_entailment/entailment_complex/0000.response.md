### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a space-separated string of integers from standard input and casts them to the specified type (in this case, `int`). It then returns a map object containing these integers.
   - The function correctly parses and casts the input integers, but the use of `map` directly without converting to a list might cause issues later when trying to access specific elements. However, since the subsequent functions handle the data appropriately, this is not a critical issue.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the last index where the predicate function returns `True`.
   - The function correctly implements the binary search logic and returns the appropriate index or `None` if no such index exists.
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly, ensuring that the binary search works as expected.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function simply calls `func_2` and returns the result.
   - Since `func_2` works correctly, `func_3` also works correctly by forwarding the result.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function adds 1 to the result of `func_2` if the result is not `None`, otherwise it returns `None`.
   - The function correctly handles the addition and returns the appropriate value.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function processes the main logic of the problem.
   - It constructs a list `x` where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` up to that point.
   - It uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each cumulative XOR value.
   - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR from the start up to index `l-1` is equal to the cumulative XOR from the start up to index `r`. If they are equal, the subarray is interesting, and it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it finds the lower and upper bounds within the range `[l, r]` where the cumulative XOR matches the required value and prints 'Yes' if the upper bound is greater than the lower bound, otherwise 'No'.
   - The function correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting.

### Conclusion:
Given that all functions work correctly and the overall logic of `func_5` is sound, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
