Output State: **`x` is a list where the last element is updated to the value of the last element of `x` XORed with `i`; `inds[x[-1]]` now contains the length of `x` - 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the index of the last element of the list `x` (which is `len(x) - 1`) to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Since the last element of `x` was previously updated to the value of the last element of `x` XORed with `i`, the value of `x[-1]` remains unchanged from its previous state, and `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the current length of `x` minus one.
