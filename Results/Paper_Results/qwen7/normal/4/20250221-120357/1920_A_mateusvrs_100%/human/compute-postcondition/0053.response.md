Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `cx` (i.e., `cx` is non-empty).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **`cx`**: Since `cx` must have at least one unique `x` value, for the loop to continue, `cx` must still have at least one element. After the previous iteration, `cx` had at least one element, and `i` was the next element in `cx`.
   - **`i`**: `i` is the next element in `cx` after the previous iteration.
   - **`tmp`**: The value of `tmp` depends on whether `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`. If `i` is within this range, `tmp` is increased by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. Since we are starting a new iteration, we cannot assume the value of `tmp` without knowing the value of `i`. However, we know that `tmp` will be adjusted based on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cx` still has at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` will be adjusted based on the new value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cx` must have at least one unique `x` value, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` will be increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
