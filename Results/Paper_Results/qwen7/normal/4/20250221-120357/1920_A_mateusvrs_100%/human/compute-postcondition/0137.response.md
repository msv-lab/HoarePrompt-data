Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` remains the minimum of `x` and 1000000000. Otherwise, `cx` includes `x`.
