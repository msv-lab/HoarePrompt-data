Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `r` is a list containing either [0] or [1000000000 - bx + 1 - tmp], `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is equal to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` equals 1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 2. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `a` is not equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and the previous value of `ax`. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `cx` contains the elements `{x}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either the minimum of the first and second integers from the input or an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, and `cx` is a set containing `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
