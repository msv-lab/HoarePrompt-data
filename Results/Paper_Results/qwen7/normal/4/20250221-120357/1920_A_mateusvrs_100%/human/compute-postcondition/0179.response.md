Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a series of constraints involving integers `a` and `x`. For each constraint, it updates variables `ax` and `bx` based on the value of `a`. After processing all constraints for each test case, it calculates a result stored in a list `r` based on the values of `ax`, `bx`, and a set `cx`. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.**
