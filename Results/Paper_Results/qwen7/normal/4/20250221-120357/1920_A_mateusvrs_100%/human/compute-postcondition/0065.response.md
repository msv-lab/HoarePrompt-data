Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `_` (which is used as the loop variable) and `n` (the range parameter).

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `_` is a loop variable that will take values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` will take values from 0 to `n-1`, we don't need to adjust its initial state because it will be initialized within the loop itself.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables in the state**:
   - `t`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
