Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000**.

The code initializes `ax` with the value of `int(1000000000.0 + 7)`, which evaluates to `1000000000`. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
