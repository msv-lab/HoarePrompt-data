Postcondition: **`n` will be 0, `a` will be the minimum value between the first two inputs if `n` was originally greater than 1, otherwise it could be any integer from the inputs, `x` will hold the last input value, `bx` will store the highest `x` value encountered, and `cx` will contain all distinct `x` values processed throughout the loop. The condition `bx <= ax` holds true.**
