Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `n` and the loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a placeholder when the loop variable itself is not needed).

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n > 0`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop will decrement `n` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `n` will be `n - 1`.
   - The other variables (`x`, `bx`, `ax`, `cx`, and `a`) are not directly modified by the loop head and thus their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, which must be decremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
