Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. The values of `n`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `t`, and `ax` remain unchanged from their initial states.
