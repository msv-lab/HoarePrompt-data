Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be 0, `a` will be the minimum value between the first two inputs if `n` was originally greater than 1, otherwise it could be any integer from the inputs, `x` will be the last integer input during the loop's execution, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed (including the initial value), and `cx` will be a set containing all unique `x` values that were processed, excluding any duplicates. Additionally, if `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` contains the value 0; otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range from `bx` to `ax` (inclusive).**
