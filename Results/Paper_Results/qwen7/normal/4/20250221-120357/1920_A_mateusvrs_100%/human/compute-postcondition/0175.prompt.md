Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is a list containing either [0] or [ax - bx + 1 - tmp], `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, and `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be 0, `a` will be the minimum value between the first two inputs if `n` was originally greater than 1, otherwise it could be any integer from the inputs, `x` will be the last integer input during the loop's execution, `bx` will be the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed (including the initial value), and `cx` will be a set containing all unique `x` values that were processed, excluding any duplicates. Additionally, if `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` contains the value 0; otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range from `bx` to `ax` (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is equal to the total number of iterations executed, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `r` is a list containing either one element which is 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `t` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `a` is the last input integer, and `x` is the last input integer. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` is [0]. Otherwise, `n` is 0, `cx` is an empty set, `i` is undefined, `tmp` is either 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, and `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
