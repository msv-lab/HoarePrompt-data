Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is added to the set `cx`, `cx` contains the elements `{x}`**.

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since sets cannot contain duplicate elements, if `x` was already in `cx`, it would remain unchanged. Given the initial conditions, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, and `x` is an integer from the input. After executing the code, `x` is added to the set `cx`, resulting in `cx` containing the element `{x}`.
