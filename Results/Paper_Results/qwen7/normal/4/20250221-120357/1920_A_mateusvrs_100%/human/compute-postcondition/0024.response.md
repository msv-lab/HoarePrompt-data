Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is `n - 1`, `cx` is a set containing `x` or an empty set, `ax` is `min(x, ax)`, `bx` is -1, `a` is either 2 or not 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Since `x` is an input integer, and `ax` was previously `min(x, 1000000000)`, the new value of `ax` will be `min(x, min(x, 1000000000))`, which simplifies to `min(x, ax)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
