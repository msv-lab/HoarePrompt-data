Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, and `tmp` is 0.**

The code `tmp = 0` initializes the variable `tmp` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states.
