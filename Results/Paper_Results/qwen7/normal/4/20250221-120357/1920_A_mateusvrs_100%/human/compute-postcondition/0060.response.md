Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `r` is a list containing either [0] or [ax - bx + 1 - tmp].
   - `n` is 0.
   - `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop.
   - `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided.
   - `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided.
   - `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `t`, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `_`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `r` is a list containing either [0] or [ax - bx + 1 - tmp], `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, and `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`**.
