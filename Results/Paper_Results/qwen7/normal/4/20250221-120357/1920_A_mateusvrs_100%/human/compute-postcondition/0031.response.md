Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is `n - 2`, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`, or `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the input values for `a` and `x` are not specified, they are left as input integers.
