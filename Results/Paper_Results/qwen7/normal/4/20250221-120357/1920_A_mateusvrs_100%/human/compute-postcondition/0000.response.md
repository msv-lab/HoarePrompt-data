Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive. Each test case contains an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**

This means that the value of `t` has been updated to the integer input from the user, while all other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
