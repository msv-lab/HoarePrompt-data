Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` could be any integer from the inputs, `x` could be any integer from the inputs, `bx` could be any integer from the inputs, `cx` could be a set of integers, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `x`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
