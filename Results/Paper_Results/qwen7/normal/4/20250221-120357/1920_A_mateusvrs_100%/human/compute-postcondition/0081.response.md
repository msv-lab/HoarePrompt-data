Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. Variables `a` and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input.
