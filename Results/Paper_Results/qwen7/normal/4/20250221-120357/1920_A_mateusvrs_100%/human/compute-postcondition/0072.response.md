Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 2, `x` is an input integer, and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ax` to be the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Given that `ax` is initially `a` which is 2, `ax` will be updated to `min(x, 2)`. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged.
