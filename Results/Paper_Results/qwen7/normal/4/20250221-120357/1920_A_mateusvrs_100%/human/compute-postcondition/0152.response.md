Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `bx` is either 1 or -1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions, `t` is 0, `ax` is either 1000000000 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables `n`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `t`, `ax`, `a`, and `x`. The only difference is in the description of `cx`: it is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, which is consistent with both the if and else parts.
