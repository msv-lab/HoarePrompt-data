Output State: **`n` is 0, `cx` is an empty set, `i` is undefined, `tmp` is either 0 or the number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `t` is 0, and `a` is the last input integer, `x` is the last input integer.**

Explanation: The code `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends the value of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Since `r` was initially undefined (or could be considered as an empty list), after executing this line, `r` becomes a list containing the single element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
