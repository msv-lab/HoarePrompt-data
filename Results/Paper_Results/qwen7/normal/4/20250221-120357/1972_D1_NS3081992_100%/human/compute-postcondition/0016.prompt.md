You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and the product of n and m does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and the product of `n` and `m` does not exceed \(2 \times 10^6\); `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` from 2 to `m`.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
    #- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
    #- The loop stops when `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.
    #
    #Given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `m + 1` (since the condition `i <= m` must fail), and considering the increments, `i` will be `m + 1` at the end of the loop.
    #
    #The value of `ans` accumulates the result of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` starting from 2 up to `m`. This is because the loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, stopping just before `i` becomes `m + 1`.
    #
    #Thus, the final state of the loop is characterized by `i` being `m + 1`, and `ans` being the cumulative sum described above.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
