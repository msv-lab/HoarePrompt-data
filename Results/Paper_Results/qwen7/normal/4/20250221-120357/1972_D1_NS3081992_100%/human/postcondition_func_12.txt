This function calculates the coefficients x and y, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integers a and b, such that ax + by = gcd(a, b). If b is 0, it directly returns x = 1, y = 0, and a. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with parameters b and a % b, then uses the results to compute and return the correct x, y, and g.
