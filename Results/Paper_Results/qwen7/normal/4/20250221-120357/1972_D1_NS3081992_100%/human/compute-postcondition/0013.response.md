Output State: `i` is `m + 1`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and the product of `n` and `m` does not exceed \(2 \times 10^6\); `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all `i` from 2 to `m`.

To understand this, let's break it down:

- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop stops when `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.

Given that the loop runs until `i` reaches `m + 1` (since the condition `i <= m` must fail), and considering the increments, `i` will be `m + 1` at the end of the loop.

The value of `ans` accumulates the result of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` starting from 2 up to `m`. This is because the loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, stopping just before `i` becomes `m + 1`.

Thus, the final state of the loop is characterized by `i` being `m + 1`, and `ans` being the cumulative sum described above.
