Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the functions defined in the program do not perform this calculation. Instead, they seem to be utility functions or possibly related to other problems. Specifically, `func_15` appears to be an attempt to solve a different problem, and `func_16` is simply calling `func_15` in a loop without implementing the main logic required by the problem statement.

Since the program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the given problem, it is incorrect.
