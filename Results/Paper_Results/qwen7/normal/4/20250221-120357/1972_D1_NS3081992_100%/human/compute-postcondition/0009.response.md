Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function does not return any value directly but seems to perform some operations based on these inputs.**

However, since the exact operations are not specified in the given information, the focus here is on the parameters and their constraints rather than the specific functionality.
