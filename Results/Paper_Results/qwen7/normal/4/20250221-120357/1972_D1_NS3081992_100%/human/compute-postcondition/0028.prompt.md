You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; processing is a list of length max(da) containing only 0s and 1s; da and rank are integers such that 1 <= da <= max(da) and rank is a list of length max(da) initialized with zeros.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; `processing` is a list of length `max(da)` containing only 0s and 1s; `da` and `rank` are integers such that 1 <= `da` <= `max(da)` and `rank` is a list of length `max(da)` initialized with zeros; `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of `d[da]` is greater than 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
        
    #State: All elements in `processing` are set to 1, `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`, and `da`, `di`, `rank`, and `d` retain their original values from the initial state.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns tmp + 1, where tmp is updated to the minimum value between its original value (1000000000) and the results of func_12(d, processing, di, rank) for each di in d[da]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns either 1 or `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (1000000000) and the results of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns tmp + 1, where tmp is updated to the minimum value between its original value (1000000000) and the results of func_12(d, processing, di, rank) for each di in d[da]


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
