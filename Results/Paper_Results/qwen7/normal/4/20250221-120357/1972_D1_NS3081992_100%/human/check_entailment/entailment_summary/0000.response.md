Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**: We need to analyze the functions to understand their roles in solving the problem.
2. **Main Function**: `func_16` is the main function that processes the test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m` using `func_7`. Then, it calls `func_15` to calculate the result and prints it.
3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_7` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and returns them as a list `[n, m]`.
   - `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for given `n` and `m` according to the problem statement.
4. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
5. **Function `func_15` Implementation**: `func_15` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs for a given `n` and `m`. It iterates through possible values of `i` from 2 to `m` and checks the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The formula used in `func_15` is derived from the problem's constraints and correctly counts the valid pairs.
6. **Overall Program Flow**: The main function `func_16` correctly processes the input and outputs the results as required.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
