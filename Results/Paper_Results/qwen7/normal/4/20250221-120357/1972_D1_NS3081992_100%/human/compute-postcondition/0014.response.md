Output State: **The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(m\), minus 1.**

This means that the program calculates the sum of the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each integer \(i\) starting from 2 up to \(m\), and then subtracts 1 from this sum before returning the result.
