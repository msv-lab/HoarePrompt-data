Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `func_10()` returns an integer within this range, the loop will execute between 1 and 10,000 times. Each iteration of the loop prints a positive integer returned by `func_15()`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will consist of printing a positive integer from `func_15()` for each iteration, up to a maximum of 10,000 such integers.

In natural language: The loop will print a sequence of positive integers, one per line, with the total number of integers printed being equal to the return value of `func_10()`, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
