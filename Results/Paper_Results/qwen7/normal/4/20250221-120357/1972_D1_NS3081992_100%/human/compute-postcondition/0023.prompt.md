Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; `processing` is a list of length `max(da)` containing only 0s and 1s; `da` and `rank` are integers such that 1 <= `da` <= `max(da)` and `rank` is a list of length `max(da)` initialized with zeros; `tmp` is 1000000000. The length of `d[da]` is greater than 1
Code of the loop:
for di in d[da]:
    if processing[di - 1] == 0:
        processing[di - 1] = 1
        tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
        processing[di - 1] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer, `di` is the first element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. If `processing[di - 1]` is not 0, no changes occur to `tmp`, `da`, or `di`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer, `di` is the next element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is equal to 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `processing[di - 1]` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the case where `processing[di - 1]` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer, `di` is the next element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is equal to 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `processing[di - 1]` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in other cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
