Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `da` is an integer, `di` is the next element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1]` is equal to 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `processing[di - 1]` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in other cases.
