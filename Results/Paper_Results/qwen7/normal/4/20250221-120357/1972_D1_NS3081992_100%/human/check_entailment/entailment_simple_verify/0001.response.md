### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided solution is correct. Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem statement and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Statement and Requirements:**
   - Calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
     - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The solution uses the insight that for a given \(i\), the number of valid \(a\) values is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Function `func_15`:**
   - Reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
   - Iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 up to \(m\) (or until \(i^2 > n + i\)).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
   - Returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Function `func_16`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases using `func_10`.
   - Calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code provides detailed states and transitions for each function, confirming the logic flow.
   - `func_15` correctly implements the logic to count valid pairs based on the derived formula.
   - The loop in `func_15` ensures that all possible values of \(i\) are considered up to \(m\).

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
     - \(i = 1\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 1}{1^2} \right\rfloor = 11\)
     - \(i = 2\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 2}{2^2} \right\rfloor = 3\)
     - \(i = 3\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 3}{3^2} \right\rfloor = 1\)
     - \(i = 4\): \(\left\lfloor \frac{10 + 4}{4^2} \right\rfloor = 0\)
     - Total: \(11 + 3 + 1 = 15\)
     - Subtract 1: \(15 - 1 = 14\)

   - This matches the expected output for the given example.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The annotated code confirms the correctness of the implementation.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
