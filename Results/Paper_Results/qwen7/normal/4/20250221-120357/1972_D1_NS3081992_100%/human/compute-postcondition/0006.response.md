Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `func_15()` returns a positive integer and its value is printed, `_` is `k`, and a positive integer from `func_15()` is printed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` prints the return value of the function `func_15()`. Since `func_15()` returns a positive integer, it is printed. The initial state of `t`, `_` being `k`, and the fact that `func_10()` must return a positive integer remain unchanged.
