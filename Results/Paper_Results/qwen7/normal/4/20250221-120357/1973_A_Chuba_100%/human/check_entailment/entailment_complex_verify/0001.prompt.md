You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and there will be no further inputs or computations on `v`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of these integers is odd. If the sum is even, it calculates a specific value based on these integers and prints it; otherwise, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function ends with no further operations on the input data.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game contributes either 2 points to the total score (if there is a clear winner and loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw). Hence, the total score must be even.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` immediately, indicating an inconsistency in the scores.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated while respecting the constraints of the scores.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the scores might not be achievable due to the constraints of the game rules. For instance, in the case where `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, the program correctly identifies that this scenario is impossible and prints `-1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum possible number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. It handles the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
