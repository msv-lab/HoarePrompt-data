### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game contributes either 2 points to the total score (if there is a clear winner and loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw). Hence, the total score must be even.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` immediately, indicating an inconsistency in the scores.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The program uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - However, this formula does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Let's analyze why:
     - The term `p3 - p1 - p2` represents the difference in scores between the highest score and the combined scores of the other two players.
     - If `p3 - p1 - p2` is negative, it means the highest score cannot be achieved solely by wins from the other two players, and thus some draws must be considered.
     - The term `max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)` ensures that we only consider non-negative differences, meaning we only subtract the minimum required wins to make up for the difference in scores.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, but the formula does not account for the fact that the remaining points after accounting for wins and draws must be distributed among the players in a way that respects the constraints of the game.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the scores might not be achievable due to the constraints of the game rules. For instance, in the case where `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, the program correctly identifies that this scenario is impossible and prints `-1`.
   - However, the formula used in the calculation of the maximum number of draws is flawed and does not accurately reflect the maximum possible number of draws.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum possible number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The formula used in the calculation of the maximum number of draws is incorrect and does not accurately reflect the maximum possible number of draws.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
