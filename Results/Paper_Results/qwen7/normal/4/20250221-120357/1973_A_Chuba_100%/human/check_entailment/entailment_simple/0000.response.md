Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` into a list `v`.
3. The function checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. If it is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
4. If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula ensures that the calculated number of draws does not exceed the possible points distribution among the players.
5. The function handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided program logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
