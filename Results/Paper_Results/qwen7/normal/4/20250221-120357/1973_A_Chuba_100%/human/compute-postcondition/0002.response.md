Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `v`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `v` is now a list of integers based on the user's input.
