Postcondition: `t` is greater than -1, `v` is a list of integers converted from input integers. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, the postcondition does not specify any change to `t` or `v`. Otherwise, `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
