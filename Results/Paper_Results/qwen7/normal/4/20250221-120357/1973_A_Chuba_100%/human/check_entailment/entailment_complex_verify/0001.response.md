### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers representing the scores of the three players: `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game contributes either 2 points to the total score (if there is a clear winner and loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw). Hence, the total score must be even.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` immediately, indicating an inconsistency in the scores.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p1 + p2 + p3 - \max(0, p3 - p1 - p2))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated while respecting the constraints of the scores. However, there is a flaw in this formula. Let's analyze it with some examples:

     - **Example 1**: `p1 = 0`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 1`
       - Sum: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
       - Calculation: \(\frac{(0 + 1 + 1 - \max(0, 1 - 0 - 1))}{2} = \frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1\)
       - Correct result: 1 (since one draw between p2 and p3)

     - **Example 2**: `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 2`
       - Sum: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
       - Calculation: \(\frac{(1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1))}{2} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2\)
       - Correct result: 2 (since two draws: one between p1 and p2, and another between p2 and p3)

     - **Example 3**: `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, `p3 = 10`
       - Sum: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
       - Calculation: \(\frac{(1 + 1 + 10 - \max(0, 10 - 1 - 1))}{2} = \frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2\)
       - Correct result: -1 (since it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given constraints)

   - The formula used in the program is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the minimum number of wins required and then calculate the remaining points as draws. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(p3 - p1) + (p3 - p2)}{2}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the scores might not be achievable due to the constraints of the game rules. For instance, in the case where `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, the program correctly identifies that this scenario is impossible and prints `-1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum possible number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has a logical error in its calculation of the maximum number of draws. The formula used is incorrect, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
