Output State: **`counter` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1', and `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Given the initial state where `counter` is 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s1[i + 1]` (if `i` is less than `n - 1`), otherwise `counter` is 0, the value of `counter` is incremented from 1 to 2. All other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
