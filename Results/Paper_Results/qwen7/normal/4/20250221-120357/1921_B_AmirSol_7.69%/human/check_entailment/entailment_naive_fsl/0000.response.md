Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios.

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 4
s1 = "0101"
s2 = "1010"
```

Expected output: `2` (Move the cat from the 1st box to the 2nd box, and then from the 3rd box to the 4th box).

However, the program will output `1` because it incorrectly assumes that moving a cat from one box to another and then moving another cat from one box to another can be done in a single operation under certain conditions. This is not always true and does not cover all possible scenarios.

For example, in the above test case, the program would incorrectly assume that moving the cat from the 1st box to the 2nd box and then moving the cat from the 3rd box to the 4th box can be done in one operation, which is not valid according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
