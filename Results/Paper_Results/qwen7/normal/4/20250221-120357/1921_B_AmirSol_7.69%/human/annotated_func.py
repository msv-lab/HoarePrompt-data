#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where '1' indicates the presence of a cat in the corresponding box in the initial and final states, respectively.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1

    #State: Output State: The final value of `counter` will be the sum of all increments made during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be set to `n` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over all elements of the strings `s1` and `s2`.
    #
    #In more detail, `counter` will be incremented each time there is a mismatch between `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` under specific conditions. These conditions are:
    #- `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`
    #- If `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`
    #
    #If these conditions are met, `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` skips two positions (`i += 2`). Otherwise, `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` moves to the next position (`i += 1`).
    #
    #After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `counter` will hold the total number of valid mismatches found in the strings `s1` and `s2` according to the given conditions.
    return counter
    #The program returns the total number of valid mismatches found in the strings `s1` and `s2` according to the given conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It counts and returns the total number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, following specific conditions. If `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are different, and either `i` is not the last index or the characters at `i+1` in both strings are also different and not equal to `s1[i]`, then it counts this as a valid mismatch. Otherwise, it counts it as a mismatch without the additional condition. After checking all positions, it returns the total count of valid mismatches.
