Postcondition: `counter` is an integer, `i` is 4, and `n` is a positive integer. `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. If `s1[i] != s2[i]`, then:
- If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, `counter` is increased by 1 and `i` is set to 5.
- Otherwise, `counter` is incremented by 2 and `i` is set to 4.
If `s1[i] == s2[i]`, then `i` is 4.
