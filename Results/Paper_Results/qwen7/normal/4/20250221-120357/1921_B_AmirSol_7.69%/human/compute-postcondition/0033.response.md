Postcondition: `counter` is increased based on the conditions: if `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, then `counter` is increased by 1; otherwise, `counter` is incremented by 2. `i` is set to 4, and `n` is a positive integer, while `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.
