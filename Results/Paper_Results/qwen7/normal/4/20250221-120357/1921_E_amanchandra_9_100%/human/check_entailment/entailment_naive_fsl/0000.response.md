Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Test Case**: `6 5 2 2 5 3`
   - Alice starts at (2, 2), Bob at (5, 3).
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   - Alice can move to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3).
   - Bob can move to (4, 3), (4, 2), or (4, 4).
   - If Alice moves to (3, 2), Bob can move to (4, 3), and so on.
   - The program incorrectly determines the result based on the relative positions without considering the optimal moves.

2. **Test Case**: `4 1 2 1 4 1`
   - Alice starts at (2, 1), Bob at (4, 1).
   - Alice can only move down, but Bob can move up.
   - Since Bob can move up to (3, 1) and then to (2, 1), Bob can force a win.
   - The program incorrectly outputs "Draw".

3. **Test Case**: `1 4 1 3 1 1`
   - Alice starts at (1, 3), Bob at (1, 1).
   - Alice cannot move down, and Bob cannot move up.
   - The game ends in a draw.
   - The program incorrectly outputs "Alice".

These examples show that the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game for all cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
