Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is one less than its previous value. Since no previous value is given, let's assume `t` was initialized to some value, but it doesn't affect the current print statement directly.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. This means `r = min(w, d + x)`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input. Let's denote these values as follows:
     - `w = w_value`
     - `a = a_value`
     - `b = b_value`
     - `c = c_value`
     - `d = d_value`
     - `x = x_value`
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`. So, `l = max(1, d - x)`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
   ```
   - The expression inside the square brackets `['Draw'], ['Alice']` is evaluated based on the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - If both conditions are true, the expression evaluates to `['Alice']`. Otherwise, it evaluates to `['Draw']`.

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

Given the conditions:
- If both conditions are true, the output will be `['Alice']`.
- If either condition is false, the output will be `['Draw']`.

Since the exact values of `w`, `d`, `x`, and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact outcome. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'`.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] (depending on the values of l, r, b, and x)**
