Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even).
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` retain their original values.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `_` is used, which means it doesn't capture the value of `t` directly. Instead, the loop runs `t` times.
- The loop does not change the values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` within the loop body (since these are not mentioned as being modified in the problem description).
- The only state that changes is `t`, which is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop runs `t` times and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, after one iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1.
- Therefore, `t` must now be greater than 0 but one less than its previous value.

### New State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 but one less than its previous value.
- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` retain their original values.
- `l` retains its value from the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 but one less than its previous value, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even), `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` retain their original values, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even)**.
