Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user.**

Explanation: The code splits the input (which is expected to be a series of space-separated integers) into six variables: `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the new variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the respective integers from the input.
