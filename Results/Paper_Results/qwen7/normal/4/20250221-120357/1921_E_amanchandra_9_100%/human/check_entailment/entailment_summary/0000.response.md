Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case individually.
   - It checks if Alice's initial row position (`x_a`) is greater than Bob's (`x_b`). If so, it immediately prints 'Draw', which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - If `x_a` is not greater than `x_b`, it proceeds to calculate the midpoint between `x_a` and `x_b`. This midpoint calculation is correct.
   - The program then checks if Alice or Bob can win based on their respective positions relative to this midpoint. The logic here is also correct:
     - For Alice to win, her column position (`y_a`) must be within a certain range defined by the midpoint and the calculated distance.
     - For Bob to win, his column position (`y_b`) must be within a similar range.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the positions might be at the boundaries of the grid (i.e., `l` or `r` should not go out of bounds).
   - The logic for determining the win condition is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
