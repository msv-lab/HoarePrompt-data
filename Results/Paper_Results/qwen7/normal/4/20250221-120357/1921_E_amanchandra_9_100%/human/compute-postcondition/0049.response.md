Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` or `b - x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, and `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a > c` is true or false, the variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input, and the values of `l` and `x` are determined based on specific conditions related to the absolute difference between `a` and `c`.
