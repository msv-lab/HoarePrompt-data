Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t > 0`: This condition is true but does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `r = min(w, d + x)`: The value of `r` depends on the values of `w`, `d`, and `x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input.
   - `l = max(1, d - x)`: The value of `l` depends on the values of `d` and `x`.
   - `x = abs(a - c) // 2`: The value of `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, rounded down to the nearest integer.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the condition inside the square brackets:

- `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`

We need to know the values of `l`, `b`, `r`, and `x` to evaluate this condition.

Given:
- `l = max(1, d - x)`
- `x = abs(a - c) // 2`
- `r = min(w, d + x)`

Let's assume some example values for `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` to illustrate the evaluation:

Assume:
- `a = 5`
- `b = 7`
- `c = 3`
- `d = 6`
- `x = abs(5 - 3) // 2 = 1`

Then:
- `l = max(1, 6 - 1) = 5`
- `r = min(w, 6 + 1) = min(w, 7)`

For simplicity, let's assume `w = 8`:
- `r = min(8, 7) = 7`

Now, evaluate the condition:
- `abs(l - b) = abs(5 - 7) = 2`
- `abs(r - b) = abs(7 - 7) = 0`

So, `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` becomes:
- `2 <= 1 + 1 and 0 <= 1 + 1` which simplifies to `2 <= 2 and 0 <= 2` which is `True`.

Therefore, the expression inside the square brackets evaluates to `['Draw']`, and the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

Output: **['Draw']**
