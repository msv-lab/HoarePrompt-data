Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it compares the positions \((x_a, y_a)\) and \((x_b, y_b)\) on a grid. If \(x_a\) is greater than \(x_b\), it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the midpoint between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) and determines if either Alice or Bob wins based on their respective positions \(y_a\) and \(y_b\). The function outputs 'Alice' or 'Bob' if one of them wins, or 'Draw' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no parameters returned, only printing the results for each test case.**
