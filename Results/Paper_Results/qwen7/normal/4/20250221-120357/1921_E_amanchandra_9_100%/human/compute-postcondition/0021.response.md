Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b + x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even), `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` retain their original values, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd) or `b - x` (if the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even).
