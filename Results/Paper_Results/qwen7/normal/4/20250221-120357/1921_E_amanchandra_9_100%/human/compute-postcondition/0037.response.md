Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` or `b - x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even, and `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code `r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads six integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `r`, and the expressions involving `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` remain valid but are no longer directly specified. The value of `x` is now the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, which was previously defined but is now updated based on the new values of `a` and `c`.
