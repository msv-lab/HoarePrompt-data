Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t > 0`: This means `t` is a positive number.
   - `r = min(w, d + x)`: `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d + x`.
   - `l = max(1, d - x)`: `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d - x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` retain their original values.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
   ```

3. **Evaluating the Condition:**
   - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

   The condition inside the square brackets `[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1]` will evaluate to either `True` or `False`.

4. **Interpreting the Output:**
   - If the condition is `True`, the expression inside the square brackets evaluates to `['Draw']`.
   - If the condition is `False`, the expression inside the square brackets evaluates to `['Alice']`.

5. **Using `*` to Unpack the List:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list, so if the condition is `True`, it will print `['Draw']` as a single item.
   - If the condition is `False`, it will print `['Alice']` as a single item.

Given the initial state and the conditions, we need to determine the value of the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `b`, `r`, and `x` are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether the condition is true or false. However, based on the structure of the problem, the output will be one of the two lists `['Draw']` or `['Alice']`.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice']**
