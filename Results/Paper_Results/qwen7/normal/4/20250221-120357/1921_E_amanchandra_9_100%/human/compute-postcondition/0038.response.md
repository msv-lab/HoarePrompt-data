Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` or `b + x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even.
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `x` are updated to integer values from user input.
- `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` or `b - x` depending on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd or even.
- `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.

The `print('Draw')` statement will print the string "Draw".

Output: **Draw**
