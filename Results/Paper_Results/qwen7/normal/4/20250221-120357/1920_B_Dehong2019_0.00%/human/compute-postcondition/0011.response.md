Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `x` in `a` minus four times the element at index `i` in `a`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Initially, `ans1` was defined as the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `x` in `a` minus twice the element at index `i + 1` in `a`. After executing the code, the term `twice the element at index i + 1 in a` is replaced with `four times the element at index i in a`. Therefore, `ans1` now is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `x` in `a` minus four times the element at index `i` in `a`.
