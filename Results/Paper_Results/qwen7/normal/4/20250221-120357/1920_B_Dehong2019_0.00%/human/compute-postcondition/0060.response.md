Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[i]` if `0 + x` is less than `n`. If `0 + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` remains increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `ans1` was increased by `a[0]` and then adjusted based on the condition involving `x` and `n`. Now, `i` is incremented to 2, so `ans1` is further increased by `a[2]` if `2 + x` is less than `n`. If `2 + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` remains increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
