Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is `ans1` - `a[3]` * 2, `ans` is max(`ans1`, `ans2`)**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + x` becomes `2 + x`. Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - a[2 + x] * 2`. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.
