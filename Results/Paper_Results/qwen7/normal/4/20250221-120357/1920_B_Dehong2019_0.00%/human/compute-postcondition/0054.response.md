Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. The value of `k` remains greater than 0, `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]`, and the condition `i + x` being less than `n` remains true.
