Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `_`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `_`**: In Python, when using `for _ in range(t):`, the variable `_` is simply used as a placeholder and does not hold any specific value. It is incremented automatically by the `range` function.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
