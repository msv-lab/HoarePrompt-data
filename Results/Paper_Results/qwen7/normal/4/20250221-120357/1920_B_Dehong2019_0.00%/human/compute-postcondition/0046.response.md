Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus eight times the `i`-th element of `a`, `ans` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `x`, `k` is `x`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the `i`-th element of `a` from `ans1`. Since `i` is equal to `x`, and `x` is a positive integer, `ans1` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `a` minus eight times the `i`-th element of `a` (as `ans1` was initially the sum minus four times the `i`-th element). All other variables remain unchanged.
