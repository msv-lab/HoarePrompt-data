Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` plus `x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. The initial conditions for `k` and the comparison involving `i` and `x` remain unchanged. The updated value of `ans1` is now `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x]`.
