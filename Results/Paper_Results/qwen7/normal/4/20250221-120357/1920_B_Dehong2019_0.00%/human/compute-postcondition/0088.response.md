Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 4 + x, `x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1**.

In this output state, the variable `ans2` is updated to be equal to `ans1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
