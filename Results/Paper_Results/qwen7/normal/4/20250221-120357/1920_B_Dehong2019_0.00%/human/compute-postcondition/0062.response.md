Postcondition: `k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 2, and `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then:
- If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`.
- If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` remains as it is after being increased by `a[0]` and then `a[i]`.
