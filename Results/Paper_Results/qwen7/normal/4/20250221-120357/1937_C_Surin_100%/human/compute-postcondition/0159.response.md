Output State: **`i` is 5, `prev` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of `i`, `prev`, `n`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 4 remain unchanged.
