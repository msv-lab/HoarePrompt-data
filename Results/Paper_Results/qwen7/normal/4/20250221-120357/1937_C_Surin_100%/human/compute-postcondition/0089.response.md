Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `g` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `v2`, `v1`, `prev`, and `kp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
