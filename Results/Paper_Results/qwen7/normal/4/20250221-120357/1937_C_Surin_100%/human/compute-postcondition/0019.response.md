Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2, `r` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 2) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is now 2, while `i`, `n`, `v2`, and `r` retain their original values.
