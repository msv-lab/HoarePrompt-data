Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is at least 6 but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an input string and it is explicitly given as '='.
- `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value precisely.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

We know:
- `{i}` will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is 1.
- `{prev}` will be replaced by the value of `prev`, but since `prev` is undefined, we cannot provide a precise value for it.

Therefore, the output will include the known values and placeholders for the undefined value.

Output: **'? 1 1 prev prev'**
