Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `prev` is 4 (though `prev` is not part of the loop head, it doesn't affect the loop execution)
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `r2` is an input string

4. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will be 5.
   - `n` must remain greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `prev` remains 4 (not part of the loop head)
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `r2` remains an input string (not part of the loop head)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `prev` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and `r2` is an input string**.
