Output State: **i is n, n must be at least 6, v2 is n-1, v1 is n-1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will take the final value of the loop's range, which is `n-1`. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the last value assigned to `i` is `n-1`. The variable `v2` takes the value of `i` at each iteration, so `v2` will also be `n-1` by the end of the loop. The variable `v1` is updated to the value of `v2` (which is `i`) every time the condition `r == '<'` is met, but since we don't know the exact sequence of inputs, we assume `v1` retains the latest value of `v2` which is `n-1`. All other variables (`prev`, `kp`, `g`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
