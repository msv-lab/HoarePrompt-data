Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be at least 6; `v2` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `v2`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 6 also remains valid.
