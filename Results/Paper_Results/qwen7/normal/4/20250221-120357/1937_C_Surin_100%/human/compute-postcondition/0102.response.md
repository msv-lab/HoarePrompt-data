Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `r` is either the string '<' or no string (since the if part did not execute)
- `v2` is 2
- `v1` is 1
- `prev` is 1
- `kp` is 0
- `g` is 0

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`. Since `v1` is 1 and `v2` is 2, the output will be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
