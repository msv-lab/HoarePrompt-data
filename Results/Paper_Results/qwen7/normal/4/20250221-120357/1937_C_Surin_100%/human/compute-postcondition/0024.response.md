Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 3**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `v2`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `v2` with the value of 3, while `i` and the condition on `n` remain as they were initially.
