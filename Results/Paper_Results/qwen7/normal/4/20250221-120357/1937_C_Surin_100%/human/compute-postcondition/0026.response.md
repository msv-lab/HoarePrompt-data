Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending print statements are written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `v2`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
