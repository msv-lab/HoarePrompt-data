Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is clearly 3. However, `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. Since these variables are not provided, we need to acknowledge this in our output.

Output: **'? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev]'**
