Output State: **`i` must be within the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string with the current value '=', `r2` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. The string `r` is specifically mentioned to be equal to '=', so the output state reflects this specific value.
