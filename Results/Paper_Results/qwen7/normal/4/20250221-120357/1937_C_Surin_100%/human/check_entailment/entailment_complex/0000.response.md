### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of indices.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a lambda function `I` to read space-separated integers from input.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates from 1 to \(n-1\):
     - It compares \((p_{v1} \mid p_{v1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
     - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), it updates `v1` to \(i\).
   - After finding the largest OR value starting from index 0, it further narrows down the indices by comparing \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid prev)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid prev)\), it updates `prev` to \(i\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) = (p_{v1} \mid prev)\), it performs another comparison to ensure correctness.
   - Finally, it outputs the pair \((prev, v1)\) as the answer.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for finding the maximum OR value is correct.
   - The subsequent narrowing down process ensures that the final pair \((prev, v1)\) has the maximum XOR value.
   - The number of queries used is within the limit of \(3n\).

### Conclusion:

The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem and adheres to the constraints. Therefore, the given program is correct.
