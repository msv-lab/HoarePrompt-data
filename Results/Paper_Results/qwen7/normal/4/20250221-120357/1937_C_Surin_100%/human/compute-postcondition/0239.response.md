Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `r2` remains unchanged if `r2` equals '<'. Since no other information about `r2` is provided, we assume it is '<' (or whatever value it had before, but it doesn't affect the final output).
   - `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '='. Again, since no information about `r` is provided, we assume it is '=', so `prev` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```
   - The placeholders `{v1}` and `{prev}` need to be replaced with their actual values.
   - There is no explicit value given for `v1` in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the provided information. Therefore, we will leave it as `v1`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev` as follows:

Output: **? v1 3 v1 2**
