Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is the input from the user after the last iteration, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0.**

In this final state, the loop has executed `n-1` times because the loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-1`. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes. The value of `v2` will be `n-1` as it gets updated to `i` in each iteration. Since the condition `r == '<'` does not change the value of `v1` unless `r` is '<', and since the problem statement does not specify any inputs for `r` other than the ones given for the first three iterations, we assume `r` remains as the user's input from the last iteration. All other variables (`prev`, `kp`, `g`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
