Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 6, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state. Since their values are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the output will include placeholders for these undefined variables.

Output: **'? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev]'**
