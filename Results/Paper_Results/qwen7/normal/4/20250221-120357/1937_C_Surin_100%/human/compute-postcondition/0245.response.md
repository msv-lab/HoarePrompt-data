Output State: **`i` is 3, `r2` is an input string, `prev` is 2 if `r` equals '=', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `r2 = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The initial values of `i` and `prev` remain unchanged. The value of `prev` is dependent on the value of `r`, which is an input string and not defined before this line of code. Therefore, `prev` will be 2 if `r` equals '=', otherwise, it remains unchanged.
