Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement)
- `v2` is 2
- `v1` is 1

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string where:
- `{v1}` is replaced with the value of `v1`, which is 1
- `{v2}` is replaced with the value of `v2`, which is 2

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
