Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 6, `v2` is 1, `v1` is 1, and the current value of `r` is equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is 1) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is now 1, while `v2` remains 1. The conditions and values of `i`, `n`, and `r` stay the same as in the initial state.
