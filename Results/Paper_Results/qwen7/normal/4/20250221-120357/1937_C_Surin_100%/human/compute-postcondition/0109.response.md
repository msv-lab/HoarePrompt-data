Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `r` is the input string from the user
   - `v2` is 2
   - `v1` is 2
   - `prev` is 1
   - `kp` is 0
   - `g` is 0
   - If `r` equals '<', then `v1` remains 2.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2 (because `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1).

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state after adjusting**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - The other variables (`r`, `v2`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is the input string from the user, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**
