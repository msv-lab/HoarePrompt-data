Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is the input string from the user, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1, `prev` is 1, `kp` is 0, `g` is 0**.

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
