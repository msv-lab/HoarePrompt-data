Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is an input integer greater than 5, `prev` is either 5 or 6, `kp` is 6, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which must be greater than 6) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `prev`, and `kp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
