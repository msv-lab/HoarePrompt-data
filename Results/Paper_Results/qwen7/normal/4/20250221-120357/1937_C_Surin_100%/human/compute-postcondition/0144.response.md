Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `r` is an input string**

Explanation: The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not modify any variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
