Output State: **`i` is `prev + 1`, `n` is at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is now equal to `i`, `r2` is the new input string**.

Explanation: The line `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to be equal to the current value of `i`. The other variables (`n`, `r`, and `r2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `prev + 1`, `n` is still at least 2, `r` remains an input string, `prev` is now equal to `i`, and `r2` remains the new input string.
