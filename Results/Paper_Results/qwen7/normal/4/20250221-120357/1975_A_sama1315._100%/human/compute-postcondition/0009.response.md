Output State: **`idx` is 7, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements from `data[4]` to `data[4+n-1]` to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` creates a list `a` by mapping the `int` function over the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n`. Given the initial state where `idx` is 4 and `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, the new value of `idx` becomes `idx + n`, which is 7. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The `results` list remains empty as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The newly created list `a` contains integers converted from the slice of `data`.
