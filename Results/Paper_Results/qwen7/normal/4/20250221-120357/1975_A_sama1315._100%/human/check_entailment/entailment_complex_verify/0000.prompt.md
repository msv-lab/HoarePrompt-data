You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to `n`. At this point, either the function has returned 'Yes' at some iteration when the substring of `sorted_a` starting at index `i` with length equal to the length of `sorted_a` was found within `concatenated_a`, or the function has not returned anything because no such substring was found throughout all iterations. In the latter case, the function will implicitly return 'None' (or simply continue without returning anything specific).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, if no match was found, the function will not return anything specific, implying it might return 'None' by default, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the function's logic.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of positive integers and checks if any substring of the concatenated list `a + a` of length equal to the original list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If such a substring is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, resulting in `idx` being 10 + 2*n, where `n` is the last value read from the `data` list as per the last iteration. The variable `t` must be greater than 0, indicating there were enough iterations specified initially. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, with each `a` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list as described.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, separated by newlines
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by `t` groups of data. Each group includes an integer `n` (length of an array `a`), and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calls `func_1(a)` for each array `a` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1(a)` for each test case, separated by newlines.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be split and reordered to match its sorted version, but this is not sufficient. The program needs to check if there exists a valid split point such that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing sequence through the allowed operations.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if we can split the array into two parts and swap them to make the array non-decreasing. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. The function `func_1` simply checks if the array plus itself contains a subarray that matches the sorted version of the original array, which is not a valid approach for this problem.

A correct solution would involve checking if there is a valid split point such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the end of the first part is less than or equal to the start of the second part. This is not implemented in the given functions.
