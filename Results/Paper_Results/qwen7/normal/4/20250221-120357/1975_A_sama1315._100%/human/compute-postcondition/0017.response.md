Output State: **`idx` is 8 + n + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` and the new element `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by `n`. Initially, `idx` was `8 + n`. After executing `idx += n`, `idx` becomes `8 + n + n`, which simplifies to `8 + 2*n`. The values of `t`, `results`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
