Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them any number of times.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if any contiguous subarray of the doubled array (`a + a`) is sorted in non-decreasing order. If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. However, this approach does not correctly solve the problem because it checks for any subarray being sorted, not necessarily the entire array after rearrangement through swaps.
   - **func_2**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Example Test Cases**:
     - For the input `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, `func_1` would incorrectly return 'Yes' because there exists a subarray `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` which is sorted but the array cannot be fully sorted by any number of splits and swaps.
     - For the input `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, `func_1` would correctly return 'Yes' because we can split and swap to get a sorted array.
     - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, `func_1` would correctly return 'Yes' because the array is already sorted.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as it checks for any subarray being sorted rather than ensuring the entire array can be sorted through the allowed operations.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
