Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using spaces.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `data` is the list of strings resulting from the split operation.
