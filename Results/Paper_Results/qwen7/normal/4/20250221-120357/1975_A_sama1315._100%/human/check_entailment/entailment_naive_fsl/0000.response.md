Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be split and reordered to match its sorted version, but this is not sufficient. The program needs to check if there exists a valid split point such that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing sequence through the allowed operations.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if we can split the array into two parts and swap them to make the array non-decreasing. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. The function `func_1` simply checks if the array plus itself contains a subarray that matches the sorted version of the original array, which is not a valid approach for this problem.

A correct solution would involve checking if there is a valid split point such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the end of the first part is less than or equal to the start of the second part. This is not implemented in the given functions.
