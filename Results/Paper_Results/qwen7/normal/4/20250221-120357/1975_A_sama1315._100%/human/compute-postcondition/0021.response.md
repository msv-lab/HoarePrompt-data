Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `idx` is 8 + n + n - 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[idx])`**.

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other variables remain unchanged with their respective conditions and values.
