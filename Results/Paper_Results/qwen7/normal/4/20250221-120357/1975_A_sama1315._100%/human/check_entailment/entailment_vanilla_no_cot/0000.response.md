Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. It checks if the array can be sorted by concatenating the array with itself and looking for a subarray that matches the sorted version of the original array. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the specific operation of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases, but it relies on `func_1` to determine if an array can be sorted using the allowed operation. Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is greater than or equal to the second part in a way that allows the array to be sorted. Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def can_sort_by_splitting(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True

def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n):
        if can_sort_by_splitting(a[i:]):
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This solution checks if the array can be split at any point such that the remaining part can be sorted in non-decreasing order. If such a split exists, the function returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".
