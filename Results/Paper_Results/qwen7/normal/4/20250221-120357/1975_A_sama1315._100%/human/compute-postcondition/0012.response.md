Output State: **`idx` is 7 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` and the new element `result`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The values of `idx` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `results` now contains one additional element, which is `result`.
