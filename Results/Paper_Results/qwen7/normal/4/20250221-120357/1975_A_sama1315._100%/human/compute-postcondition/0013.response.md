Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `idx` is 7 + n
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` and the new element `result`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `idx` remains 7 + n (since it is not part of the loop head)
- `t` must still be greater than 0 (to allow the loop to execute again)
- `results` remains unchanged (since it is not part of the loop head)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`idx` is 7 + n, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` and the new element `result`**
