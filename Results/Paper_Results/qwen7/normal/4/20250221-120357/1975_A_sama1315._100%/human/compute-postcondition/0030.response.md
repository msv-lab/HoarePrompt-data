Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by `t` groups of data. Each group includes an integer `n` (length of an array `a`), and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calls `func_1(a)` for each array `a` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1(a)` for each test case, separated by newlines.**
