### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and the problem requirements step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The goal is to determine if an array can be split into two parts and swapped to make it non-decreasing. The function `func_1` should check if there exists a valid split point such that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing sequence through the allowed operations.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if the array plus itself (`concatenated_a`) contains a subarray that matches the sorted version of the original array (`sorted_a`).
   - This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order. It only checks if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array, which is not sufficient.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to check if there is a valid split point such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the end of the first part is less than or equal to the start of the second part.
   - This can be done by iterating through the array and checking if the maximum value in the left part is less than or equal to the minimum value in the right part for every possible split point.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points, but it does not reflect the actual logic of `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
