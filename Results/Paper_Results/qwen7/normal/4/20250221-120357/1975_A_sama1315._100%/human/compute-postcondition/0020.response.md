Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(t)` part of the for loop. The key variables here are `t` and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 8 + n + n.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`.
   - `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`.
   - `results` is now a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)` appended.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop counter `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time the loop iterates.
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0 (as it is decremented by 1 each iteration).

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, and assuming `t` was decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` must be at least 1 (since it was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration and must still be greater than 0).
- All other variables (`idx`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `result`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `idx` is 8 + n + n, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.
