Output State: **`idx` is 2; `t` is an integer from the list `data` at index 0; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `idx` or `t`. Therefore, `idx` remains 2 and `t` remains as the integer from the list `data` at index 0.
