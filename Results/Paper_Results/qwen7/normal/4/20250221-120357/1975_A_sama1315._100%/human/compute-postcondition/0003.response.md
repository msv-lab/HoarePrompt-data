Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer from the list `data` at index 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from the list `data` at index `idx` (which is 0) to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented by 1 (becoming 1), and `t` now holds the integer value from the first element of the list `data`.
