Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `idx` is 9 + n + n - 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to elements in `data` starting from `data[idx]` and taking `n` elements, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`; `idx` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `idx` is `8 + n + n - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `9 + n + n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
