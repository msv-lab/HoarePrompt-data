Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
   - `s` is 0.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `a` is greater than 0. 

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `a` determines whether the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than 0.
   - The value of `i` will start from 0 and increment in each iteration. However, we don't need to specify the exact initial value of `i` because it will be set to 0 by default when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0**
