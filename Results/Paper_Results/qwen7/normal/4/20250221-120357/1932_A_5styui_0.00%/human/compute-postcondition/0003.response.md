Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `d`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `s` remains 0. The value of `d` is an integer obtained from user input.
