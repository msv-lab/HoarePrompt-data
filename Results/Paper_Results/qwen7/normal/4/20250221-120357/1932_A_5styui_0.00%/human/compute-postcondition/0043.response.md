Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 2 if the character at index `j+2` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j+2` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`. In both cases (whether the if condition is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
