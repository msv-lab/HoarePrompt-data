Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 2 if the character at index `j+2` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j+2` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `s`, or `b`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
