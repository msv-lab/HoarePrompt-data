Output State: **`s` is 3, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is the length of `b`**

Explanation: The initial state defines that `s` is 2 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', otherwise `s` is 1. After executing `s = s + 1`, `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially 2 (if the condition was met) or 1 (if not), it now becomes 3. The value of `j` is updated to `j + 1` as per the initial state, and `i` remains unchanged as it is the length of `b`.
