Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 1 if the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `b` is either '@' or '*' followed by another '*', or the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.
