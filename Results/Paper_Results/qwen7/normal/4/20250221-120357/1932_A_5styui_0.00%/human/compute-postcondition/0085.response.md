Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(len(b)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `b` is a non-empty string with the first character being either '@' or '*'. The condition for breaking the innermost loop or if statement is based on the character at index 1 of `b` being '*'.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - The conditions on `b` (that it is a non-empty string and the first character is either '@' or '*') remain unchanged unless the innermost loop or if statement breaks the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index 0 of `b` is either '@' or '*'**.
