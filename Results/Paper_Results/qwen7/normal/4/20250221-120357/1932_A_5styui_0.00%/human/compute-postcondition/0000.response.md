Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, a is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 1000] and does not depend on the input for `a`, its value remains unchanged. The value of `a` is the integer input provided by the user, which is guaranteed to be between 1 and 50.
