Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `s` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    d = int(input())
    b = input()
    for j in range(len(b)):
        if b[j] == '@':
            s = s + 1
        elif b[j] == '*':
            if b[:]:
                break
            elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                break
    print(s)
    s = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` is greater than 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement whenever a `*` followed by another `*` is encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `b`, and the loop breaks if any '*' character is encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is 0, `j` is 3, `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
