Output State: **`s` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is the length of `b`, `b` is an input string, `d` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `j` was being incremented and where the characters at indices `j` and `j + 1` in string `b` were checked. The values of `s`, `i`, `b`, and `d` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop or conditional block.
