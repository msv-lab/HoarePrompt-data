Output State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0; `j` is incremented by 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variable `s` retains its value based on whether the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '@' or not, `j` is incremented by 1, and the code breaks out of the current loop or if statement it is inside.
