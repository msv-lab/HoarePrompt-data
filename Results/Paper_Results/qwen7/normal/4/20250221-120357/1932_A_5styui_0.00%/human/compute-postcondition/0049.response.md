Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` is greater than 0, `s` is equal to the count of '@' characters in the string `b`, `b` is a non-empty string, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement whenever a `*` followed by another `*` is encountered.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `s` will hold the total count of '@' characters in the string `b`. The loop will break out as soon as it encounters a `*` followed by another `*`, so the loop does not continue to check the rest of the string once this condition is met. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
