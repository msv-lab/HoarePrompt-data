Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` must be greater than 0, `s` is 3 if the character at index `j+2` of `b` is `@`, otherwise `s` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j+2` of `b` is either `@` or `*` followed by another `*`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` was initially set to 2 if the character at index `j+2` of `b` is `@`, otherwise it is 1. After executing `s = s + 1`, `s` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if the character at index `j+2` of `b` was `@`, `s` becomes 3; otherwise, `s` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
