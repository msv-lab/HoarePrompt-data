Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5
- `sum` is 9240

The print statement is:

```python
print(sum, n + n)
```

Given the values:
- `sum` is explicitly stated to be 9240.
- `n` is also explicitly stated to be 5 (since `i` is `n` and the loop increments `i` from 2 to `n`).

Therefore, `n + n` is `5 + 5 = 10`.

So, the print statement will output the value of `sum` (which is 9240) followed by the value of `n + n` (which is 10).

Output: **9240 10**
