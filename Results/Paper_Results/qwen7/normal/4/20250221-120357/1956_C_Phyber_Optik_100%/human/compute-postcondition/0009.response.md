Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`. This means `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `sum` has been updated to its current value plus \(((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1)\).

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 2`, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `sum` remains unchanged as the update happens inside the loop body.
   - `i` changes from its previous value to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
