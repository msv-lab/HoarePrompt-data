Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `i` is initialized to 2 (as per the `range(2, n + 1)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 (this variable is not directly related to the loop execution and does not need to be adjusted).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `sum` is 1 (this variable is not directly related to the loop execution and does not need to be adjusted).

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts with `i = 2`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be at least 2**
