Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged, so the only updated information is that `t` is now an input integer within the specified range.
