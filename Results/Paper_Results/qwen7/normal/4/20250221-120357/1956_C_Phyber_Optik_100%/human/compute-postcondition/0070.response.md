Output State: The loop runs `n` times, starting with `j` set to 1 and incrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration. After all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`, `n` will remain unchanged as it is an input parameter, and `i` will also be `n + 1` since the loop does not change its value directly but `i` is not used in the loop body. Each iteration prints two lines, but these lines do not affect the variables' values.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: `sum` is not defined in this context, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is the original input integer.
