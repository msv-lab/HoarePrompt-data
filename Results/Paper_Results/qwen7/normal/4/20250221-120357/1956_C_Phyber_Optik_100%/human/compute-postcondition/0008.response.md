Output State: **`sum` is updated to its current value plus ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum` by adding the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to its current value. Given the initial condition that `i + 1` must be at least 3, the expression simplifies to `((i + 1) * (i + 1) - i * i) * (i + 1)`. This means `sum` is updated by adding this specific value to its current state. The variable `i` remains unchanged from its previous value, and the precondition that `i + 1` must be at least 3 is still valid.
