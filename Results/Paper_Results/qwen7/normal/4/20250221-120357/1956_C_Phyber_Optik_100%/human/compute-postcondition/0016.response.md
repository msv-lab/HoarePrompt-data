Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The first part of the `print` statement is `2`, which is a constant value.
   - Next, `n - j + 1` is evaluated. Since `j` is 1, this becomes `n - 1 + 1`, simplifying to `n`.
   - Finally, `*range(1, n + 1)` is used to unpack the range object from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Output Description**:
   - The `print` statement will output three parts separated by spaces:
     1. The constant value `2`.
     2. The value of `n` (since `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n`).
     3. All integers from 1 to `n + 1`, inclusive, separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the precise output can be described as follows:

Output: **2, n, 1 2 3 ... n** (where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0)
