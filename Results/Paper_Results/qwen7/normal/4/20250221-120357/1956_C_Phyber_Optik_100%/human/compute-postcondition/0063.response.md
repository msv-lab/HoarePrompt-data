Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop condition.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < n + 1`. This means the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - The variable `j` changes from 1 to 2.
   - The variable `n` remains a positive integer (unchanged).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer**
