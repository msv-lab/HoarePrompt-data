Output State: The final value of `sum` will be the sum of the expression \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To understand this, let's break down the expression inside the loop:

\[
(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i = (i^2 - (i-1)^2) * i = (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) * i = (2i - 1) * i = 2i^2 - i
\]

So, the loop updates `sum` by adding \(2i^2 - i\) for each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). Therefore, the final value of `sum` will be the sum of \(2i^2 - i\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: The value of `sum` will be the sum of the series \(2i^2 - i\) for all integers \(i\) starting from 2 up to the given integer `n`.
