Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 but no explicit value is given.
   - `sum` is explicitly given as 9240.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The first argument to `print` is `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Since `j` is 3, this becomes `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Determination of Values**:
   - The value of `2` is explicitly given.
   - The value of `n - 2` cannot be determined precisely without knowing `n`, but it will be a number greater than or equal to 3 (since `n` is at least 5).
   - The range `1, 2, 3, ..., n` will include all integers from 1 up to `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The output will be a sequence starting with `2`, followed by `n - 2`, and then all integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Given the constraints and the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **2, [n - 2], 1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 5)**
