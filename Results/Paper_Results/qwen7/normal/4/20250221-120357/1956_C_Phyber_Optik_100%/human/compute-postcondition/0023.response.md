Output State: The value of `j` will be `n`, and the loop will have executed `n` times. The variable `n` must be a positive integer.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: After the loop completes, the value of `j` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times, and `n` must be a positive integer.
