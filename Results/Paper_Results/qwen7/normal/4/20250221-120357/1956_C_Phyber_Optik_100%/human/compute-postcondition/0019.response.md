Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down what this will print:

1. `2`: This is directly printed as it is a constant value.
2. `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 2, this expression simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments, starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.

Given these points, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 2, followed by `n - 1`, and then the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

So, the output will be:
Output: **2, n - 1, 1 2 ... n (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
