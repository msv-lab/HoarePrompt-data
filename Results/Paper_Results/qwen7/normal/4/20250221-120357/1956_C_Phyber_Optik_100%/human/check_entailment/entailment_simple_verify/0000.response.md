### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates a sum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
   - This formula simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - Further simplification gives:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i
     \]
   - Using the formulas for the sum of squares and the sum of integers:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}, \quad \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + 2 \left(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} - 1\right) - \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying further, we get:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - 2 - \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{3} - \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - This sum is not related to the problem of maximizing the matrix sum using the allowed operations.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the calculated sum and `2n` as the number of operations.
   - It then prints `2n` operations, each of which is a permutation operation (type 1 and type 2) applied to the same row/column `n - j + 1` for `j` ranging from 1 to `n`.
   - However, these operations do not reflect the required permutations to maximize the matrix sum.

Given the problem constraints and the example provided, the program does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the matrix sum. Instead, it prints a fixed number of operations without actually performing the required permutations.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
