Based on the initial state, the `sum` variable is the sum of the series \(2i^2 - i\) for all integers \(i\) starting from 2 up to the given integer `n`. The `n + n` part simply adds `n` to itself.

Let's break it down:

1. **Sum Calculation**: 
   - For each \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), the term added to `sum` is \(2i^2 - i\).
   - This means `sum` is the sum of \(2i^2 - i\) for \(i = 2, 3, \ldots, n\).

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The first part of the `print` statement is `sum`, which is the sum of the series described above.
   - The second part is `n + n`, which simplifies to \(2n\).

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the series \(2i^2 - i\) for \(i = 2, 3, \ldots, n\) followed by \(2n\).

Output: **sum (which is the sum of the series 2i^2 - i for i = 2 to n), 2n**
