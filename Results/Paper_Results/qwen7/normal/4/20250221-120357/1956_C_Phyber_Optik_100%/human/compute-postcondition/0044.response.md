Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
   - `sum` is 9240.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 3, this becomes `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Determine `n`:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 5 (since the exact value of `n` is not specified but it must satisfy the condition).

5. **Substitute Values:**
   - With `n = 5`:
     - `n - 2` becomes `5 - 2` which is `3`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` becomes `range(1, 6)`, which generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `1`, followed by `3`, and then the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5**
