Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 5
   - `sum` is 24

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 5.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 (which it already is).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 5.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop itself.
   - The `sum` variable is not part of the loop head and is not directly affected by the loop condition, so it remains 24.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 24**
