Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `j` is 2, and `n` must be a positive integer.

4. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration). Therefore, `j` will become 3. However, the value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that changes is `j`, and it becomes 3. The value of `n` remains a positive integer but does not change its requirement.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be a positive integer**
