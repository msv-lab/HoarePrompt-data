State: **`j` is `n+1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240**.

Explanation:
- The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`.
- The variables in the loop head are `t`.
- The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n+1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, and `sum` is 9240.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of `t`, we can only adjust the state based on the condition that the loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 0. However, the states of `j`, `n`, and `sum` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is `n+1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `sum` is 9240**.
