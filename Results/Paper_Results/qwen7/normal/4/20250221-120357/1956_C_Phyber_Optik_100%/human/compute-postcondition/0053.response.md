Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is 7
   - `j` is `n+1`
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `n` (inclusive). 

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop has just started or is about to complete its first iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n >= 2`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sum` remains unchanged at 7.
   - `j` is `n + 1`, so it remains unchanged as well.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`sum` is 7, `j` is `n+1`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
