Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is `-99999999999999999999`, `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, or `999999999999999999` if `i >= n - 1**.

Explanation: The code sets the value of `back` to `-99999999999999999999`. This changes the value of `back` but does not affect the values of `i` or `forward`. The value of `forward` remains dependent on the condition `i < n - 1`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`; otherwise, it is `999999999999999999`.
