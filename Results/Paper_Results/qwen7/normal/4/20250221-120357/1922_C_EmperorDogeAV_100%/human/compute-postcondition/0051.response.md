Functionality: The function accepts a list of city coordinates `cities` and its length `n`. It calculates and returns a new list `prog_cities` where each element (except the first and last) represents the smallest absolute difference between the coordinate of the city at that index and the nearest neighbor's coordinate. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain zero because there is no previous city for the first element and no next city for the last element.
