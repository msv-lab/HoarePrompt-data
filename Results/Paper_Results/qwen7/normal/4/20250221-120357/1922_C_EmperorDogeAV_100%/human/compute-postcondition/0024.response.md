Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is 999999999999999999**

Explanation: The code `back = cities[i - 1]` assigns the value of `cities[i - 1]` to the variable `back`. The value of `i` remains as `i + 1` from the initial state, and `forward` remains unchanged at 999999999999999999.
