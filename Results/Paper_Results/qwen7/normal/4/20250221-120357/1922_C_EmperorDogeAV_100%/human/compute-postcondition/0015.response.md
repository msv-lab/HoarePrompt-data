Output State: **`i` is an integer, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, `back` remains unchanged. `prog_cities[i]` is now 1, and the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**

Explanation: The code sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `back`, or `forward`. The condition about the absolute differences between the values remains unchanged as well.
