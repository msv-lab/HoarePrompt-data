Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `back` is the value of `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is the value of `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, `back` remains unchanged. After executing the if-else block, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it remains unchanged if `i` is not less than `n - 1`.
