#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct indices x and y (1 <= x, y <= n) representing the starting and ending cities for the travel.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `prog_cities` will contain the smallest absolute difference between each city's coordinate and its nearest neighbor's coordinate, with the first and last elements of `prog_cities` remaining as zero since there is no previous city for the first element and no next city for the last element.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element (except the first and last) represents the smallest absolute difference between the coordinate of the city at that index and the nearest neighbor's coordinate. The first and last elements remain zero as there is no previous city for the first element and no next city for the last element.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a list of city coordinates `cities` and its length `n`. It calculates and returns a new list `prog_cities` where each element (except the first and last) represents the smallest absolute difference between the coordinate of the city at that index and the nearest neighbor's coordinate. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain zero because there is no previous city for the first element and no next city for the last element.
