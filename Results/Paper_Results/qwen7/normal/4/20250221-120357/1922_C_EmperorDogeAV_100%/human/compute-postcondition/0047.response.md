Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `prog_cities` will contain the smallest absolute difference between each city's coordinate and its nearest neighbor's coordinate, with the first and last elements of `prog_cities` remaining as zero since there is no previous city for the first element and no next city for the last element.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last ones), calculating the smaller absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and either its preceding or succeeding city's coordinate, whichever is closer. If the forward city is closer, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the forward and current city's coordinates. This process effectively populates `prog_cities` with the minimum distances to the nearest neighbors for each city, except for the boundary conditions where `prog_cities[0]` and `prog_cities[n-1]` remain 0 due to the lack of preceding or succeeding cities, respectively.
