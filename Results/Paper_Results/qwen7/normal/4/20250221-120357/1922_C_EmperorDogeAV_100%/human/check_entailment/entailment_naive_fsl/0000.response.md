Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city. The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city based on the given criteria, but it does not correctly calculate the closest city. Instead, it seems to be calculating the distance to the next and previous cities and choosing the smaller distance, which does not necessarily give the closest city based on the problem description.

For example, consider the cities located in points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem description, the closest city to city 1 is city 2, to city 2 is city 3, to city 3 is city 4, to city 4 is city 3, and to city 5 is city 4. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify these closest cities. It calculates the distances to the next and previous cities and chooses the smaller distance, which does not always give the correct closest city.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:
- For city 1, the distances to the next and previous cities are `8` and `0`, respectively. The function would choose `0`, which is incorrect because the closest city is actually city 2.
- For city 3, the distances to the next and previous cities are `15 - 12 = 3` and `12 - 8 = 4`, respectively. The function would choose `3`, which is correct, but for city 4, the distances are `20 - 15 = 5` and `15 - 12 = 3`, and the function would choose `5`, which is incorrect because the closest city is city 3.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city, making it incorrect.
