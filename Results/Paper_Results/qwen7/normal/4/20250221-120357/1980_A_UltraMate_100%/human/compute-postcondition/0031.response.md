Output State: **`ans` is the original value plus `m` minus `hmp[i]`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its original value. The variable `i` remains as the next key in `hmp`, and the precondition that `hmp` contains at least one element is still valid.
