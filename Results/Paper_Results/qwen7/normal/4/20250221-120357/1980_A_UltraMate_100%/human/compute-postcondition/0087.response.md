Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `p` that have not been processed yet.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the next element in `p` after 'A'.
   - `i` is not in `hmp`.
   - `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`.

4. **Determine the changes for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `p` after 'A', and it is not in `hmp`, the loop will continue to process the next element in `p`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `p` after the current `i`.
   - `p` will be updated to exclude the current `i`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `p` after the current `i`.
   - `p` will be the remaining elements in `p` after removing the current `i`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the addition of `m` (as per the given information).

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `p` after the current `i`, `p` is the list of elements in `p` excluding the current `i`, `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`**.
