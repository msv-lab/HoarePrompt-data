Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `hmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `hmp`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `hmp` must contain at least one element.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is that all characters in the string `p` ('ABCDEFG') have been iterated over, and `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (which is 0) plus `m` for each iteration where the character is not found in `hmp`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop iterates over `hmp`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `hmp`. Specifically, `hmp` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **Final State**: Given that `ans` is initialized to 0 and incremented by `m` for each character in `p` not found in `hmp`, the state of `ans` does not need to be adjusted because it will be updated within the loop based on the contents of `hmp`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `hmp` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**State: **`hmp` must contain at least one element**
