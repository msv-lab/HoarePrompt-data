Output State: **`i` is the first key in `hmp`, `ans` is `ans + m - hmp[i]`, `hmp` retains its state from the last iteration, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `m`, `n`, `t`, `s`, and `hmp` retain their states from the last iteration.**

In this step, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. The variable `i` remains unchanged, as does `hmp`, `p`, `m`, `n`, `t`, and `s`. The precondition that `hmp[i]` is less than `m` still holds true.
