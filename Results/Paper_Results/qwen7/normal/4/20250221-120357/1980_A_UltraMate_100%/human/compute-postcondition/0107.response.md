Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`.

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `ans` will hold the total increment it received, which is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for every key `i` in the dictionary `hmp` where the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If there are no such keys, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.
