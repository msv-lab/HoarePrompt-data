Output State: **`hmp` has at least one element, `i` is the third element of `hmp`, and `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if the third element of `hmp` is less than `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.**

This means that the third element of `hmp` (which is referenced by `i`) is subtracted from `m`, and the result is added to `ans` only if the third element of `hmp` is less than `m`. If the third element of `hmp` is not less than `m`, then `ans` remains unchanged.
