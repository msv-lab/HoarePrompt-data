Output State: **`hmp` has at least one element, `i` is the second element of `hmp`, and `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it. This operation only happens if `hmp[i] < m`. If `hmp[i]` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `m - hmp[i]` would be a negative number or zero, and adding this to `ans` would either decrease its value or keep it unchanged. The values of `hmp` and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
