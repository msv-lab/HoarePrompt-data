Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all elements `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i] < m`. The value of `ans` does not change if `hmp[i] >= m`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will have been incremented by `m - hmp[i]` for each key `i` in `hmp` where the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If the value of `hmp[i]` is greater than or equal to `m`, then no increment occurs for that particular key. Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the total of these increments across all keys in `hmp`.
