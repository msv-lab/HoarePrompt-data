Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will have accumulated the difference `(m - hmp[i])` for every key `i` in `hmp` where the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If `hmp[i]` is greater than or equal to `m`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged for that iteration. Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the sum of these differences for all elements in `hmp`.
