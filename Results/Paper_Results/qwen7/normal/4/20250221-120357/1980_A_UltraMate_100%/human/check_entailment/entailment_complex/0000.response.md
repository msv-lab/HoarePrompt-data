Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), followed by the string \( a \).

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string \( a \).

3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - For each difficulty level, if it is missing (not in the counter), the program adds \( m \) to the answer (`ans`), indicating that Vlad needs to create all \( m \) problems of that difficulty.
   - If the difficulty level is present but its count is less than \( m \), the program adds the difference \( m - \text{count}(i) \) to `ans`, indicating the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Given the provided example and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly computes the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold \( m \) rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level.

Correctness: **True**
