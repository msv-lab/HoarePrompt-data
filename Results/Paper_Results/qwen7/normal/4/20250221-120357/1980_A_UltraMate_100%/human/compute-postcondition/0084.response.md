Output State: **`i` is the next element in `p` after 'A', `i` is not in `hmp`, and `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. The other variables (`i` and `hmp`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
