Output State: **`c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `c0` is equal to `coef0[j]` where `j` is 0 since `i` is 2 and `coef0[1]` is 0, thus `c0` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `c0 += coef0[j]` increments `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`. Given that `i` is 2, `j` would be 2-1 = 1, but `coef0[1]` is 0, so `c0` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
