Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least three elements; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ok = ok or c1 != 0` checks if `c1` is not equal to 0. If `c1` is not 0, `ok` is set to True. If `c1` is already True or 0, `ok` remains unchanged. Since `c1` is defined as the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, the only change here is potentially setting `ok` to True if `c1` is not 0.
