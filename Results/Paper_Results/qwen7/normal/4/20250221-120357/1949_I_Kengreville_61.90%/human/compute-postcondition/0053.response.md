Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one element, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the current element in the `nodes` list**

Explanation: The code `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by `coef1[j]`, where `j` is the current element in the `nodes` list. The initial state of `nodes` having at least one element remains unchanged. The state of `c0` is also unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
