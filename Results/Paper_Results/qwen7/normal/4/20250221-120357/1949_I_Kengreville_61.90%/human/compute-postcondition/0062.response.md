Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least three elements, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `coef0[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `coef0[i]` to 0. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`nodes`, `c1`, `ok`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
