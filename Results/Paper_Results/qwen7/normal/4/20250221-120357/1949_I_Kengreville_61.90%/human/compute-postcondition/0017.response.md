Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`; `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` assigns the negation of the value of `coef1[i]` to `coef1[j]`. The values of `dx`, `dy`, and `coef0[j]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
