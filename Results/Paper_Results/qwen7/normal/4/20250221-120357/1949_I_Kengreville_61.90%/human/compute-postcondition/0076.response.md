Output State: **`c0` is 1 + `coef0[j]`, `c1` is 2, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `j` is the next element in `nodes` (after the previous `j`), `nodes` has one less element**.

Explanation: The value of `c1` is updated by adding `coef1[j]` to its current value. Given that `c1` was initially `1 + coef1[j]` and `coef1[1]` is 1, the new value of `c1` becomes `1 + coef1[j] + 1`. Since `j` is the next element in `nodes` after the previous `j`, and `nodes` has one less element, the value of `c1` simplifies to `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
