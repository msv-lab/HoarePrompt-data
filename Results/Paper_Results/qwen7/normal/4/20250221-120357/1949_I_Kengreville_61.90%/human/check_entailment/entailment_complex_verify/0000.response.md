### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Tangency Condition**: The program must correctly identify pairs of disks that are tangent to each other.
2. **Radii Reduction**: The program must ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.
3. **Graph Traversal**: The program should traverse the graph of disks to find connected components where the sum of the radii can be reduced.

#### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes several lists and arrays to store disk information and states.
   - The `dfs` function is used to perform a depth-first search to explore the graph of disks.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - The `dfs` function checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the squared distance between their centers with the sum of their radii.
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values based on the difference in radii.
   - The `dfs` function recursively visits all connected disks, updating the `visited` list and the `nodes` list.

3. **Main Function (func_1)**:
   - The main function iterates over each disk and performs a DFS if the disk has not been visited.
   - After the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef1` for all nodes in the connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The `coef0` and `coef1` values are updated based on the difference in radii when two disks are tangent. However, these values are not directly used to reduce the radii.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the new radii result in a strictly decreasing sum of radii.

2. **Sum of Radii Check**:
   - The program does not verify if the new radii configuration results in a strictly decreasing sum of radii.
   - The `dfs` function only ensures tangency and updates coefficients, but it does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.

3. **Connected Components**:
   - The program identifies connected components using DFS, but it does not ensure that the sum of radii in these components can be reduced.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks as described. Specifically, it does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency conditions. The program only checks for tangency and updates coefficients without ensuring the desired outcome.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
