Output State: **`coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `visited[j]` must be false, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `coef1[j]` to be the negation of `coef1[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
