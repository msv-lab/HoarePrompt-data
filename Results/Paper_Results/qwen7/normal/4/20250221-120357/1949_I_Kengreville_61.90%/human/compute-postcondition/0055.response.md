Output State: **`nodes` must have at least two elements, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` where `j` is the first element in the updated `nodes` list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c0` by adding `coef0[j]`, where `j` is the first element in the `nodes` list. The initial conditions about `nodes` having at least two elements and `c1` being increased by `coef1[j]` (where `j` is the first element in the updated `nodes` list) remain valid, but now `c0` has also been updated according to the new value of `j`.
