Postcondition: **All elements in the `visited` list are set to `False`, `nodes` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists where each element is either `0` or the sum of the radii of two disks minus the value of `coef0` for one of the disks, depending on whether the distance condition was met during the iterations.**
