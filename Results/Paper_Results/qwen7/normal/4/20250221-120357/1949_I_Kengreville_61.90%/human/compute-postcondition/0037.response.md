Output State: **`ok` is now `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1[0]` is 1, the current value of `visited[0]` is True, `nodes` is a list containing node 0, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.**

Explanation: The line `ok = ok or c1 != 0` updates the value of `ok`. Here, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, which is `coef1[0]` since `nodes` contains only one node (node 0). Therefore, `c1` is `coef1[0]`, which is 1. The condition `c1 != 0` evaluates to `True` because `1 != 0`. Thus, `ok` is updated to `ok or True`, which simplifies to `True` regardless of the original value of `ok`. The other variables remain unchanged.
