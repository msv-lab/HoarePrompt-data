You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

    0 2 1
    
    0 0 1
    
    4 -3 4

    11 5 2

    YES

    7 7 2
    
    2 7 3

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

First sample (left) and a valid way to change the radii of the disks (right).

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

Second sample.
Program:
```
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
```
