Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly formats the query and prints it, then reads the user's response. However, it does not validate the user's response to ensure it matches the expected format. This is not a critical flaw since the problem statement assumes valid inputs.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The first loop (`for i in range(1, n)`): This loop aims to find the index `max_item_idx` such that the bitwise OR of the elements at `max_item_idx` with itself is the highest possible. This is a valid approach to identify a potential candidate for the maximum XOR pair.
   - The second loop (`for i in range(n)`): This loop further refines the search for the optimal pair `(max_item_idx, pair_idx)` by comparing the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with `pair_idx` against the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with each `i`. The logic here is flawed:
     - If `ans1 == '<'`, it sets `pair_idx` to `i`. This is correct.
     - If `ans1 == '='`, it further checks `ans2` to decide whether to set `pair_idx` to `i`. However, this additional check is unnecessary and potentially misleading. The correct approach should be to directly set `pair_idx` to `i` when `ans1 == '='` because we are looking for the maximum XOR, and equality in the OR operation does not necessarily mean the XOR is maximal.
   - The final print statement `! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}` outputs the indices of the pair, but due to the flawed logic in the second loop, the pair might not be the optimal one.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_2` does not guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR value due to the flawed logic in the second loop.

Correctness: **False**
