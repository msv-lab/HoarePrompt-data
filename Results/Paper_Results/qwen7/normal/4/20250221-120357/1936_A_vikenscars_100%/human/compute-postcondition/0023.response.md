Output State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is '<', `pair_idx` is 0**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `pair_idx` to the value of `i`. Initially, `i` is 0. Therefore, after executing `pair_idx = i`, the value of `pair_idx` changes to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
