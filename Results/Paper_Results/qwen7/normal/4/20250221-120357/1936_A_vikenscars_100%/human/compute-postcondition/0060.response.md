Based on the initial state provided:

- `max_item_idx` remains 0 after all iterations.
- `pair_idx` is set to the last index `i`, which is `n-1`.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- The value of `ans1` is determined by the return value of `func_1(0, n-1, 0, n-1)`.
- If `ans1` equals `'<'`, it remains `'<'`.
- If `ans1` equals `'='` and `ans2` (the return value of `func_1(n-1, n-1, n-1, n-1)`) equals `'>'`, `ans1` remains `'='`.
- Otherwise, `ans1` is `'='`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

- `max_item_idx` is explicitly stated to remain 0.
- `pair_idx` is explicitly stated to be `n-1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

Substituting the known values:
- `max_item_idx` is 0.
- `pair_idx` is `n-1`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **! 0 n-1**
