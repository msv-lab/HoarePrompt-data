Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`
   - The postcondition is that if `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)` equals `<`, the loop continues.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `max_item_idx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` is `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**
