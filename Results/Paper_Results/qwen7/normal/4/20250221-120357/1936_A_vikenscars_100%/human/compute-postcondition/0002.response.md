Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function call `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` to the variable `ans`. Given the initial values, `max_item_idx` is 0 and `i` is 1, these values are passed into the function. Since the function name and its implementation are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the result of calling `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 1 and `max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1 remain unchanged.
