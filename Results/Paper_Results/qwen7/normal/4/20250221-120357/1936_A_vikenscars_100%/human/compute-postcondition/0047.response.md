Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` remains 0 (unchanged).
   - `pair_idx` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(0, 1, 0, 1)`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which is `2`.

5. **Determine the New Condition for `n`**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now `2`, `n` must be greater than `2`.

6. **Adjust the States**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to update these variables.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `max_item_idx` remains unchanged at 0.
- `pair_idx` remains unchanged at 1.
- `i` is updated to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

**State:**
**`max_item_idx` is 0, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
