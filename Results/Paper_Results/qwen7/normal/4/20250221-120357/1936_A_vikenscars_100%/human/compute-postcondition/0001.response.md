State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start with `i` set to 1 and increment `i` until `i` is less than `n`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`.
4. The initial value of `max_item_idx` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution condition directly, but it is included in the state for completeness.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `max_item_idx` remains 0.
