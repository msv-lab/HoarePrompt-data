Output State: **`max_item_idx` remains 0, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(0, 1, 0, 1)`, `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code sets `pair_idx` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pair_idx` is updated to 1, while `max_item_idx`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` retain their original values.
