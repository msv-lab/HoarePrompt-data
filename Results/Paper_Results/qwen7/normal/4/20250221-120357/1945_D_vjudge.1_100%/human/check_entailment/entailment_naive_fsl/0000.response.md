Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. Specifically, the program does not consider the cost of bribing people between the positions where Kirill moves. 

Let's consider an example:

Input:
```
3 2
7 3 6
4 3 8
```

Expected Output:
```
7
```

Explanation:
- Initially, Kirill is at position 3.
- He can bribe the person at position 2, paying `b[1] = 4` coins, and move to position 2.
- Now, he has to pay `a[2] = 3` coins to bribe the person at position 1 and move to position 1.
- Total cost: `4 + 3 = 7`.

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly. It only considers the cost of moving to the current position and the cost of bribing the person immediately before, without considering the cumulative cost of bribing all intermediate people.

The program should maintain a running total of the costs of bribing all intermediate people and update the answer accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    func_1(n, k, a, b)

def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
    
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        cost = 0
        for j in range(i + 1):
            cost += c[j]
        ans = min(ans, cost + suff[i + 1])
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version maintains a running total of the costs of bribing all intermediate people and ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
