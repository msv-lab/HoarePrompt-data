You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `0`; `suff[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. By the end of the loop, when `i` becomes `0`, `suff[0]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c` because each `c[i]` is added to the running total as `i` decreases from `n-1` to `0`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `ans` is the minimum value obtained from the expression `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range of `k`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must be at least 3, `suff[0]` remains the sum of all elements in the list `c`, and `ans` holds the smallest value among `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for i in the range from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where `suff` is a list representing the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The function then prints and returns this minimum value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. Specifically, the program does not consider the cost of bribing people between the positions where Kirill moves. 

Let's consider an example:

Input:
```
3 2
7 3 6
4 3 8
```

Expected Output:
```
7
```

Explanation:
- Initially, Kirill is at position 3.
- He can bribe the person at position 2, paying `b[1] = 4` coins, and move to position 2.
- Now, he has to pay `a[2] = 3` coins to bribe the person at position 1 and move to position 1.
- Total cost: `4 + 3 = 7`.

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly. It only considers the cost of moving to the current position and the cost of bribing the person immediately before, without considering the cumulative cost of bribing all intermediate people.

The program should maintain a running total of the costs of bribing all intermediate people and update the answer accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    func_1(n, k, a, b)

def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
    
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        cost = 0
        for j in range(i + 1):
            cost += c[j]
        ans = min(ans, cost + suff[i + 1])
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version maintains a running total of the costs of bribing all intermediate people and ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
