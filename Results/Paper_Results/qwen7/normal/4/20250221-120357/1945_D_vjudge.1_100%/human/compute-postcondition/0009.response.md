Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `0`; `suff[0]` will be the sum of all elements in the list `c`.

Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. By the end of the loop, when `i` becomes `0`, `suff[0]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c` because each `c[i]` is added to the running total as `i` decreases from `n-1` to `0`.
