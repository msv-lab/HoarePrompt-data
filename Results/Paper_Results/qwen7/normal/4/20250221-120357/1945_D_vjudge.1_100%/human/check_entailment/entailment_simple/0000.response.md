Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Computation of Minimum Cost**:
   - The program computes the cost array `c` where `c[i] = min(a[i], b[i])` for each position `i` in the queue. This step is correct as it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to swap positions with each person in front of him.
   - A suffix sum array `suff` is computed to store the cumulative sum of costs from the current position to the end of the queue. This is done correctly using the reverse loop from `n-1` to `0`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost. It is updated in the loop where it considers the cost of moving Kirill to each of the first `k` positions, which involves adding `a[i]` (cost to move to position `i`) and `suff[i+1]` (cost to move all subsequent people to their new positions).
   - The loop iterates through the first `k` positions and updates `ans` with the minimum value found.

3. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost `ans` for each test case, which is correct based on the logic implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
