Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`; `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `suff[i]` to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. Initially, `suff[i]` was `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`. After the update, `suff[i]` becomes `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2] + c[n - 2]`, which simplifies to `suff[n - 1] + 2 * c[n - 2]`. However, since we are instructed to use specific values or expressions directly, we express `suff[i]` as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`, where `i + 1` is `n - 1` and `c[i]` is `c[n - 2]`. Thus, the updated value of `suff[i]` is `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
