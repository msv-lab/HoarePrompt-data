Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `suff[i]` to be the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. Since `i` was initially `n - 1`, it remains unchanged. The value of `suff[i]` is now determined by the previous value of `suff[i + 1]` (which is `n - i - 1`) plus `c[i]`. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
