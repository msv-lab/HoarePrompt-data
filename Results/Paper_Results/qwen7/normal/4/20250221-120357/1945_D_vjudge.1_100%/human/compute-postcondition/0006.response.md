Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - 3`.
   - The value of `suff[i]` will be updated based on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact new value of `suff[i]` without knowing the loop body. However, we know that `suff[i]` will be `suff[i + 1] + c[i]` after the loop body executes.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n - 3`.
   - `suff[i]` will be `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`, where `i + 1` is now `n - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `suff[i]` is `suff[n - 2] + c[n - 3]**
