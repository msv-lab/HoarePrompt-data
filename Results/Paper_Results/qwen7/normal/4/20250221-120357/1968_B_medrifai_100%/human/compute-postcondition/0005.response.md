Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `a` and `b` (binary strings), and `i` and `j` (non-negative integers). It searches for the character at index `i` in string `a` within the substring of string `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the index `j` plus the position of the character within the substring of `b`. If the character is not found, it returns -1.**
