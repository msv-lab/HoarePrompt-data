Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons. Here's why:

1. **Space Calculation**: The program calculates `space_x` as `x * 1` and `space_y` as `y * 4`, which is correct since a 1x1 icon takes 1 cell and a 2x2 icon takes 4 cells. However, the total space calculation should consider the entire grid capacity, which is 15 cells per screen (5 rows * 3 columns).

2. **Screen Requirement Calculation for 2x2 Icons**: The program calculates `screen_require_for_y` as `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` based on whether `y` is even or odd. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and we need to ensure that the placement of these icons doesn't exceed the screen capacity.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The program calculates `remaining_cells` as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the actual remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Extra Space Calculation**: The program calculates `extra_space` and `extra_screen` incorrectly. It assumes that the remaining space can be filled perfectly by additional 1x1 icons, but this is not always true.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:
- Calculate the total number of cells needed for both types of icons.
- Determine how many full screens are required to fit the 2x2 icons.
- Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Determine how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_cells_needed = x + 4 * y
        screens_needed = (total_cells_needed + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division to get the number of screens
        result.append(screens_needed)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This approach ensures that the total number of cells needed is calculated correctly, and the number of screens required is determined using ceiling division to account for any remaining cells that would require an additional screen.
