Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`**.

The code multiplies `x` by 1, which does not change its value. Therefore, `space_x` is assigned the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
