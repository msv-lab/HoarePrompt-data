Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells on a screen must be filled before moving to the next screen. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input `x = 12` and `y = 4`. According to the problem, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2. 

- 4 icons of size 2x2 occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells.
- Since each screen has 15 cells, we need at least 2 screens to accommodate these 16 cells (one full screen and one partial screen).

However, the program calculates the space required and the number of screens needed incorrectly. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `space_x = x * 1 = 12` (cells occupied by 1x1 icons).
2. `space_y = y * 4 = 16` (cells occupied by 2x2 icons).
3. `total_space = space_y + space_x = 28` (total cells occupied).
4. `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1 = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 icons of 2x2 require 2 full screens and 1 partial screen).

The program then calculates the remaining cells and checks if the remaining cells can fit the 1x1 icons. However, this approach does not correctly handle the placement of icons on the screens. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that we fill each screen completely before moving to the next one. The correct approach would involve calculating how many full screens are needed for the 2x2 icons and then checking if the remaining cells can fit the 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_y = y // 2
        remaining_2x2 = y % 2
        # Calculate the number of cells used by 2x2 icons
        cells_used_by_2x2 = full_screens_for_y * 4 + (remaining_2x2 * 4)
        # Calculate the remaining cells on the screen
        remaining_cells = 15 - cells_used_by_2x2
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining cells
        icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells = min(x, remaining_cells)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_x = (x - icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells) // 15
        if (x - icons_fitting_in_remaining_cells) % 15 != 0:
            additional_screens_for_x += 1
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = full_screens_for_y + additional_screens_for_x
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the 2x2 icons are placed optimally and the remaining cells are filled with 1x1 icons, thus providing the correct minimum number of screens required.
