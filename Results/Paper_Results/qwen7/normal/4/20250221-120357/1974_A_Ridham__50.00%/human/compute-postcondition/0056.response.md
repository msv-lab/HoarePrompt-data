Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing three elements (the first two being `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and the third element being `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is either `space_x // 15` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` based on the condition `space_x % 15 == 0`.**

Explanation:
- The line `result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)` appends the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to the list `result`.
- Since `result` was initially a list containing two elements (`screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`), after appending, it now contains three elements: `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
