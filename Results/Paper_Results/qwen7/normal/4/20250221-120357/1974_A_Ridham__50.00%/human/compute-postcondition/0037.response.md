Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` which is just `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15`**

Explanation: The code `extra_screen = space_x // 15` assigns the value of `space_x // 15` to the variable `extra_screen`. Since `space_x` is equal to `x * 1` (which simplifies to `x`), `extra_screen` is now `x // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
