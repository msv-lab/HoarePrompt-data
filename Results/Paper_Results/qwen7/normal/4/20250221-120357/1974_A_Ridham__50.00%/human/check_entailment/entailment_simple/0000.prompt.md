Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Note

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `n` has been reduced to 0. At this point, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is 0. The `result` list contains all the elements added during each iteration of the loop, which can be either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` depending on the conditions met during each iteration. `space_x` and `space_y` are updated according to the last iteration's input values `x` and `y`, and `total_space` is the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `extra_screen` is determined based on whether `space_x` is divisible by 15 or not.
    #
    #In summary, the final `result` list will contain up to `n` elements, each either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, with `t` and `n` adjusted accordingly, and `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `extra_screen` reflecting the last iteration's input values.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: \n'.join(map(str, result)) (where result is a list containing elements that are either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y, with screen_require_for_y calculated as y // 2 if y is even, or y // 2 + 1 if y is odd, and extra_screen determined based on whether space_x is divisible by 15 or not)
