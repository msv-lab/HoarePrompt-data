Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on certain conditions involving \(x\) and \(y\), and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints the elements of the list, each representing the number of screens required for the respective test case.**
