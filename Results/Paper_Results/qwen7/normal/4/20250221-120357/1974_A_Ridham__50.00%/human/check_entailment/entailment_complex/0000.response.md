Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly calculates the space required for icons of different sizes:
   - `space_x = x * 1` accounts for the space required by 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4` accounts for the space required by 2x2 icons.
3. It calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`), ensuring that if `y` is odd, an additional screen is used.
4. The program then calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons and checks if the remaining space can accommodate all 1x1 icons.
5. If the remaining space is sufficient, it uses the existing screens. Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
6. The logic for determining the number of additional screens is correct, as it considers both exact divisibility by 15 and the remainder when dividing by 15.
7. The final results are stored in a list and printed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
