State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` (a placeholder variable) and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The variable `t` is not used within the loop condition or directly controlling the loop's execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `result` being an empty list is a given state and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring `n` is greater than 0.
