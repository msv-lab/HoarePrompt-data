Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the provided code structure, the function does not explicitly accept any parameters. The constraints mentioned (t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99) suggest that these might be part of a larger context or setup outside the function itself. Since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, it implies that the function does not take any inputs from the caller and hence does not return anything either.
