Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1 (now `n - 1`), `result` is a list containing two elements, either `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 8`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `x` and `y` are updated to the integer values entered by the user, and `space_x` is now `x * 1`.**

Explanation: The code `space_x = x * 1` updates the value of `space_x` to be exactly `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
