Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.
3. The logic for calculating the number of screens needed is as follows:
   - `space_x = x * 1` calculates the total space needed for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4` calculates the total space needed for 2x2 icons.
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x` calculates the total space needed for both types of icons.
   - `screen_require_for_y` calculates the minimum number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, ensuring that any leftover space from 2x2 icons is accounted for.
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If the remaining space is sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons (`if space_x <= remaining_cells:`), then the number of screens needed is just `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`), and adds these to `screen_require_for_y`.

4. The program correctly handles the edge cases where `y` is odd and where `space_x` is not perfectly divisible by 15.

5. The output is formatted correctly, printing each result on a new line.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place all icons.

Correctness: **True**
