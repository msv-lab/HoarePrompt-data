Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x**.**

This means that the variable `total_space` has been calculated as the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. Since `space_y` is `y * 4` and `space_x` is `x`, `total_space` is `y * 4 + x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
