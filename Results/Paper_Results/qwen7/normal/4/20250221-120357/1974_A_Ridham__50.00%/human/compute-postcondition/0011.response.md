Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `y` is an odd number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` calculates the value of `screen_require_for_y` based on the value of `y`. Since `y` is an odd number, `y // 2` (integer division) will give half of `y` rounded down, and adding 1 to that result gives `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
