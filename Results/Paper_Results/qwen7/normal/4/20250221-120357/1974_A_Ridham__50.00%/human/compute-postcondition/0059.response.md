Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `n` has been reduced to 0. At this point, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is 0. The `result` list contains all the elements added during each iteration of the loop, which can be either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` depending on the conditions met during each iteration. `space_x` and `space_y` are updated according to the last iteration's input values `x` and `y`, and `total_space` is the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, and `extra_screen` is determined based on whether `space_x` is divisible by 15 or not.

In summary, the final `result` list will contain up to `n` elements, each either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, with `t` and `n` adjusted accordingly, and `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `extra_screen` reflecting the last iteration's input values.
