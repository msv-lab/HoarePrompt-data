Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `pattern` is a list with elements 'B', 'AB'[i % 2]**.

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2]` to the `pattern` list. Since `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `i % 2` will either be 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd. This means `pattern` will get appended with either 'A' or 'B'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `pattern` gains an additional element based on the value of `i % 2`.
