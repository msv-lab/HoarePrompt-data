Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. This means `t` is a positive integer that is one less than some positive integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is equal to `n // 2`, meaning `i` is the integer division of `n` by 2.
- `pattern` is a list where every even index contains 'A' and every odd index contains 'B'. The length of this list depends on the value of `n`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, or the contents of `pattern`.

Output: **NO**
