Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
