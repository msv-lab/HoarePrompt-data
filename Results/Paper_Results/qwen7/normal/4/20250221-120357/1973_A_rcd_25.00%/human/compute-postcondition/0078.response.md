Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are set to the integers entered by the user.
