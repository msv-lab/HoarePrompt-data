Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `high`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, since the condition `high >= cur` is no longer satisfied (i.e., `high < cur`), the loop terminates. The final value of `cur` will be `high` because it increments by 1 each time the condition `high >= cur` is met, until `cur` surpasses `high`. At that point, the `else` block is executed, printing `p3` but the value of `cur` remains `high`.
