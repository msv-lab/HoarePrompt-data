Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low + 1`, and `(p1 - (low + 1) > p2 - (p3 - (low + 1)))`**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` was equal to `low`. After executing the code, `cur` becomes `low + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
