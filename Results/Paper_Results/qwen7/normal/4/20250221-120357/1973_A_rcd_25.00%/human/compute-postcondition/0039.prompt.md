Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, `cur` is equal to `low`.
Code of the loop:
while high >= cur:
    if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
        print(p1 - cur + p3)
        break
    else:
        cur += 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)` or greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `high` must be greater than `cur`. After the if-else block executes, either `cur` is increased by 1 or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `cur` is increased by 1 if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is false. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and all other variables retain their initial state.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
