To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `high >= cur`.

Let's break down the relevant states and conditions:

1. **`high`**: The loop continues as long as `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.
2. **`cur`**: The value of `cur` can change inside the loop body, but we don't know how it changes without seeing the loop body. However, since the loop can continue only if `high >= cur`, we need to ensure this condition holds true.

Given the constraints:
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur` for the loop to continue.
- `cur` can increase by 1, break out of the loop, or remain unchanged within the loop body.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `high >= cur` remains true. This means we need to adjust `high` or `cur` such that this condition holds.

Since `cur` can change, we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to the new value of `cur` after the loop body executes. Therefore, the key adjustment is to ensure `high` is greater than or equal to the minimum possible value of `cur` after the loop body.

Given the problem constraints, the most critical state to adjust is `high` to ensure it remains greater than or equal to `cur`.

**State:**
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`**
