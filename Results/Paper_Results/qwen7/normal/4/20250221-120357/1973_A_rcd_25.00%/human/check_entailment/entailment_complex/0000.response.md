Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved by any combination of wins and draws.
3. If the sum is even, it proceeds to check if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws if no games resulted in a win for either player (all games were draws).
4. If the above condition is false, it enters a binary search-like process to find the maximum number of draws. This involves setting `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p2`. It then iteratively checks if the current guess (`cur`) satisfies the condition that the difference in scores between the players can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.
5. The logic within the while loop correctly adjusts the value of `cur` to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the conditions.
6. After processing all test cases, the function exits, and the output reflects the correct calculations for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
