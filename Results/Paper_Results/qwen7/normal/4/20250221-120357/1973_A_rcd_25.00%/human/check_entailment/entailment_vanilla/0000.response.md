Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players).

3. **Initial Check for Consistency:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2` directly. This check is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws.

4. **Finding Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by setting up a range for `cur` from `low` to `high`.
   - `low` and `high` are calculated based on the differences between `p3` and `p1` and `p2`.
   - The program then iterates over this range to find the maximum number of draws where the conditions are satisfied.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Initial Check:**
   - The initial check `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` is incorrect. This condition does not guarantee consistency; it only checks a specific edge case.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):` might not always hold true for valid configurations of games and draws.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the scores are inconsistent but should return `-1`. For example, the scores `1, 1, 10` are inconsistent because they cannot be achieved through any combination of wins and draws.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Ensure the total points are even.
2. Check if the scores are consistent.
3. Calculate the maximum number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check if the scores are consistent
        if p3 > p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        total_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        max_draws = 0
        for d in range(total_games + 1):
            w = total_games - d
            if p1 >= w and p2 >= w and p3 >= w + d:
                max_draws = d
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws and does not correctly handle all edge cases. The corrected program ensures that the scores are consistent and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.

**Correctness:** **False**
