Based on the initial state provided, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned from the input split by spaces. The code snippet `print(p1 + p2)` will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

However, the condition mentioned (if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues the loop; if the sum is even, no additional operations are performed) does not affect the execution of the `print(p1 + p2)` statement directly. This condition only influences whether the loop continues or not but does not alter the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` after they have been assigned.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are the integers assigned from the input split by spaces)**
