Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final value of `cur` is `high + 1`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `high >= cur` becomes false because `cur` has been incremented until it reaches `high + 1`. Since the loop exits without breaking inside the while block, the else clause is executed, printing `p3`. Therefore, the final state of the variable `cur` is `high + 1`, and no other variables are changed during the loop's execution.
