Reasoning:
1. The program correctly checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If it is not, the program prints \(-1\) and continues to the next test case, which is correct because an odd sum would make it impossible to achieve the given scores with the rules provided.
2. If the sum is even, the program proceeds to check if \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\). If this condition is true, it prints \(p_1 + p_2\). This is correct because if \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\), it means that the third player must have won all games they played, and the first and second players' scores add up to the remaining points.
3. If the condition \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\) is false, the program calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of draws using `low` and `high`. It then iterates to find the maximum number of draws such that the first player's score minus the number of draws is less than or equal to the second player's score minus the total number of draws plus \(p_3\). If it finds such a value, it prints the result; otherwise, it prints \(p_3\).

Given the logic and the constraints, the program appears to be handling the problem correctly based on the provided execution summary and the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
