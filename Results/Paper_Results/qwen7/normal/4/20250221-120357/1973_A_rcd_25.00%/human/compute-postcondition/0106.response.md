Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `cur` equals `high + 1`.
