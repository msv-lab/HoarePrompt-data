Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Score Validation**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw).

3. **Score Consistency Check**: The program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws if all games resulted in draws. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of some wins and draws. For example, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the correct maximum number of draws is 2 (one draw between `p1` and `p2`, and one win for `p3` over either `p1` or `p2`), but the current logic would incorrectly print `2`.

4. **Binary Search for Draws**: The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws using a binary search approach. However, the implementation is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not correctly formulated to ensure that the number of draws is maximized. The logic should consider the possible distribution of wins and draws more carefully.

5. **Output Handling**: The program prints the result for each test case and handles the end of the loop correctly.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect due to the flawed logic for determining the maximum number of draws.

Correctness: **False**
