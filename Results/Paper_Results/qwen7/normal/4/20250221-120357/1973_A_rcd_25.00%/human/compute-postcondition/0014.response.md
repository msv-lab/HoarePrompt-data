Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`.**

This means that the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` retain their initial values and conditions. The new variables `low` and `high` are defined based on the comparison between `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. Specifically, `low` takes the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` takes the maximum of these two values.
