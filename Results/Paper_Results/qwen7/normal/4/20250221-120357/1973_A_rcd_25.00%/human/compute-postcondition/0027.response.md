Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `high` must be greater than `cur`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement to be executed is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:

- `p1` and `p3` are explicitly defined as part of the input.
- `cur` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be a variable that is implicitly defined or assumed to have a specific value. Since no other context is provided, we assume `cur` is a variable that needs to be considered in the calculation but its exact value is not specified.

However, the key point here is the relationship between `low` and `high`:
- `low` is defined as `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the opposite of `low`, and `high` must be greater than `cur`.

From the definition of `low` and `high`, we know:
- If `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2`, then `low = p3 - p1` and `high = p3 - p2`.
- If `p3 - p1 >= p3 - p2`, then `low = p3 - p2` and `high = p3 - p1`.

Since `high` must be greater than `cur`, and `high` is either `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2`, we can infer that `cur` must be less than `p3 - p1` or `p3 - p2`.

Therefore, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` simplifies to:
- If `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2`, then `p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3 = 2*p1`.
- If `p3 - p1 >= p3 - p2`, then `p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - (p3 - p2) + p3 = p1 + p2`.

Since the exact value of `cur` is not specified, we can only express the result in terms of `p1` and `p2` based on the conditions given.

Output: **2*p1 if p3 - p1 < p3 - p2, otherwise p1 + p2**
