Postcondition: **The list `array` is a permutation of length `n`, where `n` is greater than 1. The variables `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is exactly 1, meaning the loop has terminated. The variable `mid` is the index of the element `array[l]` or `array[r]`, which is the last calculated midpoint during the loop's execution. The variable `find` is not directly relevant to the final state since the loop has ended, but it was used to guide the search process within `array`.**
