Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, it does not ensure that the element `x` is placed at the position `l` after performing at most two swaps. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The variables `l` and `r` should be initialized to `1` and `n+1` respectively, as per the problem statement. Additionally, the condition `r - l > 1` should be used to continue the loop.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_1` only checks if `array[l]` is equal to `find`. If not, it performs one swap without considering the optimal placement of `x`. The problem requires placing `x` at position `l` using at most two swaps, which the current implementation does not achieve.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Find the index of x in the array
    x_index = array.index(x)
    
    # Initialize l and r for binary search
    l, r = 1, n + 1
    
    # Perform binary search to find the correct position for x
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= x:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Check if x is already at the correct position
    if l == x_index + 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Determine the necessary swaps
        if l == 1:
            # Swap x with the first element
            print(1)
            print(x_index + 1, 1)
        elif l == n + 1:
            # Swap x with the last element
            print(1)
            print(x_index + 1, n)
        else:
            # Swap x with the first element and then with the correct position
            print(2)
            print(x_index + 1, 1)
            print(1, l)
    
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the element `x` is placed at the correct position `l` using at most two swaps, as required by the problem statement.
