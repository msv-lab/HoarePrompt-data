Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `r - l > 1`.
- After the previous iteration, `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, and `r` is updated based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find`.
  - If `array[mid] <= find`, `r` remains unchanged.
  - Otherwise, `r` is set to `mid`.

### Loop Head Variables:
- The variables in the loop head are `r` and `l`.

### Current State:
- `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `r` is updated based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find`.

### Condition for Next Iteration:
- The loop continues as long as `r - l > 1`.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to continue, `r - l` must still be greater than 1.
- Since `l` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, the only variable that can change is `r`.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `array[mid] <= find`:**
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, `r - l` remains greater than 1 if it was greater than 1 before the update.

2. **If `array[mid] > find`:**
   - `r` is set to `mid`.
   - This means `r` decreases, but since `l` remains unchanged, `r - l` will still be greater than 1 if `r - l` was greater than 1 before the update.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `r - l` must still be greater than 1.
- Since `l` remains unchanged, `r` must be such that `r - l > 1`.

### Final State:
- `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `r` is updated based on the value of `array[mid]` relative to `find`.
- For the loop to continue, `r - l` must be greater than 1.

### Answer:
State: **`mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, and `r` is updated such that `r - l > 1`**.
