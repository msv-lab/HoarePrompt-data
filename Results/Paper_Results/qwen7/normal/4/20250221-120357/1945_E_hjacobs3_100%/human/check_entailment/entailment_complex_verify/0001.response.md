### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the resulting array returns the index of \( x \).
   - The given code attempts to perform a binary search and then determine if a swap is needed to make the element at index \( l \) equal to \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly. It narrows down the range \([l, r)\) until it finds the position where \( p_m \) equals \( x \). However, the implementation of the binary search itself is flawed because it initializes \( r \) to \( n \) instead of \( n+1 \). This means the loop condition \( r - l > 1 \) will never be met for a valid permutation, leading to an infinite loop or incorrect termination.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The logic to find the correct indices for swapping is correct. However, the function should handle the case where \( l \) is already at the correct position (`array[l] == x`) without printing anything.
   - The function prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped even when \( l \) is already at the correct position, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` performs the binary search and checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The logic to find the correct indices for swapping is correct. However, the function should handle the case where `l` is already at the correct position (`array[l] == x`) without printing anything.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `l` is not at the correct position and prints the indices of the elements to be swapped.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `l` is already at the correct position by returning `0` without performing any swaps.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `l` is not at the correct position and prints the indices of the elements to be swapped.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The function outputs the number of swaps required followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped. This matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. The binary search logic is flawed due to the incorrect initialization of \( r \). Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is affected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the binary search logic is flawed, leading to potential infinite loops or incorrect results.
