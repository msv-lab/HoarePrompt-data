Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the resulting array returns the index of `x`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is implemented correctly. It narrows down the range `[l, r)` until it finds the position where `p_m` equals `x`. If `p_l` is not equal to `x`, the function should return the indices of the elements that need to be swapped to make `p_l` equal to `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, we need to find the correct position of `x` in the array. This can be done by finding the index of `x` using `array.index(find)`.
   - **Case 2**: Once we have the index of `x`, we need to ensure that `p_l` becomes `x`. This can be achieved by swapping `array[l]` with `array[array.index(find)]`.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` performs the binary search and checks if `array[l]` is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The logic to find the correct indices for swapping is correct. However, the function should handle the case where `l` is already at the correct position (`array[l] == x`) without printing anything.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `l` is already at the correct position by returning `0` without performing any swaps.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `l` is not at the correct position and prints the indices of the elements to be swapped.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The function outputs the number of swaps required followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped. This matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
