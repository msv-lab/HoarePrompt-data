Output State: **`mid` is now `(l + l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The variable `mid` was initially set to `(l + r) // 2`. After executing the line `l = mid`, the value of `l` is updated to the current value of `mid`. Since `mid` was previously `(l + r) // 2`, updating `l` to `mid` means `l` is now `(l + r) // 2`. The values of `r` and the original formula for `mid` remain unchanged.
