Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` and `n` must be greater than 1; `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`; `array[mid]` is not greater than `find`; `r` is equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `mid`. Since `array[mid]` was initially greater than `find`, after executing the line `r = mid`, `array[mid]` is no longer greater than `find`. The other variables remain unchanged.
