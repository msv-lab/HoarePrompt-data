Output State: **`mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**.

The code updates the value of `mid` to be the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r`. However, the values of `l` and `r` themselves are not altered by this operation. Therefore, they remain as they were in the initial state.
