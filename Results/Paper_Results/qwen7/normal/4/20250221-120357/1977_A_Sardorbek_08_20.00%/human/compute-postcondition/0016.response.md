Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `a` has the same parity as `b`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` has a different parity from `b`, then `a` also remains unchanged.
