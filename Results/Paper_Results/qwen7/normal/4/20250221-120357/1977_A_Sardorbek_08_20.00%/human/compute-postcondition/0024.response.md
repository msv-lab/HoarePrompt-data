Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**

Explanation: The line `q = b, c` creates a tuple `q` that contains the values of `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
