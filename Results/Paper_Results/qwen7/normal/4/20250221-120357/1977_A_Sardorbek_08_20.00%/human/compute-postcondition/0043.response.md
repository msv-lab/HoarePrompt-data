Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is the last integer obtained from the input split, `c` is the last integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all its iterations based on the input value of `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a`, indicating that the loop has run exactly `a` times. The values of `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\) and does not change throughout the loop's execution.
