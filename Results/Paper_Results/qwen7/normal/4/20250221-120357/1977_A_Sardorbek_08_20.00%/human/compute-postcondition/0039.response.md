Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is checked, and if true, no changes are made to `t`. If false, no changes are made to `t` either.**
