Output: **No**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
- `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables before the print statement, the value of the string remains unchanged. Therefore, the output is **'No'**.
