Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes values for t, n, and m where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function likely iterates over a range defined by `t`, processing pairs of `n` and `m` for each iteration, but the specific operations on `n` and `m` are not detailed here.
