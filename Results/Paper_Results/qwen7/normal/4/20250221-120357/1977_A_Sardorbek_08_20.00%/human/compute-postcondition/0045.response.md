Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `a`. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if both `b` and `a` have the same parity (both even or both odd). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
