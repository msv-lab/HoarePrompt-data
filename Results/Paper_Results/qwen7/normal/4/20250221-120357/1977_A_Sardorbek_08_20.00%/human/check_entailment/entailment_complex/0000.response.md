Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` should be `elif b - c == 0:` because we need to check if the difference between `b` (number of moves) and `c` (number of cubes) is zero. This would mean that the number of cubes added and removed are balanced, which is necessary to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

2. **Output Logic**: The current logic for printing 'Yes' when `b` and `c` have the same parity (`a % 2 == b % 2`) is incorrect. This condition checks if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity, but it does not guarantee that the tower ends up with exactly `m` cubes. Instead, it should check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, which would mean that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `m` cubes.

3. **Final Output**: The function does not handle the case where `b` is greater than `c` and the difference is even, which is a valid scenario where Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
