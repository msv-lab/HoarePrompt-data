Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100.
- `a` is an input integer, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `b` is the first integer entered.
- `c` is the second integer entered.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- It is explicitly stated that `b` is not equal to `c`.
- Additionally, it is mentioned that the current value of `b` is less than the current value of `c`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('NO')` directly outputs the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or objects within the print statement itself that need further evaluation. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.
