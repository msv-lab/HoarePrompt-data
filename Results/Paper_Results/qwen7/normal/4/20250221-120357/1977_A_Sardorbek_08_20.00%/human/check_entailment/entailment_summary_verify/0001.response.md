### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The problem involves determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube.
- The key points are:
  - If `n` (number of moves) equals `m` (number of cubes), the answer is "Yes".
  - If `n` is less than `m`, the answer is "No" because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
  - The parity (even or odd nature) of `n` and `m` must match for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `a`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, then prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, and 'Yes' if both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd).

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program
1. **Incorrect Parity Check**: The original program incorrectly uses `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`.
2. **Redundant Variable `q`**: The variable `q` is unused and can be removed.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The program uses 'YES' and 'NO', but the problem specifies 'Yes' and 'No'.

#### Corrected Program
Based on the problem description and the function summary, the correct logic should be:
- If `b` equals `c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b` is less than `c`, print 'NO'.
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity, print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b == c:
            print('Yes')
        elif b < c:
            print('No')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Evaluation
- The original program had a logical error in the parity check.
- The redundant variable `q` was unnecessary.
- The case sensitivity issue was noted but not addressed in the original assessment.

Given these corrections, the original program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues, but the final verdict should reflect the need for the correct parity check.
