Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is an integer.
   - `c` is an integer.
   - `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `a-1`.
   - This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 1 at the start of the first iteration after the previous one.
   - All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be 1.
- All other states (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`) remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**
