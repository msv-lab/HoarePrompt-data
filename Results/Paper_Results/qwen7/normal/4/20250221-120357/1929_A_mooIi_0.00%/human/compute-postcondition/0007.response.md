Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a map object (which is typically a dictionary in Python) containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers `n`.

When the `print(' '.join(ar))` statement is executed, it will join all the keys (which are strings of integers) in the dictionary `ar` with a space character and print the result.

Since the keys in the dictionary `ar` are sorted in ascending order based on the input integer `n`, the output will be a space-separated string of these keys.

Output: **a space-separated string of keys from the dictionary ar, sorted in ascending order based on the input integer n**
