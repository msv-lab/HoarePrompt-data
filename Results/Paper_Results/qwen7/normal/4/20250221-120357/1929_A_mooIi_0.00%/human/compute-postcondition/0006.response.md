Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers**.

Explanation: The code first takes an input of integers separated by spaces, converts them to integers, sorts them in ascending order, and then maps each integer to its corresponding string form. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was just an input integer. The variable `ar` is updated to be a map object containing these string representations of the sorted integers.
