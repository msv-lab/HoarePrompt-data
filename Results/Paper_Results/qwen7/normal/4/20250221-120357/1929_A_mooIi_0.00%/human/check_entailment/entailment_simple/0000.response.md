Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The current implementation simply sorts the array in ascending order and prints it, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the largest possible differences between consecutive elements are achieved. This can be done by sorting the array and then alternating the placement of the smallest and largest remaining elements.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        arr.sort()
        
        # Initialize the result
        beauty = 0
        
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        for i in range(n - 1):
            beauty += abs(arr[i + 1] - arr[i])
        
        print(beauty)
```

Given this analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not maximize the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
