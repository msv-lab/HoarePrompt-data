Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `n` was "an input integer minus 1", but after executing the code, `n` now holds the actual input integer (not minus 1 anymore). The variable `ar` remains unchanged as it was a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order.
