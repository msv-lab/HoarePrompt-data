Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
    print(' '.join(ar))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the new input integer which is less than the original input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of the new integers sorted in ascending order based on the new input integers




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
