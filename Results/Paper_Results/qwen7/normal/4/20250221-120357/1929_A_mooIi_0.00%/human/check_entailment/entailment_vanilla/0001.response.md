### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - For the beauty to be maximized, we should arrange the elements such that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized while minimizing the negative differences.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then converts the list of integers into a map of strings, sorts them, and prints them back out as a space-separated string of sorted integers.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - Sorting the array will not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined.
   - For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. If sorted, it becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty would be calculated as `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`.
   - However, the optimal arrangement could be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]`, giving a beauty of `(90-100) + (80-90) + (54-80) + (43-54) = -10 + -10 + -26 + -11 = -57`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. It simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined.
