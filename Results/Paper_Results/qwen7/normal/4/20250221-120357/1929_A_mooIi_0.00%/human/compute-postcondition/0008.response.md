Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `input()` and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` times. Since the loop is driven by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` determines how many times the loop will run.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After each iteration, the loop counter `_` will increment by 1.
   - The value of `int(input())` will decrease by 1 because it is being used as the upper limit for the range function.
   - The state of `ar` remains unchanged since the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ar`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The number of iterations remaining is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `int(input())` should be `int(input()) - 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers, int(input()) must be less than the original input integer**. 

However, to fit the exact format requested:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers, int(input()) must be less than the original input integer**.
