Output State: The loop will have processed all the test cases provided as input. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers for that specific test case.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have read all the test cases, sorted the integers provided for each test case in ascending order, and printed them out. Each test case's output will reflect the sorted integers for that particular set of inputs.
