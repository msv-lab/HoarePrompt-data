### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we need to strategically rearrange the elements of the array.

2. **Original Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program sorts the array and then joins the elements as strings.
   - The program does not perform any calculation to maximize the beauty of the array.
   - Instead, it simply prints the sorted integers, which does not meet the problem requirements.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the original program, which sorts the integers and prints them.
   - However, it does not mention that the program does not compute the beauty of the array.

4. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected program provided in the original assessment correctly calculates the beauty by sorting the array and then computing the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized, which aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The original program does not solve the problem as intended.
   - The corrected program solves the problem correctly.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array, and the corrected program does solve the problem as required.

### Final:
**False**
