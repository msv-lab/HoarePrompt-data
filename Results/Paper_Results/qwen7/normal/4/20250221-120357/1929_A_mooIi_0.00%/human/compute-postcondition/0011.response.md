Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the new input integer which is less than the original input integer.
- `ar` is a map object containing strings of the new integers sorted in ascending order based on the new input integers.

The `print(' '.join(ar))` statement will join all the strings in the map `ar` with a space as a separator and then print them.

Since `ar` contains strings of the new integers sorted in ascending order, and `n` is the new input integer which is less than the original input integer, the map `ar` will contain strings of these new integers.

Therefore, the output will be the strings of these new integers joined by spaces.

Output: **a space-separated string of the new integers sorted in ascending order**
