Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a map object containing strings of integers sorted in ascending order based on the input integers, `n` is the new input integer which is less than the original input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `int(input())` must be less than the original input integer is already satisfied by the new input, so the original value of `n` (which was an input integer) is now replaced by the new input integer. The map object `ar` remains unchanged.
