Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is (x - coord[2][0]), `res` is math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(x - coord[2][0])**.

Explanation: The line `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. This clears the previous list containing four tuples. Since `coord` is now an empty list, accessing elements like `coord[2]` will raise an IndexError if tried, but we don't need to handle that here. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 is still valid.
