Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t such sets of coordinates, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

    #State: Output State: `i` is 12, `n` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]), `res` is math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be decremented to 0 since it starts as an input integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be 12 because it increments by 4 in each iteration (as there are 4 iterations per loop) and the loop runs 3 times, so \(3 \times 4 = 12\). The value of `x` and `y` remains as input integers from the last iteration, and `coord` contains the coordinates entered in the last iteration. The values of `p2` and `res` are calculated based on the last set of coordinates entered.
