Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing three tuples: (1, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), (x, y)**.

The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples: `(1, an input integer)` and `(an input integer, an input integer)`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains three tuples. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the first two tuples in `coord` remain unchanged.
