Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `4` used in `range(4)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `range(4)` generates values from `0` to `3`, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. Given that `i` starts at `0`, the loop will definitely execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `0` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, and `res`) do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `0`
- `n` must be greater than `0` (unchanged)
- `coord` is an empty list (unchanged)
- `res` is `0` (unchanged)

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, coord is an empty list, res is 0**
