Output State: **`coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `i` is 5, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and second tuple in `coord`, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `res` as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. However, since `p1` is not defined in the given code snippet, it remains undefined. The values of `coord`, `i`, and `p2` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `res` is expressed as the product of the square roots of `p1` (which is undefined) and `p2`.
