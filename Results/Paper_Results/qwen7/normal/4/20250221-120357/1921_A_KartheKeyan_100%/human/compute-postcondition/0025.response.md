Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These values are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 0 and `n` must still be at least 4.
