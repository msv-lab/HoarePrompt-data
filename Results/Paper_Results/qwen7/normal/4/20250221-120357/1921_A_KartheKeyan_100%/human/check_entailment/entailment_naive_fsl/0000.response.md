Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between two points and multiplies these distances to get the area, which is incorrect. For a square, the distance between two adjacent corners should be the side length, and the area is the side length squared. However, the program calculates the distance between diagonally opposite corners, which will give the diagonal length, not the side length. This results in an incorrect area calculation.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
0 0
1 1
0 1
1 0
```

The correct area of the square is 1, but the program will incorrectly calculate the area based on the diagonal length, which is \(\sqrt{2}\), leading to an incorrect result.
