Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each `l` entered, and `l` is an integer entered in the loop.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `s` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` is updated to the input integer, while `s` and `l` retain their previous definitions and values.
