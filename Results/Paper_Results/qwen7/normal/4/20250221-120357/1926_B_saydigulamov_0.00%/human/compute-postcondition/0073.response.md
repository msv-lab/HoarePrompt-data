Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid is guaranteed to contain exactly one triangle or one square with all '1's, and the size of the shape is greater than 1. The function returns whether the shape found is a triangle or a square.**
