Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.**
