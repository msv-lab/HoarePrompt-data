Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is equal (`if k[0] == k[1]:`). This condition is only sufficient for identifying a square when the square is aligned horizontally across the first two rows. However, the problem requires determining whether the entire grid forms a square or a triangle, regardless of their orientation or position within the grid.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The program only checks the first two rows and prints the counts without further processing to determine the overall shape of the grid. For a complete solution, the program needs to check the entire grid and verify if the pattern of '1's matches either a square or a triangle.

3. **No Output for Other Shapes**: The program does not handle cases where the grid forms a triangle. It only prints the counts if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is insufficient for identifying both shapes correctly.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
