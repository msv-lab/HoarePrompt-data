Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1, `k` is an empty list, and `b` and `loop_count` are the last input string and integer respectively.**

Explanation: The line `k = []` initializes `k` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, or `loop_count`. The value of `i` is updated to be the previous value of `i` plus 1, but since the initial value of `i` was not specified, it remains as "equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1". All other variables retain their initial states.
