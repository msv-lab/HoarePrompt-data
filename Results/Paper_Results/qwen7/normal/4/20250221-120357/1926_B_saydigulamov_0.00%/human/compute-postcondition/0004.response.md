Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is an input string**.

The code assigns the value of the input to `b`. Since the input must be a string (as it is read using `input()`), `b` is now a string. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
