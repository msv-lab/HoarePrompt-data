Output State: **Postcondition: `a` is the final input integer (one more than the last input), `b` is the last input string, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in each string `b` that contained the character '1'.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will be the integer input received on the last iteration of the loop, incremented by 1. The variable `b` will hold the string input received on the last iteration. The list `k` will contain the counts of '1's in each string `b` that had at least one '1' in it, collected over all iterations of the loop.
