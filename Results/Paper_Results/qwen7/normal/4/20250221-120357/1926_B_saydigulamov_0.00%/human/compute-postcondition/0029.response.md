Output State: **`a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `b` is an input string containing the character '1'; `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` contains the character '1', `b.count('1')` will return 1. Therefore, `k` will contain the value 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
