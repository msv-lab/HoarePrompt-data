### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, particularly with the logic and the unnecessary function `func_1`. Let's break down the problems and verify the corrected approach.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program:

1. **Unnecessary Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to create a frequency table where the count of each number is clamped to `k`. However, this does not help in determining the minimum number of cards that can be left.
   
2. **Incorrect Logic in the General Case:**
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values but does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left.

#### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Determine the minimum number of unique card numbers.
- For each unique card number, calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left using the formula `ceil(count / k)`.

#### Corrected Program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = sum(math.ceil(count / k) for count in frequency_table.values())
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Frequency Table Calculation:**
   - A frequency table is created to count the occurrences of each card number.

3. **Minimum Cards Calculation:**
   - For each unique card number, the minimum number of cards that can be left is calculated using `math.ceil(count / k)`.
   - The sum of these values gives the total minimum number of cards that can be left.

4. **Output:**
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Evaluation:

The corrected program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly handles the edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues and suggesting a corrected approach.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
