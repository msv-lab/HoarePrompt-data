The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be exactly `k`. Otherwise, the count will be the exact number of times it appears in `arr`.
