Output State: **`frequency_table[num]` is now the count of `num` in the table plus one, `num` is the next element in `arr`, and if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the count of `num` in the `frequency_table`. It does this by retrieving the current count of `num` from the table (or setting it to 0 if `num` is not yet in the table) and then incrementing it by 1. The condition that if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, is already considered in the `get` method because `get` returns the current value if it exists, otherwise 0, and then increments it by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects that `frequency_table[num]` is updated to the new count, while the other conditions remain the same.
