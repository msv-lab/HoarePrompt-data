Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the `frequency_table` will contain the count of each number in `arr` clamped to a maximum value of `k`. Specifically, for every number `num` in `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` will be the minimum of the actual count of `num` in `arr` and `k`.

This means that if a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be exactly `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` will be the exact count of `num` in `arr`.
