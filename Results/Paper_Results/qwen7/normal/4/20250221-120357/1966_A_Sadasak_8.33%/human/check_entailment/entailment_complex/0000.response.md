### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations any number of times. Each operation allows exchanging `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, so the minimum number of cards remains `n`.
   - If `k == n`, only one operation can be performed, reducing the number of cards to `k - 1`.
   - For other cases, we need to consider the frequency of each card. If any card's frequency exceeds `k`, it can be reduced to `k` through operations.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the frequency of each card but ensures that no card's frequency exceeds `k`.
   - The logic correctly clamps the frequency of each card to `k` if it exceeds `k`.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program checks the conditions and calls `func_1` to get the frequency table.
   - If `k` is in the values of the frequency table, it means some cards' frequencies were reduced to `k`, and the minimum number of cards is `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum number of cards is `n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided code handles edge cases like `k > n` and `k == n` correctly.
   - The function `func_1` also correctly processes the frequencies and ensures they do not exceed `k`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations. The function `func_1` accurately clamps the frequencies, and the main program logic is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
