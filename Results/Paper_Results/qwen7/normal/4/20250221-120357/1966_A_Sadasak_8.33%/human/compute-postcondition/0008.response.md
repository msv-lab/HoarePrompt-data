Output State: **`frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, and if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `frequency_table[num]` to the value of `k`. The value of `num` remains the next element in `arr`. Additionally, if `frequency_table[num]` was already greater than `k`, it remains unchanged, but this condition does not affect the current state since `frequency_table[num]` is explicitly set to `k`.
