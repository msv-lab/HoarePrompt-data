Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `arr`. For each iteration, it updates the `frequency_table[num]` based on the condition that if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, it remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `num` changes with each iteration as it goes through each element of `arr`.
   - The list `arr` remains the same throughout the loop.
   - The `frequency_table` is updated based on the condition mentioned, but since we are asked to focus on the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to consider the changes in `frequency_table` yet.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `frequency_table[num]` is now the count of `num` in the table.
- If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.

For the next iteration, the `num` will be the next element in `arr`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `arr`.

**State: **`frequency_table[num]` is now the count of `num` in the table, `num` is the next element in `arr`, and if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.**
