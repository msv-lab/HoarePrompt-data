Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `num` and the iterable `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `num`**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`. Therefore, `num` will take on the values from `arr` one by one.

3. **Initial State of `arr`**: The state before the loop starts is that `arr` is a list of integers. Since the loop will start iterating, the first value of `num` will be the first element of `arr`.

4. **Initial State of `frequency_table`**: The `frequency_table` is initially an empty dictionary. This state does not change based on the loop head, so it remains as is.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is the initial value of `num`, which will be the first element of the list `arr`.

**State:**
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
- `num` is the first element of `arr`.

However, since we cannot specify the exact value of the first element of `arr` without additional information, we can only state that `num` will be the first element of `arr` when the loop starts executing.

**Final State:**
State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**.
