### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, particularly focusing on the logic and the unnecessary function `func_1`. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot even pick `k` cards, you cannot perform any exchanges.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because if you have exactly `k` cards, you can exchange them for `k - 1` new cards.

3. **General Case:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to get the frequency table of card numbers.
   - It checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table. If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` creates a frequency table of the card numbers and ensures that no number appears more than `k` times. However, this function does not directly solve the problem. Instead, it is used to check if any number can be reduced to `k-1` through the allowed operations.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly. The logic should focus on reducing the number of cards to the minimum possible.

2. **Logic for General Case:**
   - The logic in the general case is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values but does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Determine the minimum number of unique card numbers.
- If a card number appears `x` times, the minimum number of cards that can be left is `ceil(x / k)`.

### Corrected Program

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = sum(math.ceil(count / k) for count in frequency_table.values())
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic and the unnecessary function `func_1`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
