Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to limit the frequency of each number to `k`, but it doesn't actually help in determining the minimum number of cards remaining. Instead, we need to focus on how often each number appears and how many operations can be performed to reduce the count of cards.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards Remaining**: The logic in the main part of the program is flawed. It checks if `k > n`, `k == n`, and then calls `func_1` which is unnecessary and misdirected. We need to find the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further by any operation.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each unique number in the list, calculate its frequency.
   - If the frequency of any number is less than `k`, those cards cannot be reduced further.
   - Otherwise, we can reduce the count of cards by performing the operation until the frequency is less than `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = {}

    # Count the frequency of each number
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # If count is less than k, add all such cards to min_cards
        if count < k:
            min_cards += count
        else:
            # Otherwise, add (count % k) to min_cards
            min_cards += count % k

    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that remain after performing the allowed operations.
