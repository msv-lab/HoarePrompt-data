Output State: **`frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `arr`**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `frequency_table[num]` by 1. This means that the count of the occurrence of `num` in the `frequency_table` is increased by 1. The initial condition that `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k` if it is greater than `k` is not directly relevant here since the code simply increments the value by 1. The variable `num` remains as the next element in `arr`.
