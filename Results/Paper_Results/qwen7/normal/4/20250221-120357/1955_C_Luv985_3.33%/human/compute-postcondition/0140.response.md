Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` must be greater than `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
