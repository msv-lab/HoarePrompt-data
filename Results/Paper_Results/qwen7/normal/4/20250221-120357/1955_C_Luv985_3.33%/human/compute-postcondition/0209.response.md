Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.
