Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` must be greater than 5, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. The value of `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, which remains unchanged. The other variables (`T`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation.
