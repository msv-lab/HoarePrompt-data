Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: All instances of `T` will be 0 since the loop continues as long as `T` is truthy (non-zero) and is decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` will hold the value it had after the last iteration of the loop, and `k` will also reflect its final value post-loop, which is guaranteed to be 0 or negative because the loop reduces `k` until it can no longer be reduced. The list `a` will contain the remaining values after all possible reductions have been applied according to the rules described in the loop body. Variable `l` will be equal to `r`, and `r` will be equal to `n - 1`. The variable `ans` will be the total count of elements in `a` that became zero during the loop iterations plus any additional count if `k` was still non-negative and greater than or equal to `a[l]` at the end. The variable `mi` will hold the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation, and `t` will be `k % 2` if the loop broke due to `mi * 2 > k`.
    #
    #Since the loop runs until `T` becomes 0, the final state of the program will have `T` as 0, with all other variables reflecting their final states after the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( T \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the list), an integer \( k \) (initial value), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, the function repeatedly reduces pairs of elements in the list \( a \) by their minimum value, up to \( k \) times, until no further reductions are possible or \( k \) becomes zero. It counts the number of elements in the list that become zero after these operations and prints this count for each test case.
