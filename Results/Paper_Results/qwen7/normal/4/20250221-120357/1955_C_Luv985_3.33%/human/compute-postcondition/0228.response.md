Postcondition: **`a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 1, `ans` is either 2 or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is set to 3. In both cases (whether the condition is true or false), the other variables (`a[2]`, `a[r]`, `k`, `r`, `ans`, `mi`, and `t`) retain their updated values as described in the if part.
