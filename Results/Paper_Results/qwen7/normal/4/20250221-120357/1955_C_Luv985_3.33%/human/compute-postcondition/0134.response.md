Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the variables `l`, `r`, `mi`, `t`, and `ans` retain their initial values because the `break` statement does not modify them. Additionally, the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
