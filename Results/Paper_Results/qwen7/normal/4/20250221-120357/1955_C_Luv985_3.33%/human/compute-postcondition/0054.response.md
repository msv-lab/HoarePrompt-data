Postcondition: **`t` is `k % 2`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced by either `2 * mi` or `0`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 3, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[n - 3]`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If the condition `mi - t - k // 2 == 0` is true, `ans` is set to 3. If the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged at 2.
