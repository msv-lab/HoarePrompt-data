Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is 3, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 2, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
