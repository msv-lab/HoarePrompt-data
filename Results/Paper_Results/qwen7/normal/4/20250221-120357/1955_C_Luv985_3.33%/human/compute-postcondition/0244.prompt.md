Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4; all other variables retain their initial state.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced based on the conditions inside the loop, `k` must be non-negative, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is the total count of elements in `a` that become zero during the loop iterations plus `k >= a[l]`, `a[l]` is either 0 or positive depending on the final value of `k` and the operations performed, and `t` is `k % 2` if the loop breaks due to `mi * 2 > k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After the execution of the if-else block, `T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`, `n` remains an integer from the input, `k` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became zero plus `k >= a[l]`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is not reduced by `2 * mi`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 0, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is the number of operations performed plus 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation, `t` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
