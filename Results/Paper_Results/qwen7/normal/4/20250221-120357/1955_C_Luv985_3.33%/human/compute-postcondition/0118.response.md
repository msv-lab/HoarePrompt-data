Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a[l]` (which is `a[0]` since `l` is 0) and `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]` since `r` is `n - 1`) to the variable `mi`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
