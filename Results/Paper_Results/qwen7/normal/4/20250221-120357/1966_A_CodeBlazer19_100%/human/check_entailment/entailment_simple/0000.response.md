Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations any number of times.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` followed by the list of card values (`l`).
3. It then calculates the count of each unique card value using `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.
4. The logic checks if the maximum count of any card value (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1` because we can always reduce the count of that card type to `k - 1` by exchanging `k` cards. Otherwise, it prints `n` because no further reduction is possible.
5. The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the annotated program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
