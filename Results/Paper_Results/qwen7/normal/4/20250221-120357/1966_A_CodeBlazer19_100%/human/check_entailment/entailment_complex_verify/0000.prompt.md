You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `t` times. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p` will retain their final values determined by the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` and `k` will be the values entered on the last iteration, `l` will be the list of integers entered on the last iteration, and `p` will be a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum count in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program will print `k - 1` during the last iteration; otherwise, it will print `n`.
    #
    #In summary, the output state after all iterations will reflect the state of the variables as they were on the last iteration of the loop, with `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p` updated based on the inputs provided during the last execution of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers n and k, and a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates the count of each unique element in the list and checks if the maximum count is greater than or equal to k. If true, it prints k - 1; otherwise, it prints n. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the maximum count of any card is less than `k` but there are multiple distinct cards present. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
5 2
3 8 1 48 7
```

According to the problem description, since `k = 2`, we can only exchange groups of 2 cards with another group of 1 card. However, the program checks if the maximum count of any card is greater than or equal to `k` and prints `k - 1` if true. In this case, the maximum count is 1, which is less than `k`. Therefore, the program should print `5` because we cannot perform any exchanges and the minimum number of cards left is the total number of cards.

However, the program incorrectly prints `1` in this case. This is because the program does not account for the scenario where no exchanges can be made and the total number of cards remains unchanged. Thus, the program fails to handle this specific case correctly.
