Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers created by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `p` where each element is the count of each unique element in the list `l`. The original values of `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The new variable `p` is created and its elements represent the frequency of each unique number in `l`.
