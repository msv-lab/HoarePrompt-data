Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `i` is 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `p` is a list of counts, where each element is the count of a unique integer in `l`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `p` where each element is the count of a unique integer in the list `l`. The original values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. The new variable `p` is created and its elements are the counts of unique integers in `l`.
