Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second input to `k`. The values of `i`, `l`, `p`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
