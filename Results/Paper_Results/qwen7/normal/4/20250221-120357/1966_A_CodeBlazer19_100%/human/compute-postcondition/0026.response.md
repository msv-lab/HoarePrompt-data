Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list of n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operations based on the provided data and returns results corresponding to each test case.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers, and returns outputs based on these inputs without needing any parameters passed directly to it within its definition.
