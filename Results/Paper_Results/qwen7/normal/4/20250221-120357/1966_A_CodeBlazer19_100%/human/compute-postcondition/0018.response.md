Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer**.

This means that the values of `n` and `k` are now integers obtained from the user input, split by a space and converted to integers using the `map(int, input().split())` function. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
