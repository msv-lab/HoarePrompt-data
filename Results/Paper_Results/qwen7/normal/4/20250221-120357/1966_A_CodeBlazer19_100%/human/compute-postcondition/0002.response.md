Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and `i` is still 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
