Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `i` is 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `l`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 1.
