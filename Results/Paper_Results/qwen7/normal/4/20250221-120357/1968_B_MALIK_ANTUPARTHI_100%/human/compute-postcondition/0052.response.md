Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `b`, `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `k` is equal to `j + 1`**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is equal to `b`, `k` is now updated to `b + 1`. The conditions involving `k` being equal to `c` or `j` being equal to `b - 1` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these conditions directly. Therefore, `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1` still holds true based on the initial state.
