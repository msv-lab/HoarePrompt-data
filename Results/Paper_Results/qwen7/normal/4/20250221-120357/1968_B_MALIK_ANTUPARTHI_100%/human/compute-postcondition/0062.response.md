Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `b` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is equal to `b`.
- `k` is equal to `j`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(b):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(b)`, meaning `j` takes values from 0 to `b-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was equal to `b`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `b`.

2. **Variable `k`:**
   - Initially, `k` is set to `j`.
   - Since `j` was `b` in the previous iteration, `k` is also `b`.

3. **Variable `b`:**
   - `b` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusting the States
- To allow the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `b`.
- `k` will be updated to the new value of `j` in the next iteration.

### New State
- `b` remains greater than 0.
- `j` is decreased by 1 (from `b` to `b-1`).
- `k` will be updated to `j` in the next iteration, so `k` will be `b-1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `b-1`, `k` is `b-1`**
