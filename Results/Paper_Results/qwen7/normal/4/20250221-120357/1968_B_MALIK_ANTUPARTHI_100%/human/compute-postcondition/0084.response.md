Based on the initial state provided:

- `b` is greater than 0.
- `j` is assigned the value of `b`.
- `k` is assigned the value of `b`.

The print statement is `print(k)`. Since `k` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is greater than 0, `k` will also be greater than 0.

Output: **k (where k is greater than 0)**
