Output State: **`b` is a positive integer, `j` is `b + 1`, `k` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The initial state is given as `b` is a positive integer, `j` is `b + 1`, and `k` is `k + e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1`. The code snippet `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Since `j` is already defined as `b + 1`, the new value of `k` becomes `j + 1`, which is `(b + 1) + 1`. The other variables (`b` and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as described.
