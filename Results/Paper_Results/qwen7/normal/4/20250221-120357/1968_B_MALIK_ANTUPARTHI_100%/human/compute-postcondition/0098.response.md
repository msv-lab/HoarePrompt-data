Postcondition: `b` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `b`, `d[j]` is an element in the slice of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, and `j` is now `j + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
