Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is a string input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `j + 1`, and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
