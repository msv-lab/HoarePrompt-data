Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(b)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `b`.
   - `b` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to potentially execute. Since `j` starts at `b`, the loop will not execute if `b` is 0 or negative because `j` will never be less than `b`.
   - Therefore, `b` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` and `j`. Specifically, `b` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), and `j` should be initialized to `b`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` must be a positive integer, `j` is `b`**
