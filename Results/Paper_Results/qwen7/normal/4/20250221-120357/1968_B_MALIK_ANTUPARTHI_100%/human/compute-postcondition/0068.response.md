Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `b-1`, `k` is `b-1`, `k` is now equal to `j`**

Explanation: Initially, `j` is `b-1` and `k` is also `b-1`. After executing `k = j`, the value of `k` is updated to be equal to the current value of `j`, which is `b-1`. Therefore, both `j` and `k` are now equal to `b-1`.
