The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m`, and binary strings `a` and `b`. It calculates and prints the position `k` in string `e` where the substring `d` (derived from `a`) can be found, or indicates if it cannot be found. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.
