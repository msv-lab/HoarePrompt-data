Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`**

Explanation: The code updates the element at the index `left + mid - i - 1` in the array `arr` to the value `small_element + i`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `arr[left + mid - 0 - 1]` which is `arr[left + mid - 1]`. The value of `arr[left + mid - 1]` becomes `small_element + 0`, which is simply `small_element`. Since `i` remains unchanged, its value stays as 0. The value of `mid` is also unchanged and must still be a positive integer.
