The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * `n`. It does not return any value. The function calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) based on `n` and `k`, initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with `n` ones, and fills these arrays using the `make_array` function. Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.
