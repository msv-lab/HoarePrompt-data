Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < not_mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `not_mid` must still be greater than or equal to `mid` (this condition does not change within the loop).
   - The values of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` and `arr[left + mid + i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `not_mid` must still be greater than or equal to `mid`.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will now be `clique` (since `i` is now 1, it refers to `left + mid + 1`).
   - `arr[left + mid + i]` will now be `big_element - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`**
