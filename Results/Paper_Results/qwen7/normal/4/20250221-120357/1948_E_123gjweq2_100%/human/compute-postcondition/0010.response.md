Output State: **`i` is 3, `mid` is a positive integer, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - 3]` is `small_element + 1, `cliquess[left + 3]` is `clique**.

Explanation: The code `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
