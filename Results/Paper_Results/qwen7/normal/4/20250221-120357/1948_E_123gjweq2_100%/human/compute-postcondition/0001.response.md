Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1.**

The code assigns the value of `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `big_element`.
