Output State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, and `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**

Explanation: The code sets the element at the index `left + mid + i` in the array `arr` to the value `big_element - i`. Since `i` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `arr[left + mid + 0] = big_element - 0`, which means `arr[left + mid] = big_element`. The values of `i`, `not_mid`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
