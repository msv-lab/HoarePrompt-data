Output State: **`i` is 2, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`. Initially, `i` is 1, so after the first iteration (which is not shown here), `i` becomes 2. Therefore, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
