Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` with values based on the specified range and clique index.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` is at least 1, `i` is `cliques`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, `arr` is a list of `n` ones, `cliquess` is a list of `n` ones.
    #
    #**Explanation:** After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `cliques`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, and it runs from `0` to `cliques-1`, the final value of `i` will be `cliques`. The loop sets elements in the `arr` and `cliquess` lists based on the value of `i * k` and `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`. Given that the loop runs `cliques` times, every index from `0` to `n-1` in the `arr` and `cliquess` lists will be set to `1`, making both lists a list of `n` ones.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is at least 1)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (where there are n ones in the list)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `mid`, `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `small_element + mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + mid - 2`, ..., `arr[left]` is `small_element + mid - 1`.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `mid`. The array `arr` will have been filled with values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`, starting from index `left + mid - 1` and moving backwards to `left`. The `cliquess` array will have the value `clique` stored from index `left` to `left + mid - 1`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously unchanged states.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `mid`, `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is `big_element - (mid - 1)`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `big_element - (mid - 2)`, ..., `arr[left]` is `big_element - 1`
