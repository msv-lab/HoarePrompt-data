Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. Since `i` is 0, `cliquess[left]` is set to `clique`. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
