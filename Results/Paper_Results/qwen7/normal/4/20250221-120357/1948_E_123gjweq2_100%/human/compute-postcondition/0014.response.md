Output State: The loop runs for `mid` iterations. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `mid`. For each iteration, the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is set to `small_element + i`, and `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.

Specifically, the final state of the array `arr` will have elements from index `left + 1` to `left + mid - 1` filled with values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to indices from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1` in the specified range, and the list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to every index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
