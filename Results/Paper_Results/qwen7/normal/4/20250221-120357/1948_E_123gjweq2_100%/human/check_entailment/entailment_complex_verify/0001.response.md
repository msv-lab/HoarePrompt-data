### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
- It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, with `n` ones.
- It then calls the `make_array` function, but the logic within `make_array` is flawed. The function `make_array` is supposed to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters. However, the current implementation does not correctly distribute the elements into different cliques.

#### Function `make_array`:
- The function `make_array` is intended to fill the array `arr` and `cliquess` with values and corresponding clique numbers.
- The logic inside the function does not correctly distribute the elements into different cliques. Specifically, the indices used in the loops do not match the intended logic. The function should fill the array `arr` with distinct integers from `1` to `n` such that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` holds for all pairs `(i, j)` in the same clique.

#### Main Logic:
- The main logic in `func_1` calls `make_array` with incorrect arguments. It should pass the correct indices and values to ensure that the elements are distributed into valid cliques.
- The assignment of values to `arr` and `cliquess` is not done in a way that ensures all conditions are met (distinct integers, valid cliques).

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- For `n=2` and `k=3`, the expected output is:
  ```
  2 1
  1
  1 1
  ```
  - This is incorrect because the output should be `2 1 1 1` and `1 1` since the only valid clique is `{1, 2}`.

- For `n=5` and `k=4`, the expected output is:
  ```
  3 1 5 2 4
  2
  1 1 2 1 2
  ```
  - This is incorrect because the output should be `3 1 5 2 4` and `2` with the correct clique assignments.

- For `n=8` and `k=16`, the expected output is:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  1
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```
  - This is incorrect because the output should be `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8` and `1` with the correct clique assignments.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to assign values to vertices and form valid cliques. The functions `func_1` and `make_array` need significant corrections to ensure the output meets the problem requirements.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
