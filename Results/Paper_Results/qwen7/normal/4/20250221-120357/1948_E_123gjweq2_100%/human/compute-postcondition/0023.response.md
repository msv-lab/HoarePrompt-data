Output State: **`i` is 4 - `big_element` + `left` + `mid`, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to 4**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `big_element - i` to `arr[left + mid + i]`. Since the initial value of `i` is 4, the new value of `i` after the operation is `4 - big_element + left + mid`. The condition that `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to 4 remains unchanged.
