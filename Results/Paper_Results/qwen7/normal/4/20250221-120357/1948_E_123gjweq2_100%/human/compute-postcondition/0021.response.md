Output State: **`i` is 3, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2`, `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value of `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
