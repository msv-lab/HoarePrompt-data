Output State: **`cliquess[left + mid + i]` is assigned the value `clique`, `i` is 4 - `big_element` + `left` + `mid`, `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to 4.**

This means that the value of `clique` is assigned to the element in the list `cliquess` at the index `left + mid + i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as `4 - big_element + left + mid`. The condition that `not_mid` must be greater than or equal to 4 also remains unchanged.
