Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the condition `x` must be greater than or equal to 1 is preserved.
