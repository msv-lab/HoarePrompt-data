Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `i` is `x`, `x` and `y` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. Since the initial state of `t` and `i` is not affected by this operation, their values remain the same. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers.
