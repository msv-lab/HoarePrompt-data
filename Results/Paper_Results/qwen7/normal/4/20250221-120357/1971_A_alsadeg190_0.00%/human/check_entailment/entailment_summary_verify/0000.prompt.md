You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple pairs of integers from the user input, compares each pair, and prints the larger number followed by the smaller number. The variable `t` is not used within the function and remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. It reads the number of test cases `t` but then processes only one test case inside the loop without resetting variables or reading subsequent inputs. This means the program will only process the first pair of integers and then terminate, failing to process the remaining test cases. For example, if the input is:

```
10
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
2 4
6 9
3 3
0 0
9 9
```

The program will only output:

```
1 9
```

And then stop, failing to process the rest of the test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
