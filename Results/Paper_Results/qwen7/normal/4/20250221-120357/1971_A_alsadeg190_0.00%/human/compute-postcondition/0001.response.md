Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `x` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `x`, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `x` being greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x must be greater than or equal to 1**
