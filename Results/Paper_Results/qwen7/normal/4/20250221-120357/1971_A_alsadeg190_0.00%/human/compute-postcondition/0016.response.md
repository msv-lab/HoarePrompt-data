Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is `x`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code snippet `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `x` and `y`. The variable `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is still equal to `x`, and both `x` and `y` are now input integers.
