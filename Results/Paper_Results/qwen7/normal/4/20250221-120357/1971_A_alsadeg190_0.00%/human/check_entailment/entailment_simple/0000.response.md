Reasoning:

1. The problem requires processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). The goal is to output the minimum and maximum of these two integers for each test case.

2. The annotated program starts by reading the number of test cases, \(t\), which is stored in the variable `x`. It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

3. Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers \(x\) and \(y\) for each test case and stores them in the same variables `x` and `y`.

4. It then checks whether \(x\) is greater than \(y\). If true, it prints \(x\) followed by \(y\); otherwise, it prints \(y\) followed by \(x\).

5. The logic for determining the minimum and maximum values is correct. The code correctly identifies the smaller and larger values of \(x\) and \(y\) and prints them in the required order.

6. The program handles multiple test cases as specified by the value of \(t\).

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
