Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is assigned the value of `x`.
- `x` and `y` are input integers.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

Here, `y` and `x` are explicitly mentioned as input integers. Therefore, the values of `y` and `x` will be printed directly as they are provided as inputs.

Output: **y, x**
