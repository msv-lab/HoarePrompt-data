Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `_` is now 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

After all iterations of the loop, `n` will eventually become 0 because the loop reduces `n` by `m = (n + 1) // 2` in each iteration, and this process continues until `n` is no longer greater than 0. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `L`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
