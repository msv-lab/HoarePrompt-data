Output State: **`k` is decreased by `2 * (tot + a_next)`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 4, `t` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `k`, `n`, `m`, `pow`, and `t` remain unchanged.
