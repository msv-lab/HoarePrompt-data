Output State: **`k` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 1, and `t` is 1; `L` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts the value of `m` (which is 1) from `n`. Initially, `n` is 2. After executing the code, `n` becomes 1. The other variables (`k`, `m`, `pow`, `t`, and `L`) remain unchanged.
