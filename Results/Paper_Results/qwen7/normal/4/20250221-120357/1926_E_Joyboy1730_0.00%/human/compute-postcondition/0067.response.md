Based on the initial state provided:

- `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`.
- `n` is 0.
- `m` is 0.
- `pow` is 1.
- `L` must have at least one element.
- The value of `k` satisfies the condition that `tot < k <= tot + a`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the expression `pow * (2 * k - 1)`:

1. `pow` is explicitly given as 1.
2. `k` is a value such that `tot < k <= tot + a`. Since `k` is within this range, it can take any value from just above `tot` up to `tot + a`.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{pow} \times (2 \times k - 1) = 1 \times (2 \times k - 1) = 2k - 1 \]

Since `k` is greater than `tot` but less than or equal to `tot + a`, the exact value of `k` isn't specified, so we can only describe it in terms of the range.

Output: **2k - 1 (where k is a value such that tot < k <= tot + a)**
