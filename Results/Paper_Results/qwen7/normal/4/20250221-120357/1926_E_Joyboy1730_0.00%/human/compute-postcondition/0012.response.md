Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

This means that the value of `m` has been updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, while all other variables remain in their initial conditions relative to their preconditions.
