Output State: **`k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `k` and the calculation of `tot` and `pow` remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` remains unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, and `n` and `k` are now input integers.
