Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is an index within the range of the list `p`, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and the current value of `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1`.
