Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. Therefore, either the flag has been set to True at some point during the loop's execution (which would happen if there exists an index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`), and the program would have printed 2 and exited the loop, or the flag has remained False after checking all indices, and the program would have printed 3.

In this final state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is equal to `x` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `x`), `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `True` if the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` during the loop's execution, otherwise `flag` is `False`. If the condition was met, the program prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `x` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is equal to `x`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `True`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `x-1`. The loop checks the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` for each `i` in the range `[0, x)`. If the condition is met for any `i`, `flag` is set to `True` and the loop breaks. Since the loop has executed all iterations, if `flag` was never set to `True` during these iterations, it will remain `False`. However, based on the given information, the loop has printed `2` at some point, indicating that the condition was met for at least one `i`, thus `flag` is `True` after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until either the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met for any `i` in the range of `0` to `x-1`, in which case `flag` will be set to `True` and the loop will break, printing `2`. If the loop completes all its iterations without finding such an `i`, it will print `3`.

Given that the loop has already executed three times and the conditions for each iteration are as follows:
- After the first iteration: No specific condition was met.
- After the second iteration: The condition `l[2] == 4` was checked but not met.
- After the third iteration: The condition `l[3] == 5` will be checked.

If `l[3]` does not equal `5`, the loop will continue to the fourth iteration. However, since the problem specifies the loop's behavior after exactly three iterations, we can conclude that the loop did not find an `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` within the first three iterations.

Therefore, the final output state will be determined by whether the condition is met in the remaining iterations. Since the loop has not yet found a match and there are more iterations left, it will continue to check the condition for each subsequent `i` until it either finds a match or completes all iterations.

If no match is found after all iterations, the loop will print `3`. Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: The loop prints `3` if no `i` satisfies `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` after all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
