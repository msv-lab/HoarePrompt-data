Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct.
   - `i` is an index within the range of the list `p`.
   - `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` sets a flag and exits the innermost loop or if statement.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `x`, we need to determine the new value of `i` and ensure that the loop can continue.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value within the range `[0, x-1]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `p` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `l` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is an index such that \(0 \leq i < x\), `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**
