Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where no pair of friends can attend the party together. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, the program should output `3` because Monocarp needs to invite friends 1, 2, and 3 to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. However, the current implementation only checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair exists. Since no such pair exists in this case, the program incorrectly outputs `3` instead of checking all possible combinations of friends to find the minimum number of invitations needed.

To fix this, the program should iterate over all possible pairs of friends and check if inviting those two friends would result in both attending the party. If no such pair exists, then the program should check if inviting three friends is sufficient.
