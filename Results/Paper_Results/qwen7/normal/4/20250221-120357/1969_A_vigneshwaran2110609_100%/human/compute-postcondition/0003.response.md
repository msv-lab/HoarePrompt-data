Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `x` is not used in this line of code, so its state remains unchanged.
