Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `p` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\) and all \(p_i\) are distinct, `i` is equal to `x`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and `flag` is `False`.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. The values of the other variables (`x`, `t`, `n`, `p`, `i`, and `flag`) remain unchanged.
