Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer.**

In this case, the code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
