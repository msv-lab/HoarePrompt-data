Postcondition: `kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or '0' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or 'x' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `vt` is 1; `i` is 2; `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `kq1` and `kq2` will be strings formed based on the comparison of elements at index 0 and 1 of arrays `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` (where `i` is 2) is greater than `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` will include the minimum and maximum of the first two elements of `a` and `b` respectively, along with the minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `kq1` and `kq2` will include the minimum and maximum of the first two elements of `a` and `b` respectively, along with the minimum of the second elements of `a` and `b`, but without the additional value from the comparison of the second elements. The variables `vt`, `i`, `x`, and `y` retain their original values as specified in the precondition.
