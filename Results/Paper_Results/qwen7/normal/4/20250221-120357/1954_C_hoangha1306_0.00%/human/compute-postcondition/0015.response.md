Output State: **`kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))**.

Explanation: The value of `vt` is updated to 1, while the values of `kq1`, `kq2`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
