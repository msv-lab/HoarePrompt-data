Postcondition: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then both `kq1` and `kq2` are concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is concatenated with either `str(int(a[i+1]))` or `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with either `str(y)` or `str(x)`. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is concatenated with the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the value of `x`. All other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `vt`, `q`, `t`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
