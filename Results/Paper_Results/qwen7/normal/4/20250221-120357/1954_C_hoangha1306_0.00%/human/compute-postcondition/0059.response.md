Output State: **`vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` concatenates the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. The values of `vt`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
