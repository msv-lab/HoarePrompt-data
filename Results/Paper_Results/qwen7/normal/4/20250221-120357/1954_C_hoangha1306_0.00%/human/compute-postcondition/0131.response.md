Postcondition: **`kq1` is either "xy" or a string starting with "y" followed by the value of the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, with the current value of `y` added as a string if `a[i] > b[i]`, or with the value of `x` added as a string otherwise. `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `i` is either 4 or 3, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 1.**
