Output State: **`kq1` is a string concatenated with `str(y)`, `kq2` is a string, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1**.

This means that `kq1` now includes the string representation of `y` appended to its current value. The values of `kq2`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, while `y` is updated to be the maximum of the integers obtained from the `i-th` characters of `a` and `b`.
