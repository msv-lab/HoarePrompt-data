Output State: **`kq1` is '0', `kq2` is 'x', `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))**.

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` was initially an empty string, after appending `str(x)`, `kq2` becomes `str(x)`. The values of `kq1`, `vt`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
