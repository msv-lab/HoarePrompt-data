Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, `vt` is 0, `i` is the length of list `a`, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `kq1` is either the string "x" or 'y', `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. Depending on whether `a[i] == b[i]` is true, `kq1` is set to "x" and `kq2` includes the value of `y`, or `kq1` is set to 'y' and `kq2` includes the value of `x`. `vt` is 0, `i` is either 2 or 1, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `kq1` is either "x" or 'y' concatenated with the value of `a[i]` if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it is either "x" or 'y' followed by the value of the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, possibly including `a[i]` if the condition is met, or the original cumulative string plus the value of `x`. `vt` is 0, `i` is either 3 or 2, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `kq1` is either "x" or 'y' concatenated with the value of `a[i]` if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it is either "x" or 'y' followed by the value of the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. `kq2` is a string containing the cumulative string of the larger values from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, possibly including `a[i]` if the condition is met, or the original cumulative string plus the value of `x` if `vt` is 0, or with the value of `y` added as a string if `a[i] > b[i]` and `vt` is 1, or with the value of `x` added as a string otherwise. `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the larger of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `i` is either 4 or 3, `q` is `t - 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `vt` is 0 or 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
