Output State: **`kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with `a[i]`, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1]) and `int(b[i+1])`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect any variable values or the conditions given. Therefore, the values of `kq1`, `kq2`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `vt`, `q`, `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
