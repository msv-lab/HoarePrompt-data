Postcondition: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. 

If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq2` is the string representation of `x` without its last character, and `i` is incremented. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.
