Postcondition: **`kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or '0' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or 'x' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `vt` is 1; `i` is 2; `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` if `vt` equals 0. Otherwise, `kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or '0' plus `y`; `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or 'x' plus `x`; `vt` is 1; `i` is 2; `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`; `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`.**
