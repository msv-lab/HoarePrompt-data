Functionality: **The function processes multiple pairs of strings representing integers of the same length (digits from 1 to 9). For each pair, it constructs two new strings: `kq1` and `kq2`. `kq1` contains the smaller digit from each pair of corresponding elements in the original strings, while `kq2` contains the larger digit. If any pair of corresponding elements are not equal, `vt` is set to 1. After processing all pairs, it prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each pair.**
