Postcondition: `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\), `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 2, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is incremented by \(2^{cur_ss}\). Otherwise, the values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.
