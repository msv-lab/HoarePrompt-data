Output State: **`i` is \(k-1\), `t` must be greater than \(k-1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from input, `s` is the string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the string input by the user to the variable `s`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
