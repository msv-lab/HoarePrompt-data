The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and a string \( s \). It checks if the string \( s \) contains a pattern of length \( k \) at least \( n \) times. If the pattern appears at least \( n \) times, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string based on the pattern's occurrences and the remaining required characters.
