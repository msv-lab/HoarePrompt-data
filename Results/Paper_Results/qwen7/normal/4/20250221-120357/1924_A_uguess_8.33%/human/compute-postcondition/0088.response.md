Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` remains unchanged as it is set to `(1 << k) - 1`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the character `ss` converted from its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a'**.

This means that the variable `cur_ss` has been assigned the value of the ASCII code of `ss` minus the ASCII code of 'a', while `s`, `ss`, and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial states.
