Postcondition: `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 1, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cur` remains unchanged; otherwise, `cur` is updated to the original value of `cur` plus 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`.
