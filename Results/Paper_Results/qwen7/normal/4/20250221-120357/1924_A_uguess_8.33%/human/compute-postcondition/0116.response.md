Output State: **`i` is `2k-1`, `cur` is an integer where none of the bits from position `0` to `k-1` are set (i.e., `cur` is `0`), `tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is `0`, `ans` is an empty string, and `ans` is concatenated with `tmp`.**

In this case, the code `ans += tmp` concatenates the current value of `tmp` to the end of `ans`. Since `tmp` is initially an empty string, concatenating it to `ans` does not change the value of `ans`. Therefore, `ans` remains an empty string. All other variables (`i`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
