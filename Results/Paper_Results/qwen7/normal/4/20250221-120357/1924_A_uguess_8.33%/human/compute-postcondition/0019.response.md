Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is the current value of `cnt`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `ss` is the next element in `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `cur_ss` as the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'. This value is then assigned to `cur_ss`. The values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `ss` remain unchanged from their initial states.
