Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `ss` is the first character of the string `s`, the current value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` bits. Since `cur & 1 << cur_ss` was originally `0`, after adding `1 << cur_ss` to `cur`, the least significant bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` will now be `1`, making the result of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` equal to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
