Postcondition: `ss` is the second character of `s`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`. If the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` remains unchanged and all other variables retain their values as specified in the if part.
