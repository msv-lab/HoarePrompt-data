Postcondition: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. The current value of `cur` is 0 and the condition `(cur & 1 << i == 0)` is true.**
