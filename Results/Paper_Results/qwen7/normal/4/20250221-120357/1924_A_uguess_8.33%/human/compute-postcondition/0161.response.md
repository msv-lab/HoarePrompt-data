Output State: **`ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tmp = ''` simply assigns an empty string to the variable `tmp`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `ss`, `cnt`, `i`, `cur`, `ans`, and the initial state of `tmp` remain unchanged.
