Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `i` is `2k-1`. This means `i` is an odd number.
   - `cur` is an integer where none of the bits from position `0` to `k-1` are set. This implies that the binary representation of `cur` has all bits from position `0` to `k-1` as `0`.
   - `tmp` is an empty string.
   - `cnt` is `0`.
   - `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)`, which means `ans` is a string consisting of `(n - 1)` characters, all of which are `'a'`.

2. **The print statement:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is a string of `(n - 1)` characters, all of which are `'a'`. Therefore, when the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print this string.

Output: **'a' * (n - 1)**
