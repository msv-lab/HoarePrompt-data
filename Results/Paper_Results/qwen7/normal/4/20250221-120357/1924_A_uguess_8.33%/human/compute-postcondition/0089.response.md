Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1 + 1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the character `ss` converted from its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a'**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`, where `cur_ss` is the integer value of the character `ss` converted from its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged.
