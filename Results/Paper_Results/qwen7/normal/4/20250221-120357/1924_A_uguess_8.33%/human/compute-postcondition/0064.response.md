Output State: **`i` is \(k-1\), `t` must be greater than \(k-1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from input, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of `cnt` being set to 0.
