Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `k` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` and `itest` remain unchanged from their initial state.
