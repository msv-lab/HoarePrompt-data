Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.
