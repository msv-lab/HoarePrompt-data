Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them by spaces, assigning them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` depend on the user's input, but they are guaranteed to satisfy one of the given conditions: either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, or `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.
