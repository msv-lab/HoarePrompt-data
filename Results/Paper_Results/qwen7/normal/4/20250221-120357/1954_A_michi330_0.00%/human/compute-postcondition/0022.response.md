Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, itest equals the total number of iterations (which is the value of t), n, m, and k are integers obtained from the last input split by spaces. The condition checked in the loop is n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k. If the condition was met for any iteration, 'Yes' was printed; otherwise, 'NO' was printed.**

In this final state, `t` will be the same as the initial input since it controls the number of iterations. `itest` will be equal to `t` because after all iterations, `itest` will have incremented to the total count of iterations. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be those provided in the last set of inputs, as these are updated with each iteration but reset for the next input. The output will reflect whether the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k` was met for any of the inputs processed during the loop's execution.
