Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `itest` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer entered.
- `m` is the second integer entered.
- `k` is the third integer entered.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since the string `'Yes'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, or `k`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **Yes**
