Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `itest` remains 0 (though this variable does not affect the print statement).
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, and the conditions `n > k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k` hold true.

The print statement is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will simply print the string 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
