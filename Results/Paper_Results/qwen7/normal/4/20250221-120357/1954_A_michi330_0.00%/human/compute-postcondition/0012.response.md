Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `itest` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces. However, their specific values are not provided in the initial state.
- The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO' without depending on the values of `n`, `m`, or `k`.

Since the print statement is fixed and does not change based on the values of other variables, the output will always be 'NO'.
