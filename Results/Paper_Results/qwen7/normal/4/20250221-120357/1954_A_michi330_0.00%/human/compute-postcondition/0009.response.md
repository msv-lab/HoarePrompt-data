Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` remains 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, and either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, or `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.
