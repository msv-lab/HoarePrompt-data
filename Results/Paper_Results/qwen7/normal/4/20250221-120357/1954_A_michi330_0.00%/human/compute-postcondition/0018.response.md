Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `itest` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are the first, second, and third integers entered, respectively.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output: **'NO'**
