The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
- `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.
- `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater.
- If `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
- Alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must still be non-empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `max_heap` is not empty.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater, if `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1**.
