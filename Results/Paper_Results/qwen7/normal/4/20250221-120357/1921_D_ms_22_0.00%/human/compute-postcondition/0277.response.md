Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is the second element of the `item` tuple) and `b[tp1]`. This value is stored in the variable `diff1`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
