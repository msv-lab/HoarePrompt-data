Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `a`; `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; either `max_heap` contains a tuple with values `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or `max_heap` contains a tuple with values `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.
