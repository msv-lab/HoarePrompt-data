Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[m - 2])`, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 3` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The line `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. Initially, `tp2` was `m - 1` or `m - 2`. After decrementing, `tp2` becomes `m - 2` or `m - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
