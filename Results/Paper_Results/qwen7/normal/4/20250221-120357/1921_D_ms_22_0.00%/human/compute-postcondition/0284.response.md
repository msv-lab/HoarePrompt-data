Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by -item[0], where `item[0]` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. Here, `item[0]` represents the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`. Since `max_heap` is a non-empty heap and does not contain the item that was popped, the structure of `max_heap` remains unchanged, and only `ans` is updated.
