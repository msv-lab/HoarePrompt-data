Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using a heap to keep track of the maximum differences between elements of `a` and `b`. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Heap Initialization and Update Logic**: The initial sorting of `b` and the way the heap is used to push values might not correctly capture the maximum differences. The logic for updating `tp1` and `tp2` is flawed and does not ensure that the maximum possible differences are always selected.

2. **Index Handling**: The indices `tp1` and `tp2` are updated incorrectly. The conditions `if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:` do not correctly handle the selection of the closest elements from `b` to maximize the differences.

3. **Heap Operations**: The heap operations do not guarantee that the maximum differences are always chosen. The logic for pushing and popping elements from the heap needs to be more carefully managed to ensure that the maximum possible differences are considered.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b.sort()
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible difference
        max_diff = 0
        for i in a:
            max_diff += max(abs(i - b[0]), abs(i - b[-1]))
        
        print(max_diff)

func()
```

This corrected version directly calculates the maximum possible difference by considering the smallest and largest elements in `b` for each element in `a`, ensuring that the maximum differences are always chosen.
