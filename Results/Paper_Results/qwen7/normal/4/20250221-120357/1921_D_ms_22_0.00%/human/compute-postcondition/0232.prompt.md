Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tp1` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`. After the execution of the if-else block, `max_heap` will either contain a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` holds true, or a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. After the execution of the if-else block, either a new variable `max_heap` is created containing one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is pushed into a max heap named `max_heap` if `diff1 <= diff2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`. After executing the if-else block, either a max heap contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or a new max heap contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
