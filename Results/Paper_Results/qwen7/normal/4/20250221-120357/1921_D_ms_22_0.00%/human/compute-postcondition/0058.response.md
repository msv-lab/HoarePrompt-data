Output State: **`tp2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `ans` is still increased by `-item[0]`, `max_heap` still does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is still the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[2]` is still between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and `item[2]` is still not equal to `tp1`.
