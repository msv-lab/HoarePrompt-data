Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on `t`. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. The values of `n` and `m` are set to the integers entered by the user.
