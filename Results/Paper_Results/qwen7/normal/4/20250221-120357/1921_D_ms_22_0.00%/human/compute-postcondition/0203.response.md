Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are still input integers, `a` is still a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and `b` is now a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
