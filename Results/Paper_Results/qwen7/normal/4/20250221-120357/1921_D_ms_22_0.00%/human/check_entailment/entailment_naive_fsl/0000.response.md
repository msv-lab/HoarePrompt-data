Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the smallest and largest elements in `b` are not used optimally to maximize the total difference `D`.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 8 2 10
```

Expected Output:
```
23
```

However, the program outputs `11`. The correct approach would be to pair each element in `a` with either the smallest or the largest element in `b` to maximize the differences. Hereâ€™s how the correct solution should work:

1. Sort both arrays `a` and `b`.
2. Pair the smallest element in `a` with the largest element in `b`, the second smallest element in `a` with the second largest element in `b`, and so on.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import math
    import heapq

    def func():
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
            a = list(map(int, input().split()))
            b = list(map(int, input().split()))

            # Sort both arrays
            a.sort()
            b.sort()

            ans = 0
            for i in range(n):
                # Calculate the maximum possible difference
                diff1 = abs(a[i] - b[m - 1 - i])
                diff2 = abs(a[i] - b[i])
                ans += max(diff1, diff2)

            print(ans)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the differences are maximized by pairing each element in `a` with the most different element in `b` available.
