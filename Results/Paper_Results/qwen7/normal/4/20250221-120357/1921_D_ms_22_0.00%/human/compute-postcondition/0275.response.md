To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `max_heap`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is non-empty.

Let's break down the states and identify which ones need to be adjusted:

1. **`a` is an empty list**: This state does not affect the loop condition since the loop checks `max_heap` directly.
2. **`i` is not defined**: This state does not affect the loop condition.
3. **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple**: For the loop to continue, `max_heap` must still contain at least one tuple. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is non-empty.
4. **`tp1` is either `tp1 + 1` or `0`, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]` or `ans - item[0]`, and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`: These states are part of the loop body and do not affect the loop condition directly. They will be updated inside the loop based on the operations performed within the loop.
5. **If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` is either `tp1 + 1` or `0`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, where `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`: This conditional logic updates `tp1` and `ans` but does not affect the loop condition.
6. **Otherwise, if `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1**: This conditional logic updates `tp1` and `tp2` but does not affect the loop condition.

Given that the loop continues as long as `max_heap` is non-empty, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `max_heap` is non-empty.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`max_heap` is non-empty**
