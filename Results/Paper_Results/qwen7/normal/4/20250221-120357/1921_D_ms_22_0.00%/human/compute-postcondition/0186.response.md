Postcondition: `max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the greater of `diff1` and `diff2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` is greater, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by -1 if neither condition for incrementing `tp1` nor decrementing `tp2` is met.
