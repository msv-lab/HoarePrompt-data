Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1, and the value of `ans` remains as it was increased by `-item[0]` in the initial state. The precondition that `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped remains unchanged.
