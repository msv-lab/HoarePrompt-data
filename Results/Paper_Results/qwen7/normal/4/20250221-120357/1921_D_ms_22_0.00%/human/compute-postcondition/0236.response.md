Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` remains `0`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` remains `0`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff1` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` (an element popped from `max_heap`) and `b[tp1]` (where `tp1` is `0`). The other variables remain unchanged.
