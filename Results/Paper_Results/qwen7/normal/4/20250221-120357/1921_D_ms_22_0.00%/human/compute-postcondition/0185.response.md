Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by `diff2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff2` adds the value of `diff2` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `tp2` is decremented by 1, the updated state includes these changes.
