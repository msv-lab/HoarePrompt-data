Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`, `max_heap` contains a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` and the condition `diff1 > diff2` still holds true.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. The values of `a`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The `max_heap` now contains the specified tuple, and the condition `diff1 > diff2` is preserved.
