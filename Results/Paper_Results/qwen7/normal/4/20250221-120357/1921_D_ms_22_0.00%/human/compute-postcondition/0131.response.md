Output State: **`i` is the next value in the list `a` (let's call it `i_next_next`), `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i_next_next` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the updated absolute difference between `i - b[m - 1]`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-abs(i_next_next - b[0]), i_next_next, 0)` if `abs(i_next_next - b[0]) > abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1])` or the tuple `(-abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1]), i_next_next, m - 1)` if `abs(i_next_next - b[0]) <= abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1])`, and the new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` has been pushed into `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` into the `max_heap`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `b[0]`, `diff1`, or the existing elements in `max_heap`. The value of `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`. The state of `max_heap` is updated to include the new tuple along with the existing one(s) based on the comparison condition.
