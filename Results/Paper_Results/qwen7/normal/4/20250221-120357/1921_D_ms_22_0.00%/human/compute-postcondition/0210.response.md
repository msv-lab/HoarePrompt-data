Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` (`i`) and the last element of list `b` (`b[m-1]`), storing the result in `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
