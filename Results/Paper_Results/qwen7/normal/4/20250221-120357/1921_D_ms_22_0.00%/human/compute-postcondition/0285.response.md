Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1, while `max_heap` and `ans` retain their previous states. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `-item[0]`, which means `ans` is increased by the negation of the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.
