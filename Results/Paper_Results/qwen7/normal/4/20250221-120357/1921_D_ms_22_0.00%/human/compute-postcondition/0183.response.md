Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff1` increases the value of `ans` by the value of `diff1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
