Postcondition: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is either `tp1 + 1` or `0`, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]` or `ans - item[0]` (which means `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]` in both cases), and `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` is either `tp1 + 1` or `0`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, where `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`. Otherwise, if `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
