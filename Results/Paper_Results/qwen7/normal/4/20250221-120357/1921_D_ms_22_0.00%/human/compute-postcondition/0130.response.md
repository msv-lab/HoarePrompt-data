Output State: **`i` is the next value in the list `a` (let's call it `i_next_next`), `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i_next_next` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i - b[m - 1]`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i_next_next, 0)` pushed into it.**

Explanation: The code pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. Here, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i_next_next` and `b[0]`. Since `i` is `i_next_next` in the initial state, `diff1` remains the same. The tuple `-diff1, i_next_next, 0` is added to `max_heap`, which means the heap now contains this new element. The other variables (`b[0]`, `diff2`, and the structure of `max_heap` before this operation) remain unchanged.
