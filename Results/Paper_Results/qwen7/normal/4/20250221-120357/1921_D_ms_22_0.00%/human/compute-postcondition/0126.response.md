Postcondition: `i` is `i_next`, `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`, `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2` or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.
