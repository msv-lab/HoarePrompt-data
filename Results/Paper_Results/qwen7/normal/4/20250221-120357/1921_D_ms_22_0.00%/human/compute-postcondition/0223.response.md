Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, a tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) is pushed into a max heap named `max_heap`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple containing `-diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1` into a max heap. Since `m` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as `m - 1`. The values of `a`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged.
