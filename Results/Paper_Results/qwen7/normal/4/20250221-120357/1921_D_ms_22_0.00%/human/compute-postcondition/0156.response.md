Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`; `ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp2` is decreased by 1; `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`**.

The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
