Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the second input split by space sorted in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list called `max_heap`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
