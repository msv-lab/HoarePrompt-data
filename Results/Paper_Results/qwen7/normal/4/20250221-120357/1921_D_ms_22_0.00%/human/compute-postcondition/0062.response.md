Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on whether `item[2]` is closer to `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is increased by 1 and `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is further increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`.
