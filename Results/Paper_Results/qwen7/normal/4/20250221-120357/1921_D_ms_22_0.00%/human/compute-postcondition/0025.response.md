Output State: **`i` is the second element of `a`; `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; a max heap named `max_heap` has been updated with the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a max heap called `max_heap`. The values of `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The heap operation does not affect these variables but creates a new structure (`max_heap`) with the specified tuple.
