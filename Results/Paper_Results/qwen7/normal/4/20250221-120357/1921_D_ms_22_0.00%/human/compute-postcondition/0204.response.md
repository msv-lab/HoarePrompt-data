Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `max_heap`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
