Output State: **`max_heap` will be empty, `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described, and `t` is equal to `t - 1`.**

This means that the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables (`max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
