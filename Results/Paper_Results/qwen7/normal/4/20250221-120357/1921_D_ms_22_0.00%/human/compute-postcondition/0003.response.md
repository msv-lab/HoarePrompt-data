Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\)**

Explanation: The initial state of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The code `t -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `t`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer between 1 and 100, after subtracting 1, `t` will now be a positive integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive).
