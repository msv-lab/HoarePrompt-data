Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. The variable `item` is described as the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed, so `item[0]` represents the highest value in `max_heap`. After executing the code, `ans` is increased by the negative of this highest value. The `max_heap` itself does not change; it simply no longer contains the item that was popped.
