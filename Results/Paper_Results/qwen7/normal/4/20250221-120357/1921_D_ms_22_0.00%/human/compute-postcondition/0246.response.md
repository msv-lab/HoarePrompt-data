Postcondition: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[m - 1])` or `abs(item[1] - b[tp2 - 1]) + ans`, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` is either `1` or `0`, `tp2` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans + diff2`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**
