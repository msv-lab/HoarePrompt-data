Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `i` (which is the second element of `a`) and the last element of `b` (denoted as `b[m - 1]`). The values of `a`, `i`, and `diff1` remain unchanged.
