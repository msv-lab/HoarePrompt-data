Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding the values of `diff1` and `diff2` are preserved.
