Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` or `diff2` is chosen accordingly, and either `tp1` is incremented by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.
