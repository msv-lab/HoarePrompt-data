Output State: **`i` is the next value in the list `a` (let's call it `i_next_next`), `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i_next_next` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i - b[m - 1]`, `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-abs(i_next_next - b[0]), i_next_next, 0)` if `abs(i_next_next - b[0]) > abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1])` or the tuple `(-abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1]), i_next_next, m - 1)` if `abs(i_next_next - b[0]) <= abs(i_next_next - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `diff2` to be the absolute difference between `i` (which is `i_next_next`) and `b[m - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
