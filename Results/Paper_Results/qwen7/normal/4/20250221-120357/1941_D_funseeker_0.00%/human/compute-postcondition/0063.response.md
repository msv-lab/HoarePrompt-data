Output State: **`m` is decremented by 1, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, and `ans` has not yet been updated for this iteration; a new empty set named `temp` is created.**

Explanation: The code creates a new empty set named `temp`. The values of `m`, `r`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
