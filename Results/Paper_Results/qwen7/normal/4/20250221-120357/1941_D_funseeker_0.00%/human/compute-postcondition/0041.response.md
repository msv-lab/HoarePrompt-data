Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained `(q + r) % n`, after executing this line, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
