n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. For each throw, r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and c is a string representing the direction of the throw ('0', '1', or '?').
