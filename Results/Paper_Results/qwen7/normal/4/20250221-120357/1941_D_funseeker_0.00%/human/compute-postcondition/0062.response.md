Output State: **`m` is decremented by 1, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, and `ans` has not yet been updated for this iteration.**

The code snippet `r = int(r)` converts the value of `r` to an integer. Since `r` was initially the integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, converting it to an integer does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `r` remains the same as the integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`. The other variables (`m`, `c`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
