Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in ans:`. This means the loop iterates over each element `q` in the set `ans`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the set `ans` must contain at least one element. If `ans` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **List the relevant states**:
   - `m` is decremented by 1.
   - `r` is the integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`.
   - `c` remains the same as its initial value.
   - `ans` has not yet been updated for this iteration.
   - A new empty set named `temp` is created.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop depends on the set `ans` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `ans` is not empty.
   - The other variables (`m`, `r`, `c`, `temp`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ans` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element**
