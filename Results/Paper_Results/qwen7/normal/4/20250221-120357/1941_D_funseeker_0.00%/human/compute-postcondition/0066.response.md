Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `c` is equal to '0' or '?', `temp` contains (q + r) % n.**

Explanation: The code adds an element `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The initial state of `ans` containing at least one element and `c` being '0' or '?' remains unchanged. The variable `temp` now includes the new element `(q + r) % n`.
