Postcondition: `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` contains the added value `(q - r) % n`, regardless of whether `c` is '1' or '?' since there is no else part that changes these conditions.
