### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. It is used to read the necessary inputs for subsequent functions.
   
2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it processes the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and the list of throws. It calls `func_1()` to get the required inputs.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function reads the inputs for a single test case (i.e., `n`, `m`, `x`) and returns them as a list of integers. It is called within `func_4()` to initialize the necessary variables.

4. **Function `func_4()`**: This function processes each test case. It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction specified ('0', '1', or '?'). After processing all throws, it adjusts the set `ans` to ensure it does not contain `0` and adds `n` if `0` was removed. Finally, it prints the length of the set and the elements in the set.

### Analysis:

- **Initialization**: The function correctly initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`.
- **Throw Processing**: The function correctly updates the set `ans` based on the direction of each throw. If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), both possible positions are added to the set.
- **Final Adjustments**: The function correctly removes `0` from the set if it is present and adds `n` to the set if `0` was removed.
- **Output**: The function correctly prints the length of the set and the elements in the set.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, the function `func_4()` correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
