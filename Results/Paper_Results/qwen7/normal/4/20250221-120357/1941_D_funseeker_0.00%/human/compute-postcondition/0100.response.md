Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` contains all possible unique `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` values for all initial elements in `ans` after `m` iterations.
- `c` is either '1' or '?'.
- `m` is 0.
- `ans` does not contain the value `0`.

Given that `m` is 0, no iterations have been performed, meaning the values in `ans` remain the same as the initial values. Since `ans` does not contain the value `0`, it implies that the initial values of `ans` are already unique and do not include `0`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(*ans)` will simply print the elements of `ans` as they are, without any changes due to the iterations.

Output: **the elements of ans (as they are initially, without containing 0)**
