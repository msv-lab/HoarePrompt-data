Output State: **`ans` contains at least one fewer element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`, `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `ans` contains at least one fewer element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', and `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`, the updated state includes these changes.
