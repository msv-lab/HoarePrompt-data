Output State: **`r` is an integer value converted from the first element returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`**.

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the first element returned by `func_1().split()` (which was initially stored in `r`) into an integer. The second element returned by `func_1().split()` remains unchanged and is still stored in `c`.
