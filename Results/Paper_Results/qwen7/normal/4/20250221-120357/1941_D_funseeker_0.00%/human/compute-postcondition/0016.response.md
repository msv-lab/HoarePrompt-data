Postcondition: **`c` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. `q` changes to the next element in `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged with elements where each element is `(q + r) % n`.**
