Output State: **Postcondition: `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the last element in `ans`, and `temp` contains the set of elements where each element is `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `c` retains its initial value (either '1' or '?'), `q` becomes the last element in the list `ans`, and `temp` accumulates all the values of `(q - r) % n` for each iteration where `c` is '1' or '?'. Since the loop processes each element in `ans` exactly once, `temp` will contain the result of `(q - r) % n` for the final `q` value.
