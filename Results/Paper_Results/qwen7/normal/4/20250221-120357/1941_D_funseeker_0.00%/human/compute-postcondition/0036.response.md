Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` contains (q + r) % n.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp`. This element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Here, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`. The variable `c` remains unchanged as it was initially either '0' or '?'. The set `temp` now includes the computed value `(q + r) % n`.
