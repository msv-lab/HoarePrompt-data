Based on the initial state provided:

- The value of `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
- `n` is also equal to the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is either -1 or the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]` (if such an index exists), but `x` is not equal to -1.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the steps:

1. Since `i` and `n` both represent the length of the string `s`, they are equal.
2. `x` is defined as the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, but it is specified that `x` is not equal to -1. This means there is at least one character in the string `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
3. The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. This implies that the substring starting from the character at index `x + 1` does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and the result of `func_1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
