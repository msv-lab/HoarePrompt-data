### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It correctly returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `1`, and `s`, which is the correct behavior.
     - If `s` is a palindrome, it proceeds to find a non-palindromic substring.
   - It iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
     - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character and breaks out of the loop.
     - If no such character is found, `x` remains `-1`.
   - After the loop:
     - If `x` is still `-1`, it means all characters in `s` are the same, so it prints "NO".
     - If `x` is not `-1`, it further checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is not a palindrome.
       - If `s[x+1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
       - If `s[x+1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is `1` or half the length of `s`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two substrings `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic correctly handles the cases where the entire string is a palindrome and where it can be split into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The conditions and outputs match the problem statement requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions.

**Correctness: **True**
