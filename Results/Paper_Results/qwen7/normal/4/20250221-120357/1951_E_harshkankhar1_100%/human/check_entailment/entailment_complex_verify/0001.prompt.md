You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters. It then checks if the string is composed entirely of the same character. If not, it finds the first character that differs from the first character of the string. Based on this, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO', along with additional information. The function returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It works correctly by comparing the string with its reverse.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
     - If `s` is a palindrome, it tries to find a split point `x` where the substring starting from index `x+1` is not a palindrome.
       - It iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character.
       - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it means the string is uniform and thus cannot be split into non-palindromic parts, so it prints "NO".
       - If a split point `x` is found, it further checks if the substring from `x+1` onwards is not a palindrome.
         - If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
         - If the split point `x` is at the beginning or middle of the string in a way that prevents a valid split, it prints "NO".
         - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.

### Testing the Functionality

#### Test Case 1: `sinktheyacht`
- The string is not a palindrome.
- The function should output:
  ```
  YES
  1
  sinktheyacht
  ```

#### Test Case 2: `lllllllll`
- The string is a palindrome.
- The function should output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

#### Test Case 3: `uwuowouwu`
- The string can be split into `uw`, `uow`, and `ouwu`.
- The function should output:
  ```
  YES
  3
  uw uow ouwu
  ```

### Verification

Let's verify the function with these test cases:

```python
# Test Case 1
s = "sinktheyacht"
func_2()  # Should output: YES, 1, sinktheyacht

# Test Case 2
s = "lllllllll"
func_2()  # Should output: NO

# Test Case 3
s = "uwuowouwu"
func_2()  # Should output: YES, 3, uw uow ouwu
```

### Conclusion

The function `func_2` correctly handles the test cases as described. It identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the appropriate results.
