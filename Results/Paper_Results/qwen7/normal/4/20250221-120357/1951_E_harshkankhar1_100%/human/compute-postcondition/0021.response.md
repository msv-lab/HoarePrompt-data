Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `i` is 3, and the code assigns this value to `x`. The length of the input string `s` (denoted as `n`) remains unchanged, but since no operations were performed on `n`, its value is still the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, `i` and `x` both have the value 3.
