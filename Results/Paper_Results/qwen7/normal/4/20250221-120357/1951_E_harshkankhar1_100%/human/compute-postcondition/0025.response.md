Output State: **The value of `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is either -1 or the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]` (if such an index exists).**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` from 1 up to `n-1`. If at any point `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, the loop breaks and sets `x` to `i` and exits. If the loop completes without finding any character that is not equal to `s[0]`, `x` will remain -1. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n-1` and then stops.
