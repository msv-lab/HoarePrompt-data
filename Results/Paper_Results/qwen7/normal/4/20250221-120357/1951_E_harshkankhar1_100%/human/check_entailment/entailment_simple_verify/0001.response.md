### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
- It works correctly by comparing the string with its reverse.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
- **Initial Analysis**:
  - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
  - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it tries to find a split point `x` where the substring starting from index `x+1` is not a palindrome.
    - It iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character.
    - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it means the string is uniform and thus cannot be split into non-palindromic parts, so it prints "NO".
    - If a split point `x` is found, it further checks if the substring from `x+1` onwards is not a palindrome.
      - If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
      - If the split point `x` is at the beginning or middle of the string in a way that prevents a valid split, it prints "NO".
      - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.

#### Detailed Verification

1. **Test Case 1: `sinktheyacht`**
   - The string is not a palindrome.
   - The function should output:
     ```
     YES
     1
     sinktheyacht
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     - `func_1("sinktheyacht")` returns `False`.
     - The function prints "YES" and the string itself, which is correct.

2. **Test Case 2: `lllllllll`**
   - The string is a palindrome.
   - The function should output:
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     - `func_1("lllllllll")` returns `True`.
     - The function prints "NO", which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3: `uwuowouwu`**
   - The string can be split into `uw`, `uow`, and `ouwu`.
   - The function should output:
     ```
     YES
     3
     uw uow ouwu
     ```
   - **Verification**:
     - The function finds `x = 2` because `s[2] != s[0]`.
     - It then checks `func_1("uowouwu")` which returns `False`.
     - The function prints "YES" and the partitions `uw` and `uow ouwu`, which is correct.

#### Annotated Code Analysis

- **Line-by-Line Verification**:
  - The function correctly handles the cases where the string is a palindrome or not.
  - The logic for finding the split point `x` and checking the subsequent substring is sound.
  - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the appropriate results for the given test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
