Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`.
- `n` is also equal to the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is either -1 or the index where `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]` (if such an index exists), but `x` is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True.
- The condition `(x == 1 or x == n // 2)` is false.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(2)` will simply print the number 2.

Output: **2**
