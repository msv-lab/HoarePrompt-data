Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the entire string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input string `llllllll`. This string is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" and suggests a partition, which is not valid.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. It works correctly.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If the entire string is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition, which is correct.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it enters the loop and tries to find a non-matching character. Since all characters are the same, it will always fail to find a non-matching character and incorrectly print "NO".
   - If a non-matching character is found, it attempts to partition the string, but it does not handle the case where the entire string is a palindrome correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly handle the case where the entire string is a palindrome, the program should check if the entire string is a palindrome and print "NO" if it is, without attempting to partition it.

### Suggested Fix:
Modify the program as follows:

```python
def func_2():
    s = input().strip()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

This fix ensures that the program correctly handles the case where the entire string is a palindrome.
