The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of a permutation, an integer `k` such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation. It performs a binary search to find the position of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints 0. If `k` is not found, it prints 1 followed by the index where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order and the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` (or -1 if not found). The function returns nothing.
