Postcondition: **The final state of the loop will have `low` equal to `high` or `low + 1` equal to `high`, indicating the search range has been narrowed down as much as possible. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop. The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.**
