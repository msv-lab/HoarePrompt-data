Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the postcondition is that `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, which is `n-1` (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration up to `n-1`). The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The variable `pos` will be set to the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` exists in `arr`, otherwise it will remain `-1`.

In simpler terms, `n` will be at least as large as the last index checked by the loop, `i` will be the last index checked (`n-1`), and `pos` will either be the index where `k` was found in `arr` or will still be `-1` if `k` was not found.
