Output State: **`low` is updated to `mid` if `arr[mid]` <= `k`, otherwise it is set to 0; `high` is set to `mid` if `arr[mid]` <= `k`, otherwise it is set to `mid`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `st` is a set containing the value of (`low` + (`high` - 1)) // 2, and `st` now includes the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The code adds `mid` to the set `st`. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` are updated as per the conditions given in the initial state. The set `st` now contains the value of `mid`.
