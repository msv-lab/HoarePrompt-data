Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `st` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `high` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `low`, `high`, and `mid` are updated such that if `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid` and `high` remains greater than 1. The value of `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` and `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `low` is updated to `mid` if `arr[mid]` > `k`, otherwise it is set to 0; `high` is set to `mid` if `arr[mid]` > `k`, otherwise it is set to `mid`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `st` is a set containing the value of (`low` + (`high` - 1)) // 2, and `st` now includes the value of `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
