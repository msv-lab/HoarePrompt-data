Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(0 + (high - 1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2**.

Explanation: Initially, `mid` is calculated as `(0 + (high - 1)) // 2`. After executing `mid = (low + high) // 2`, the value of `mid` is updated to this new expression. The other variables (`low`, `high`, and `st`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
