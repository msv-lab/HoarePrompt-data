Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an integer.**

This means the function `func_3` takes in a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` within the range from 1 to `n`, and a list `arr` containing `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Based on these inputs, the function returns an integer value.
