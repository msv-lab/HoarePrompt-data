Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` should start from 0.

4. **Consider other given variables**:
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), but this does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, but its value is not relevant to the loop's execution.
   - `pos` is -1, which also does not affect the loop's execution.

Based on the above analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
