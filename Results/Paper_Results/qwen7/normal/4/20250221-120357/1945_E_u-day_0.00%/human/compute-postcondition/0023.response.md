Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `mid` is `(0 + (n-1)) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. The set `st` is initialized with the value of `mid`.
