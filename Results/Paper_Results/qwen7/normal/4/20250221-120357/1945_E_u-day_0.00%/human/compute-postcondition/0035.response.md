Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables (`low`, `mid`, and `st`) retain their previous values as per the initial state. Specifically, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` remains unchanged as it was previously defined as a set containing the value of `(low + (high - 1)) // 2`.
