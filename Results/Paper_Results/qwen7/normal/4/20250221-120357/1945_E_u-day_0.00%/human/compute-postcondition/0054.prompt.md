You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the postcondition is that `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, which is `n-1` (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration up to `n-1`). The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The variable `pos` will be set to the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` exists in `arr`, otherwise it will remain `-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `n` will be at least as large as the last index checked by the loop, `i` will be the last index checked (`n-1`), and `pos` will either be the index where `k` was found in `arr` or will still be `-1` if `k` was not found.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: The final state of the loop will have `low` equal to `high` or `low + 1` equal to `high`, indicating the search range has been narrowed down as much as possible. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, low + 1
    #State: The final state of the loop will have `low` equal to `high` or `low + 1` equal to `high`, indicating the search range has been narrowed down as much as possible. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop. Additionally, `arr[low]` will be equal to `k` if the condition `arr[low] == k` is met in the if part, and not equal to `k` if the else part is executed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an integer.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
