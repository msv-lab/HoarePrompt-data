The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
