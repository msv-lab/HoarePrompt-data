Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input from the next iteration.
- `k` is the second integer input from the previous iteration.
- If `k` equals 1, we continue the loop. If `k` does not equal 1, no change is made to the variables.

The print statement is `print(k // 2 + 1)`. 

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the value of `k`:

- If `k` equals 1, the loop continues, and the value of `k` remains 1. Therefore, `k // 2 + 1` would be \(1 // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\).
- If `k` does not equal 1, the value of `k` remains unchanged, and the expression `k // 2 + 1` will depend on the actual value of `k`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `k` other than it being the second integer input from the previous iteration and the condition that if `k` equals 1, the loop continues, we must consider the general case where `k` could be any integer except 1.

However, since the problem asks us to determine the output based on the given information and the precondition, and considering the loop continuation condition, the most precise and general answer we can provide is based on the value of `k` when it is 1.

Output: **1**
