Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cells to color in an \(n \times n\) grid such that at least \(k\) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
2. The solution provided handles different cases based on the value of \(k\):
   - If \(k == 1\), the minimum number of cells to color is 1.
   - If \(k \leq 2n\), the minimum number of cells to color is \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\).
   - Otherwise, the minimum number of cells to color is \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\).

3. Let's verify each condition:
   - When \(k == 1\), the solution correctly prints 1.
   - When \(k \leq 2n\), the solution correctly calculates \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\) using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - When \(k > 2n\), the solution correctly calculates \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\).

4. The logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. The function processes each test case correctly and outputs the expected results.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
