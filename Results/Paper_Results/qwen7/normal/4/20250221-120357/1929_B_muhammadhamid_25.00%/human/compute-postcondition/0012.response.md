Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1.
- \(k > 2 \times n\).

Given the print statement:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

We need to determine the value of `k // 2 + 1`.

From the precondition, we know:
- `k` is initially set to 1.
- \(k > 2 \times n\).

Since `k` must be greater than \(2 \times n\) and `k` is initially set to 1, it implies that `k` must be updated to a value greater than \(2 \times n\). However, the exact value of `k` is not specified beyond this condition. Therefore, the minimum value `k` can take is \(2 \times n + 1\).

Let's assume the minimum value for `k` to be \(2 \times n + 1\):

\[ k = 2 \times n + 1 \]

Now, we calculate `k // 2 + 1`:

\[ k // 2 + 1 = (2 \times n + 1) // 2 + 1 \]
\[ = n + \frac{1}{2} + 1 \]
\[ = n + 1.5 \]

Since `k // 2` performs integer division, the result of `(2 \times n + 1) // 2` is `n + 0` (integer division truncates the decimal part), so:

\[ k // 2 + 1 = n + 1 \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `n + 1`.

Output: **n + 1**
