Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1, and the next input is an integer, `n` is an integer input, `k` is updated to the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them from a single input string, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is split into two integers, `k` is updated to the second integer input, which was initially set to 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
