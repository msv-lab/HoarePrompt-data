The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. The states of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string and its current value is 1.**
