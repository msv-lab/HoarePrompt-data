Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `1`. This is correct because even a single cell can satisfy the condition if `k == 1`.

3. **Case where \( k \leq 2n \)**:
   - The program uses `math.ceil(k / 2)` to calculate the number of cells needed.
   - This logic is based on the observation that each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction).

4. **Case where \( k > 2n \)**:
   - The program uses `k // 2 + 1` to calculate the number of cells needed.
   - This logic is based on the observation that after covering all 2n diagonals, additional cells are needed to cover the remaining diagonals.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with some examples:

- **Example 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k = 4 \leq 2 \times 3 = 6 \):
    - Number of cells needed: \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - This matches the expected output of 2.

- **Example 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k = 3 \leq 2 \times 3 = 6 \):
    - Number of cells needed: \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - This matches the expected output of 2.

- **Example 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k = 10 > 2 \times 3 = 6 \):
    - Number of cells needed: \( 10 // 2 + 1 = 6 \)
  - This matches the expected output of 6.

- **Example 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( k = 9 > 2 \times 3 = 6 \):
    - Number of cells needed: \( 9 // 2 + 1 = 5 \)
  - This matches the expected output of 5.

- **Example 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \)
  - Since \( k = 7 \leq 2 \times 4 = 8 \):
    - Number of cells needed: \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \)
  - This matches the expected output of 4.

- **Example 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 7 - 2 = 26 \)
  - Since \( k = 11 \leq 2 \times 7 = 14 \):
    - Number of cells needed: \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \)
  - This matches the expected output of 6.

- **Example 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 2 - 2 = 6 \)
  - Since \( k = 3 \leq 2 \times 2 = 4 \):
    - Number of cells needed: \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - This matches the expected output of 2.
