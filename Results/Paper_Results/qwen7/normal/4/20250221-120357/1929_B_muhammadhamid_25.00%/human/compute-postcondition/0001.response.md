Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string and `k` is the second integer input split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The first integer is assigned to `n` and the second integer is assigned to `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
