Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2 + a[2] * 2`; `x` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i] * 2`, which is `a[2] * 2`. The initial decrease was by `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2`, so the total decrease is now `a[0] * 2 + a[2] * 2 + a[2] * 2`. The condition that `x` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
