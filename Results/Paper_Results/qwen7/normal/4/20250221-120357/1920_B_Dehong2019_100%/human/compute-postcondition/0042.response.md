Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`. Since `i` is now 1, `x` must be greater than 1.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `ans1` remains unchanged from the previous state (decreased by `a[0] * 2`).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**
