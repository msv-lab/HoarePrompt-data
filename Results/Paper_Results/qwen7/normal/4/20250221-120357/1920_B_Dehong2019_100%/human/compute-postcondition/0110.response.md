Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It then sorts the list in descending order and calculates two values, \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \). \( ans1 \) is initially set to the sum of the sorted list. It subtracts twice the first \( x \) elements from \( ans1 \). Next, it iterates \( k \) times, each time adjusting \( ans1 \) by adding the current element and subtracting twice the element at position \( i + x \) (if within bounds). \( ans2 \) keeps track of the maximum value of \( ans1 \) during these iterations. Finally, it prints \( ans2 \) for each test case.**
