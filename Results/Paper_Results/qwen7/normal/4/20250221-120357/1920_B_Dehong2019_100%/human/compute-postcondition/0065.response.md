Output State: **`ans1` is the maximum of `ans2` and `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] - 2 * a[i]`, `i` is `x + 2`, `k` must be greater than `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value. Since `ans1` was previously defined as the maximum of `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] + a[i]` and `ans2`, the new value of `ans1` is now `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x] - 2 * a[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged.
