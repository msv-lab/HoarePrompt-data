Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[i]`**.

The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` decreases the value of `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i]`. Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `a[i]`, we express the change in terms of `a[i]`. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
