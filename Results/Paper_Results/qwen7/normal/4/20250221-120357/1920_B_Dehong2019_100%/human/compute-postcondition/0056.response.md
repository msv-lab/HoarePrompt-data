Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is less than or equal to 0, `k` must be greater than `x`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates `ans2` to be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. This does not change the values of `ans1`, `i`, `x`, `k`, or `a[i]`. The condition `i + x < n` is not met since `x` is less than or equal to 0, so `ans1` is not further decreased. Therefore, the values of `ans1`, `i`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `ans2` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `ans1`.
