Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is crucial because we want to maximize the sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum (`ans1`):**
   - The initial sum of the array (`ans1`) is calculated using the sorted array.
   - This step is correct because it sets up the initial state before any removals or negations.

4. **Negating Elements by Bob:**
   - The program iterates through the top `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice their value from `ans1`. This simulates Bob negating these elements.
   - This step is correct because it accounts for Bob's optimal strategy to minimize the sum.

5. **Removing Elements by Alice:**
   - The program iterates through the top `k` elements of the sorted array and adds them to `ans1`.
   - If `i + x < n`, it also subtracts twice the value of the corresponding element from the end of the array. This accounts for the interaction between Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
   - This step is correct because it simulates Alice's optimal strategy to maximize the sum.

6. **Finding the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum sum (`ans2`) after considering the effects of both Alice and Bob's moves.
   - This step is correct because it ensures that the final result is the best possible sum under the given constraints.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. The program handles the sorting, the removals, and the negations as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
