Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 2 * a[i + x] + a[i]` if `i + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[i] + a[i]` if `i + x >= n`, and `ans2` is equal to `max(ans1, ans2)`**.

Explanation: The line `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` is updated to include `a[3]`. The conditions for `ans1` remain the same, just adding `a[3]` to the respective expressions. The value of `k` and the relationship between `ans1` and `ans2` also remain unchanged.
