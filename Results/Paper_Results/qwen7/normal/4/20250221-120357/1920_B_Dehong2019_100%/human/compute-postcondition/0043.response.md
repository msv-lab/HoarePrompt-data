Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[i] * 2`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 1 and `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`. After executing `ans1 -= a[i] * 2`, since `i` is 1, `ans1` is further decreased by `a[1] * 2`. Therefore, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
