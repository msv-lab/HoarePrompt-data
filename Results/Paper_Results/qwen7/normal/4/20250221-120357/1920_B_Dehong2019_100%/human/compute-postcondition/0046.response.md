Output State: `i` is equal to `x`; `ans1` is decreased by the sum of every element in list `a` multiplied by 2; `x` is less than or equal to 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `x-1`. Therefore, `i` will reach `x` at the end. `ans1` will be reduced by `2 * a[i]` for each iteration of the loop, so it will be decreased by `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `x`, and given that `x` is the final value of `i`, `x` must be less than or equal to 0 for the loop to terminate, as per the initial conditions provided.
