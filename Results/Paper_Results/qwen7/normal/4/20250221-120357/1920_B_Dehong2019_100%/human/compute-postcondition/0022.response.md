Output State: **`k` must be less than or equal to 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` before the operation.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `a[i]` will be either `a[0]` or `a[1]`. However, without knowing the exact value of `i` and `x`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans1`. The conditions for `ans1` and `ans2` remain the same as the initial state, just with the modification that `ans1` has been updated.
