Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans1` is either `a[0] - 2 * a[x] - 2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, or `a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[i]` if `i + x >= n`, and `ans2` is equal to `max(ans1, ans2)`**.

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates `ans2` to be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition for `ans1` and the relationship between `ans2` and `ans1` are preserved.
