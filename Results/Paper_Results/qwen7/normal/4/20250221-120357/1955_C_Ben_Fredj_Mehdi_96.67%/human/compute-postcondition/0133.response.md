Output State: **`k` must be greater than 2, `d` is decreased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, if `a[d]` was initially equal to 0, then `g` is increased by 1, `g` is now `g + 1`, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 1`, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 1`**

Explanation:
- `k` must be greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `d` is decreased by 1 (unchanged except for the operation).
- `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1` (unchanged except for the operation).
- If `a[d]` was initially equal to 0, then `g` is increased by 1 (unchanged except for the operation).
- `g` is now `g + 1` (unchanged except for the operation).
- `a[g]` is decreased by 1 (unchanged except for the operation).
- `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 1` (unchanged except for the operation).

The code `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` does not introduce any new information but confirms that `a[g]` is already an integer and is decreased by 1 again, which is consistent with the previous operations.
