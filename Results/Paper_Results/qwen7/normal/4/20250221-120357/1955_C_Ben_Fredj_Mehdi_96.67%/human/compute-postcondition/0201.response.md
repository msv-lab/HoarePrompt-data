Output State: **`a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[d]` by decrementing its current integer value by 1. Similarly, the value of `a[g]` is also updated by decrementing its current integer value by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
