Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, and `k` is the second element of `a`. If `k` is 10000000000000, `k` is set to 10000000000000 and `n` is not equal to 101. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged based on specific conditions: if `k` is 99999999999999, it remains 99999999999999. If `k` is 199999999999999 or 1000000000000, it remains unchanged. If `n` is 2 and `k` is 2147483648, no changes are made. If `n` is 2 and `k` is 1000000000 and `a` is exactly `[1000000000, 1000000000]`, no changes are made. If `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, no changes are made. If `n` is not 2 and `k` is not 2147483648, and `n` is not 5, and `k` does not equal 99999999999999, 1000000000, 199999999999999, 100000000000, 200000000000, 5999999999, and `k` is not less than the sum of all elements in `a`, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, each element in `a` is decremented by half of `k`, `g` is incremented by 1, and if any element in `a` becomes 0, the corresponding index `d` is decremented by 1. If `k % 2 == 1`, `d` is further decremented by 1.**
