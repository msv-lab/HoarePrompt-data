Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers split from the input string.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- `k` is not equal to 99999999999999.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- `k` is not equal to 1000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 199999999999999.
- `k` is not equal to 100000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 200000000000.
- `k` is not equal to 2147483648.
- `n` is not equal to 101.
- Either `n` is not equal to 5 or `k` is not equal to 2147483648.
- `(n != 20 or k != 10000000000)`.

The key piece of information here is the print statement itself:
```python
print('5')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'5'`.

Output: **5**
