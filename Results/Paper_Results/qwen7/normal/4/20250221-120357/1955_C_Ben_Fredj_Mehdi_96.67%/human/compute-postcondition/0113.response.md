Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[d]` is decreased by 1; `a[g]` is equal to 0; `g` is increased by 1.**

The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. Since the initial state of `g` was such that `a[g]` is equal to 0, after incrementing `g` by 1, `g` itself is increased by 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
