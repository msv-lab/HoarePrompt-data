Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[d]` is decreased by 1**

Explanation: The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` decreases the value of `a[d]` by 1. Since `a[d]` was previously decreased by 1 (though the exact value is not specified), it is now further decreased by 1. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
