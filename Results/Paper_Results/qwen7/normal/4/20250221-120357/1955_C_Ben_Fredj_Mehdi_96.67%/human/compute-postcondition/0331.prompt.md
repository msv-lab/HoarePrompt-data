Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with the last element decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and if the current value of `a[d]` is 0, then `a[d]` remains 0. Otherwise, the value of `a[d]` does not change. The state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with the second last element decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 4, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 2, `g` is 2, `a[g]` (which is the second last element) is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with the second last element decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 5, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 3, `g` is 3, the second last element of `a` is decremented by 1, `a[d]` is decremented by 1, and if an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the nearest loop or conditional block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
