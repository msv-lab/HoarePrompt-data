Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with the last element decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and the current value of `a[g]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. Initially, `g` was 0 (since the last element of `a` was decremented, and `g` was used to access the last element). After incrementing, `g` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
