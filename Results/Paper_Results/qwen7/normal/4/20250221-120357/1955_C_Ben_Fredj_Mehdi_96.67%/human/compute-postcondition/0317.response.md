Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with the second last element decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 4, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 2, `g` is 2, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.**

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if part does not change any of the variables' values and there is no else part to consider.
