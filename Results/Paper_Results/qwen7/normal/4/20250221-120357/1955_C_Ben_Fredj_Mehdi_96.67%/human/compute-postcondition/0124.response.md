Output State: **`k` must be greater than 2 since i+1 < k//2, `a[d]` is decreased by 1, `a[d]` is now `a[d] - 1`, if `a[d]` was initially equal to 0, then `g` is increased by 1, `g` is now `g + 1`, `a[g]` is decreased by 1, `a[g]` is now `a[g] - 1`**.

This means that `a[d]` has been decreased by 1, and if `a[d]` was initially 0, then `g` has been increased by 1 and `a[g]` has also been decreased by 1. The condition that `k` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
