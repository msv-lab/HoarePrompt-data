Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced to an input integer, and no other variables are defined or changed.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, and `k` is the second element of `a`. If `k` is 1999999998, `k` remains 1999999998. Otherwise, if `k` is 1999999999, `k` remains 1999999999. If `k` is 99999999999, `k` remains 99999999999. If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, `k` remains 10000000000000. If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 101, `k` remains 10000000000000 and `n` remains 101. If `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 2, no changes are made. If `k` is 1000000000 and `a` is exactly `[1000000000, 1000000000]`, no changes are made. If `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 5, no changes are made. If `k` is not 2147483648, `n` is not 5, and `k` is not 99999999999999, 1000000000, 199999999999999, 100000000000, 200000000000, 5999999999, and `k` is not less than the sum of all elements in `a`, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, each element in `a` is decremented by half of `k`, `g` is incremented by 1, and if any element in `a` becomes 0, the corresponding index `d` is decremented by 1. If `k % 2 == 1`, `d` is further decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting right after the first space. If `k` equals 1999999998, no changes occur. If `k` equals 1999999999, no changes occur. If `k` equals 99999999999, no changes occur. If `k` equals 99999999999999, `a` is updated according to specific decrement rules. Otherwise, if `n` is 1 and `k` is 10000000000000, `a` is updated to a list of integers. For other values of `k`, if `k` does not equal 3000000000, `i` will be equal to `k // 2`, `a[d]` will be decremented by the total number of iterations, and `g` will be incremented each time `a[g]` is decremented to 0. If `a[d]` reaches 0 during any iteration, `d` will be decremented accordingly. The condition `k % 2 == 1` remains true throughout the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `k` equals 1999999998, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` equals 1999999999, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `k` equals 99999999999, `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. If `n` equals 1 and `k` equals 10000000000000 and the first element of `a` is 1, then `k` is updated to be the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the character right after the first space. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
