Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[g]` is decreased by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[g]` by subtracting 1 from its current integer value. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Other variables and their conditions are not affected by this operation.
