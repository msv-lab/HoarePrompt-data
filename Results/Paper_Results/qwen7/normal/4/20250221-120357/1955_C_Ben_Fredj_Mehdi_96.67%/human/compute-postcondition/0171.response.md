Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, and `k` is the second element of `a`. If `k` is 1999999998, `k` remains 1999999998. Otherwise, if `k` is 1999999999, `k` remains 1999999999. If `k` is 99999999999, `k` remains 99999999999. If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 1, `k` remains 10000000000000. If `k` is 10000000000000 and `n` is 101, `k` remains 10000000000000 and `n` remains 101. If `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 2, no changes are made. If `k` is 1000000000 and `a` is exactly `[1000000000, 1000000000]`, no changes are made. If `k` is 2147483648 and `n` is 5, no changes are made. If `k` is not 2147483648, `n` is not 5, and `k` is not 99999999999999, 1000000000, 199999999999999, 100000000000, 200000000000, 5999999999, and `k` is not less than the sum of all elements in `a`, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, each element in `a` is decremented by half of `k`, `g` is incremented by 1, and if any element in `a` becomes 0, the corresponding index `d` is decremented by 1. If `k % 2 == 1`, `d` is further decremented by 1.**
