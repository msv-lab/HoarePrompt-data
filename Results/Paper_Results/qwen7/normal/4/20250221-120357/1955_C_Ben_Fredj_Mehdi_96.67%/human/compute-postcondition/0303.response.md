Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with the last element decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring in `a` starting from the beginning up to the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and if the current value of `a[g]` is 0, then `a[g]` remains 0. Otherwise, the value of `a[g]` does not change.
