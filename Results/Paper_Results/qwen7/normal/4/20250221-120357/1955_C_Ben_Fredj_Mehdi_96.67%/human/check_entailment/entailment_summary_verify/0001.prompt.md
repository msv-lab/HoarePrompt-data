You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers representing the durability of the ships. Based on the value of \( k \), the function either prints a specific integer directly or modifies the list \( a \) by decrementing its elements. Finally, it prints the count of zero-valued elements in the list \( a \) after all modifications.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the durability of the ships.
   
2. **Special Cases**:
   - The program includes several special cases where it directly prints a fixed value without performing any logic. These cases are based on specific values of `n` and `k`. However, these special cases do not cover all possible scenarios, especially when `k` is large and `n` is small.

3. **General Case Logic**:
   - For general cases, the program uses a loop to simulate the attacks on the ships.
   - It alternates between attacking the first and the last ship until `k` attacks are performed.
   - It handles the scenario where a ship's durability reaches zero by adjusting the indices `g` and `d` accordingly.
   - Finally, it counts the number of ships that have sunk (i.e., their durability is zero).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not correctly simulate the attacks when `k` is very large and the number of ships (`n`) is small.
   - The special cases are hardcoded and do not account for the general behavior of the Kraken's attacks.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1**: `n=4`, `k=5`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - The program should correctly simulate the attacks and count the sunk ships.
  - The output should be `2`.

- **Example 2**: `n=4`, `k=6`, `a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - The program should simulate one more attack and correctly count the sunk ships.
  - The output should be `3`.

- **Example 3**: `n=5`, `k=20`, `a=[2, 7, 1, 8, 2]`
  - The program should simulate 20 attacks and correctly count the sunk ships.
  - The output should be `5`.

### Special Case Analysis:
- The special cases in the program are hardcoded and do not cover all possible scenarios. For example, the case where `k` is `1999999998` or `1999999999` is handled incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly, especially when `k` is very large and the number of ships (`n`) is small. The special cases are not comprehensive and may lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
