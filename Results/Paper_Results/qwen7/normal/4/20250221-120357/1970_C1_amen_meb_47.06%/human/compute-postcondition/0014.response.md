Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the second element of the list `nums`, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `nums` is a list containing the strings split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `num1 = int(nums[0])` assigns the integer value of the first element of the list `nums` to the variable `num1`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `num2`, and the state of `nums`) remain unchanged.
