Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `nums` is assigned the value of `numbers`, and if the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
