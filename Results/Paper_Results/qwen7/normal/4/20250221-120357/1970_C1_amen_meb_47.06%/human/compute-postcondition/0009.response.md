Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the second element of the list `nums`, `nums` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`.**

The code appends a list containing the first two elements of the list `nums` to the `numbers` list. Since `num1` is the first element of `nums` and `num2` is the second element of `nums`, the `numbers` list now contains `[num1, num2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
