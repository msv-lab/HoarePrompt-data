Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`, and `num2` is assigned the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`.**

In this case, the code updates `num2` to the integer value of the second element in the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
