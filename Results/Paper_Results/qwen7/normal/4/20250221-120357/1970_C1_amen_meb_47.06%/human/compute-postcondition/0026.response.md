Output State: **The program returns a list named 'numbers' which contains every pair of integers [num1, num2] provided as input during the loop's execution, with each element in the list being a pair of integers where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. The variables t, u, and v remain as 1, and the last pair of integers entered are stored in num1 and num2.**

This means that the program collects all pairs of integers provided as input and stores them in the list `numbers`. The variables `t`, `u`, and `v` do not change from their initial values, and `n` remains within its specified range. The last pair of integers entered are stored in `num1` and `num2`.
