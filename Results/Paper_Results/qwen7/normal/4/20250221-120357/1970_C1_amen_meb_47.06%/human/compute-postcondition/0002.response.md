Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `nums` is assigned the value of `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `nums`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `numbers`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
