Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the second element of the list `nums`, `nums` is a list containing the strings split from the input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `num1`, `num2`, or `nums`. It only indicates that the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was inside.
