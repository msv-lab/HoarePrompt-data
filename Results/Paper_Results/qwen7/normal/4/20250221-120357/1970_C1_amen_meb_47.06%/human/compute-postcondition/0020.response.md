Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `num1` is the integer value of the first element of the list `nums`, `num2` is the integer value of the second element of the list `nums`, and the list `numbers` contains one element which is `[num1, num2]; nums` is a list obtained from input split by spaces, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
