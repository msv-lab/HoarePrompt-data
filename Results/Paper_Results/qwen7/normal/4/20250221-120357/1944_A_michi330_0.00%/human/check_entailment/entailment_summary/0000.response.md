Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most \( k \) bridges.
- The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k \geq n - 1 \), which means all bridges except those connecting to island 1 can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable. In this case, the program prints 1.
- For the general case where \( k < n - 1 \), the program incorrectly assumes that Everule can visit \( n - 1 \) islands. However, the optimal strategy for Dominater would be to destroy bridges in such a way that isolates as many islands as possible while still allowing Everule to reach some islands. The program does not account for this optimal strategy.
- The program fails to consider scenarios where destroying fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges can still isolate more than one island, making the solution incorrect in many cases.

Correctness: **False**

The program's logic is flawed because it does not implement the optimal strategy for Dominater to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit. It only considers the extreme case where \( k \geq n - 1 \) and incorrectly assumes \( n - 1 \) islands are reachable in other cases.
