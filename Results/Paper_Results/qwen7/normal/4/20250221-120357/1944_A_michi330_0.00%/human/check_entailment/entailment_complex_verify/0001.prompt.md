You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, i is 3, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the first iteration's input. The values of t, i, n, and k remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition k >= n - 1 is true or false for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints \( n - 1 \). The function reads these test cases from standard input and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - Initially, there are \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) bridges connecting all pairs of islands.
   - Everule starts from island 1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
     - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n - 1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \( k \geq n - 1 \)**
     - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands.
     - Therefore, Everule can only visit island 1, which matches the output of `1`.
   - **Case 2: \( k < n - 1 \)**
     - If \( k < n - 1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely.
     - In this case, Everule can still visit all other islands except those directly connected to island 1 by the destroyed bridges.
     - However, the program incorrectly prints `n - 1`, which means it assumes Everule can visit all islands except island 1.
     - This is incorrect because Everule can still visit some of the islands indirectly through other connections.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:** \( n = 2 \), \( k = 0 \)
     - Output should be `2` (all islands reachable).
     - Program outputs `2` (correct).
   - **Test Case 2:** \( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - Output should be `1` (island 2 is isolated).
     - Program outputs `1` (correct).
   - **Test Case 3:** \( n = 4 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - Output should be `4` (Everule can still visit all islands).
     - Program outputs `3` (incorrect, should be `4`).
   - **Test Case 4:** \( n = 5 \), \( k = 10 \)
     - Output should be `1` (all bridges can be destroyed).
     - Program outputs `1` (correct).
   - **Test Case 5:** \( n = 5 \), \( k = 3 \)
     - Output should be `5` (Everule can still visit all islands).
     - Program outputs `5` (correct).
   - **Test Case 6:** \( n = 4 \), \( k = 4 \)
     - Output should be `1` (all bridges can be destroyed).
     - Program outputs `1` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `k < n - 1`. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that Everule can only visit `n - 1` islands when `k < n - 1`.
