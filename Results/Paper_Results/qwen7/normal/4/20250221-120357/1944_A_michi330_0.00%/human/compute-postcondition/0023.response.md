Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k within specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2) as part of its input through some external mechanism. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is between 1 and 100, and `k` is between 0 and the maximum combination of choosing 2 items from `n` items. The function then determines and returns a value based on the comparison or relationship between `n` and `k`.
