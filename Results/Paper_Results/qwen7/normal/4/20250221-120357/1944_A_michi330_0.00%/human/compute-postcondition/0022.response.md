Output State: **t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, i is 3, n is the first integer from the input, k is the second integer from the first iteration's input. The values of t, i, n, and k remain unchanged regardless of whether the condition k >= n - 1 is true or false for each iteration.**

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will still hold its initial value, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations (which is `t`), `n` will be the first integer input provided, and `k` will be the second integer input provided during the first iteration. None of these variables change within the loop, so their values remain as they were after the first input.
