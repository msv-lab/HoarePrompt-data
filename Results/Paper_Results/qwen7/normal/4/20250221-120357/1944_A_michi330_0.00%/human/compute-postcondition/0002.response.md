Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is still a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
