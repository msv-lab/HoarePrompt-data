Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than just island 1. Specifically, if `k < n-1`, Everule can still visit all islands except the one that would be isolated by the bridge destructions. 

For example, consider the case `n=4` and `k=1`. The program incorrectly outputs `n-1=3`, but the correct answer should be `3` because destroying one bridge (e.g., between islands 1 and 2) leaves Everule unable to visit island 2, but he can still visit islands 1, 3, and 4. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
