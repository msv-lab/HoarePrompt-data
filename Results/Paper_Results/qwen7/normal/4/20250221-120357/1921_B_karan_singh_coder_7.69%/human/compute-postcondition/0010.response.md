Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in string `t`. Initially, `cnt` is 1. For `i = 1`, the condition `s[1] != t[1]` is evaluated, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters are different. After the first iteration, `cnt` becomes 2. The values of `s1`, `n`, `s`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `i` is updated to 2 for the next iteration.
