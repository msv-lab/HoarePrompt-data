Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than 10**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. However, since `s` and `t` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `s[i]` and `t[i]`. But we know that `i` is 10 and `cnt` was initially 0. Since the condition `s[i] != t[i]` is not specified, we assume it's the first time this condition is being checked and it evaluates to `True`, thus `cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
