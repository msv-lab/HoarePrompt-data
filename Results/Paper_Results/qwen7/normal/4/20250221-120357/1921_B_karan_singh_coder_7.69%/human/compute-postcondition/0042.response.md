Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input itself, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ.
   - `i` is `n`, where `n` is the final value it was set to after the loop condition was no longer met.
   - `s1` is the number of '1's in the input string `s`.
   - `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the user provides input. Therefore, the loop will execute again if the user provides another input.

4. **Adjusting the States**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide another input. This means the loop will run again, and the input will be processed to update the values of `s1` and `t1`.

5. **Update the States**: After the new input, `s1` and `t1` will be updated based on the new strings `s` and `t`. The other states (`cnt`, `i`, `n`, and `d`) will remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are the inputs `s` and `t`, which will be updated to reflect the new input from the user.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `i` is `n`, `n` is the final value it was set to after the loop condition was no longer met, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `i` is `n`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
