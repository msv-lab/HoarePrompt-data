Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in string `t`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, this means `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
