Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 2
   - `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`
   - `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`
   - `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`
   - `s` is the newly input string
   - `t` is the newly input string `t`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 2

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cnt` is 2, `t1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `t`, `s1` is the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `s` is the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string `t`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
