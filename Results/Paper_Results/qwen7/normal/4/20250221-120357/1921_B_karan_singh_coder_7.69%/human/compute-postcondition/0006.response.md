Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s1`, `n`, `s`, or `t1`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that `cnt` is now set to 0.
