Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `i` is 9
   - `n` must be greater than 9

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 9 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it 10.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 10.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `cnt` remains 0 (unchanged)
- `i` becomes 10
- `n` must be greater than 10

So, the updated state is:
State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than 10**
