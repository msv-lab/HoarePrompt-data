Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `s1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `t1` is the number of '1's in the string `t`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` by adding 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. Initially, `i` is 0, so it compares the first character of `s` and `t`. Since `cnt` was initially 0, `cnt` will be incremented by 1 if the first characters of `s` and `t` are different. The values of `s1`, `n`, `s`, `t1`, and `i` remain unchanged.
