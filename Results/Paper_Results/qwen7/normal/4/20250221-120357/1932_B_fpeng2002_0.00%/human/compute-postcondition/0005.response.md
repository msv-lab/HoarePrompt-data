Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`; `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces; `start_year` is 0.**

The code initializes `start_year` to 0, which does not affect the values of `num_tests`, `t`, `n`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
