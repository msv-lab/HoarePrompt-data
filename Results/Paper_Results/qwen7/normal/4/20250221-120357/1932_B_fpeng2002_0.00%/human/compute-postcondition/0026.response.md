Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `len(nums)`, and `start_year` is the result of applying the loop's operation to every element in `nums`.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on `start_year`:

The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list. For each iteration, the value of `start_year` is updated based on the formula:
\[ \text{start_year} = \left(\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) \div \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x] \]

After the loop completes all iterations (i.e., `x` equals the length of `nums`), `start_year` will have been updated through this process for each element in `nums`. Therefore, the final value of `start_year` will be the result of applying the given formula to each element in `nums` sequentially.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` is the cumulative result of applying the operation \((\text{start_year} + 1) \div \text{nums}[x] + 1\) followed by multiplication with `nums[x]` for each element in `nums`.
