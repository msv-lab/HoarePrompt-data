To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initialization**: We start with `start_year` being undefined initially. For simplicity, let's assume it starts as 0 (or any initial value, but it doesn't matter since it gets updated).

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `x = 0` to `x = len(nums) - 1`. After the loop completes, `x` will be set to `len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Formula Application**: In each iteration, the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is applied to update `start_year`.

4. **Final Value Calculation**: Let's denote the length of `nums` as `n`. After the loop, `x` will be `n - 1`. The final value of `start_year` will be the result of applying the formula for `x = n - 1`.

Let's denote the elements of `nums` as `nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[n-1]`.

For the final iteration where `x = n - 1`:
- The formula becomes `((start_year + 1) // nums[n-1] + 1) * nums[n-1]`.

Since the exact values of `start_year` and `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the final value of `start_year` in terms of these variables.

Given the nature of the formula, the final value of `start_year` will be determined by the last application of the formula with `x = n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the final value of `start_year` after all iterations, which is the result of the formula applied for `x = n - 1`.

Output: **(((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1])**
