Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The variables involved here are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is set to iterate over the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list.

3. **Understand the current state before the loop**:
   - `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list (`x` is initially `len(nums)`).
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `start_year` is 0.
   - `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `x` should be set to 0 (the starting point of the range).
   - `len(nums)` should be the actual length of the `nums` list.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `x` should be set to 0.
- `len(nums)` should reflect the actual length of the `nums` list.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`x` is 0, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list**.
