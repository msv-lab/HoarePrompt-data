Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The program only handles the case where `n` equals `k` by printing `YES`, `1`, and `1`. However, the problem statement requires handling more cases, including when `n < k`.
   - For other cases, the program uses a simple division-based approach to determine the number of stalls and their prices, which is not sufficient to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Insufficient Logic for General Cases:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. It simply divides the coins among two stalls without ensuring the greedy selection process results in exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not handle the general case where Alice might need to visit more than two stalls to buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Missing Handling for Multiple Stalls:**
   - The problem allows for up to 60 stalls, but the current implementation only considers up to 2 stalls. This is insufficient to cover all possible scenarios where Alice needs to visit more stalls to buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Ensure that the number of stalls and their prices are set such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- Use a more sophisticated approach to distribute the coins across the stalls, considering the greedy nature of Alice's shopping behavior.

Here’s a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        continue
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    for i in range(1, 61):
        price = n // remaining_jewels
        if price > 10**18:
            break
        stalls.append(price)
        remaining_jewels -= 1
        n -= price
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
    if len(stalls) > 60 or sum(stalls) != k:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(" ".join(map(str, stalls)))
```

This approach ensures that the number of stalls and their prices are set such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
