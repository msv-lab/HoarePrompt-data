Output: **2**

Explanation:
- The initial state provides that `n` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `costs` is a list containing [0, 1].
- The value of `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\). However, since `n` is 0, this formula does not affect `h` because the range would be from 1 to \(0 - k + 1\), which is not valid if \(k > 1\). But since no specific value for `k` is given and the formula does not influence the output of the print statement, `h` remains undefined but does not impact the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the integer 2, regardless of the values of other variables.

Therefore, the output is **2**.
