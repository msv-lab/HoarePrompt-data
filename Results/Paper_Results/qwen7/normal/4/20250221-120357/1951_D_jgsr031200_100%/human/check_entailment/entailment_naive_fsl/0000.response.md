Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to solve the problem using a binary search approach, which is not appropriate for this scenario. The program tries to split the coins into two groups and check if the sum of the groups can match the required number of jewels `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels under the given constraints.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  255 8
  ```

The correct solution would involve setting up stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. However, the provided program fails to achieve this. For instance, with the given input, the program outputs:
```
YES
2
255 1
```

This setup does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly 8 jewels. Instead, Alice would buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 0 jewels from the second stall, resulting in only 1 jewel purchased.

A correct solution would involve dynamically setting the prices for each stall to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The provided program does not handle this requirement correctly.
