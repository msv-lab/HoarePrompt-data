You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1(n, k):
    if (n == k) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return
        #The program returns k, which is equal to n
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is not equal to k
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, and n is greater than or equal to k
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        
        h += curr
        
        n -= i * curr
        
    #State: Output State: `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\), `n` is 0, `i` is the last element of `costs` which is 1, and `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is 1.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #- The loop iterates over each element in `costs`. Initially, `costs` contains `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
    #- In the first iteration, `i` is \(n - k + 1\). We compute `curr` as \(n // (n - k + 1)\) and update `h` and `n` accordingly.
    #- In the second iteration, `i` is 1. We compute `curr` as \(n // 1 = n\) and update `h` and `n` again.
    #- In the third iteration, `i` is 1 again, but since `n` has been reduced to 0, `curr` will be 0, and no further changes to `h` or `n` occur.
    #- This process continues until `n` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
    #- The value of `h` accumulates the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\) because `curr` in each iteration is effectively the integer division of `n` by the current `i` in `costs`.
    #- Since `n` is completely consumed, its final value is 0.
    #- The variable `i` takes on the value of the last element in `costs`, which is 1.
    #- The list `costs` is updated to reflect the fact that the first element (which was \(n - k + 1\)) has been fully processed, so it is set to 0, and the second element remains 1.
    if (h < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: 'NO'
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: 0 1
    #State: `h` is the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n - k + 1\), `n` is 0, `i` is 1, and `costs` is a list containing [0, 1]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers with a constraint of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. It returns k if n is equal to k; otherwise, it returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns k, which is equal to n

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
