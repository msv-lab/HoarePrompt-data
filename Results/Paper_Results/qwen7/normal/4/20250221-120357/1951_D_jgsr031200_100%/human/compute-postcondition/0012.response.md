Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in costs:`. Here, the variable `i` is being iterated over the elements of the `costs` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables involved**:
   - `h` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(n \geq k\).
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is \(n - k + 1\) and the second element is 1.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the `costs` list.
   - In the first iteration, `i` will be set to the first element of `costs`, which is \(n - k + 1\).
   - In the second iteration (if there is one), `i` will be set to the second element of `costs`, which is 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over the elements of `costs`, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and the elements of `costs`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to the first element of `costs`, which is \(n - k + 1\).
- `costs` should be a list containing two elements: \(n - k + 1\) and 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is \(n - k + 1\), `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is \(n - k + 1\) and the second element is 1**.
