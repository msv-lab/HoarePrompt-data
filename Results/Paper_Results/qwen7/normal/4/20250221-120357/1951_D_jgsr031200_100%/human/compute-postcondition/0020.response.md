Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `curr` is 1
- `n` is `n - 1 * 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `costs`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `costs` iterable and the current value of `i` is within the bounds of the `costs` iterable.

### Current Values:
- `i` is currently 1
- `n` is `n - 1`, meaning `n` has been decremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
- Therefore, `i` will become 2.
- The value of `n` remains `n - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be 2.
- `curr` remains unchanged at 1.
- `n` remains `n - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `curr` is 1, `n` is `n - 1`**
