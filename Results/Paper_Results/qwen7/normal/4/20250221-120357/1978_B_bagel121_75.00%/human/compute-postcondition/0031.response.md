Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value derived from `n`, `a`, and `b` using specific formulas.**
