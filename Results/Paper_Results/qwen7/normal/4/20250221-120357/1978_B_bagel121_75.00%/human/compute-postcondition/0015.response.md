Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of the minimum between `b - a + 1` and `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
