Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), `p2` is \((n - k) \times a\), `k` is updated to the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), `p2` is updated to \((n - k) \times a\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p2` to \((n - k) \times a\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states. The value of `k` is already set to the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` is calculated based on this value of `k`.
