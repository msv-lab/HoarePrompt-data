Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

The print statement is `print(n * a)`.

Since `n` and `a` are explicitly defined as input integers, we will use their values directly in the output.

Output: **n * a**
