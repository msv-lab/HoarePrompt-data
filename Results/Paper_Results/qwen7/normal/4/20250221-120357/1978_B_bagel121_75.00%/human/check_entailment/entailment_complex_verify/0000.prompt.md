You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: t must be a positive integer, n is an input integer, a is an input integer, b is an input integer, k is the minimum value between b - a + 1 and n, ans is the integer value of \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), p2 is \((n - k) \times a\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value derived from `n`, `a`, and `b` using specific formulas.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all potential cases. Specifically, the calculation of `k` and the subsequent profit calculation do not account for all possible values of `k` that could yield the maximum profit.

For example, consider the test case `(n=5, a=5, b=9)`:
- The program calculates `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`, which gives `k = 4`.
- It then calculates the profit using `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)` and `p2 = (n - k) * a`, resulting in a profit of `35`.

However, the optimal solution is to set `k = 5`, meaning all buns are sold at the modified price:
- The profit would be `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

The program fails to check if setting `k = n` (i.e., selling all buns at the modified price) results in a higher profit, especially when `b - a + 1 > n`. This oversight causes the program to miss the optimal solution in some cases.
