Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2}\), `p2` is \((n - k) \times a\). If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` and `p2` are calculated accordingly. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` and `p2` are calculated accordingly.
