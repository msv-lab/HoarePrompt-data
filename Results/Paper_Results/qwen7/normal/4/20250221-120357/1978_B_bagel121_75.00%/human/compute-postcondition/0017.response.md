Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of ((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k), `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n - k) * a` to the variable `p2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `n` remains an input integer, `a` remains an input integer, `b` remains an input integer, `k` remains the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, and `ans` remains the integer value of ((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k). The new variable `p2` is now set to `(n - k) * a`.
