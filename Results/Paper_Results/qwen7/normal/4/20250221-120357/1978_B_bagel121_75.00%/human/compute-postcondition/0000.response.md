Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is read during the execution of the code, the value of `t` is now known but unspecified in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain undefined as they have not been assigned any values yet.
