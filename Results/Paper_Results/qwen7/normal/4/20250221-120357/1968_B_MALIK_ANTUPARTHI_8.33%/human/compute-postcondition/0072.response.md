Output State: **`j` is 3, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `j`, `b`, and `k`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is mentioned in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the original values of `j`, `b`, and `k`, along with the indication that a break statement has been executed.
