Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `k` is `j` + 1, and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `b`, `k`, `j`, or `c`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
