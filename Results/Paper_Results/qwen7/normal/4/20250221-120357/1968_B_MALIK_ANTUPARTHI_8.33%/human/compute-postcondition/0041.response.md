Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop head is `for j in range(b)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `b`.

2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `j` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `b` is an input integer.

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute as long as `b` is greater than 0. If `b` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 in the first iteration, we don't need to adjust its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `b` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, `k` is 0**
