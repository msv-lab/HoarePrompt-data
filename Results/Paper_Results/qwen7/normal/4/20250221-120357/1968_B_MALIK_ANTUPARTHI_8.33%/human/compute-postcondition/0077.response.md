Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `c` is an input integer
   - `d` is an input string
   - `e` is an input string
   - `k` is either `b` (if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement for each iteration) or the final value of `k` which is determined by the last successful index match or the last value of `j` plus one if no match is found.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(a):
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `k`) are not directly affected by the loop itself and are not part of the loop head. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

4. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `k` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is either `b` (if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement for each iteration) or the final value of `k` which is determined by the last successful index match or the last value of `j` plus one if no match is found.**
