Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs for `range(b)`, meaning `j` ranges from 0 to `b-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `b`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `b` must be greater than 0, and `j` is some value less than `b`.

3. **Update the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is one less than its initial value for the current iteration.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `c` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `d` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `e` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so if `j` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` will be `x + 1` for the next iteration.
   - Since `j` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` will be `2` for the next iteration.
   - `b` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, and `j` is 2.**
