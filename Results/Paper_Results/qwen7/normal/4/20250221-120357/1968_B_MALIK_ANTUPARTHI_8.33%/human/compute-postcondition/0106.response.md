Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The initial value of `j` is set to `j_prev + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `b` iterations, where `b` is a predefined variable that must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the new state of `j`**: Since the loop starts from `j_prev + 1` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j_prev + 2`.

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `b`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `b`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `j_prev + 2`.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `d[j]` and `e[k:]` are not directly modified by the loop itself but are checked within the loop body. Their states are not adjusted here.
   - `k` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, but since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to know its exact value yet.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `b`.

**State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is `j_prev + 2`**.
