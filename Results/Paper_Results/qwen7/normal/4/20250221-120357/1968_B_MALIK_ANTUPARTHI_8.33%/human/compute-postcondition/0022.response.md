Postcondition: **`k` is the index of `d[j]` in the list `e` plus one, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the second integer input from the user, `j` is 0, `c` is the third integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
