Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is an index, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input from the user, `j` is equal to `b - 1`, `c` is the second integer input from the user, `d` is the third integer input from the user, `e` is an input from the user. If `d[j]` (which is `d[b-1]`) is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of `d[b-1]` in `e` plus `k`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is set to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `k` is either `b` (if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement for each iteration) or the final value of `k` which is determined by the last successful index match or the last value of `j` plus one if no match is found.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `b` remains unchanged, `j` is set to `b - 1`, and `k` is updated based on the conditions within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
