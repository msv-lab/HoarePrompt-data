Postcondition: `i` is 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, and `k` is either `j + 1` (if the character at `d[j]` is found in the substring starting from `e[k:]`), or `j` (if the character at `d[j]` is not found in the substring starting from `e[k:]`). Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.
