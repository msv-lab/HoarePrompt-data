Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to the length of `c`, `slength` remains the same as the initial input integer, `a` remains the same as the initial input string, `b` remains the same as the initial input value, `c` remains the same as the initial input string, and `no` is `False` if any character in `c` was found to be not in both `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `no` remains `True`.**
