Postcondition: `c` must contain at least one element, and `x` will be the next element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is in `a` or `x` is in `b`, the value of `no` remains unchanged and we continue without breaking out of the loop or if statement.
