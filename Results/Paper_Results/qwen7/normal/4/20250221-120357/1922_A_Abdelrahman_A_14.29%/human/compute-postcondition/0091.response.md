Output State: **`x` is an integer not present in either list `a` or `b`; `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `x` or `no`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
