Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` will take on the values of the elements in `c`.
- `c` must contain at least one element.
- `tests` must be greater than `len(c) + 1`.
- The current value of `x` is not in `a` and not in `b`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
