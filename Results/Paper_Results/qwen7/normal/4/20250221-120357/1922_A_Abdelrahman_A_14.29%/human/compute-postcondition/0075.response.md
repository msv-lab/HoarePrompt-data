Output State: **`no` is set to False, `tests` must be greater than the length of the original `c` + 1, `i` is equal to the length of the original `c` + 1, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the input string, `b` is the value of the input() function, `c` is the value entered by the user through input().**

The variable `no` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `tests`, `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
