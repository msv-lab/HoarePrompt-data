Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `no` to `True`, which will be used to determine if the conditions are met.
4. The program checks if `c` is identical to `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints "NO" and sets `no` to `False`.
5. If `c` is not identical to `a` or `b`, it then checks each character in `c` to see if it is not present in both `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" and sets `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.
6. If no such character is found, it prints "NO".
7. The program correctly handles the logic for determining if there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

Given the provided example and the logical flow of the program, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
