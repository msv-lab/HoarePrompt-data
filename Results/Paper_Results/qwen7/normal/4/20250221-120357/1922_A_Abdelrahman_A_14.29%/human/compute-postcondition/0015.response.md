Output State: **`no` is False, `c` must contain at least one element, x is not in a, x is not in b.**

The code `no = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `no`. This does not affect the values of `c`, `a`, `b`, or `x`. Therefore, the conditions that `c` must contain at least one element, `x` is not in `a`, and `x` is not in `b` remain unchanged.
