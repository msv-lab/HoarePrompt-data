Output State: The value of `j` will be equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it will still be less than `m`. Additionally, after all iterations, `b[j]` will not be equal to `a[i]`.

To break it down further:
- `j` starts at its initial value (which is equal to `m`).
- After each iteration of the loop, `j` increases by 1.
- The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.
- Once the loop finishes, `j` will be incremented one more time than the number of times the loop condition was true (i.e., `j` will be equal to the initial value of `j` plus the number of iterations), and `b[j]` will not be equal to `a[i]` because if it were, the loop would have stopped earlier.
