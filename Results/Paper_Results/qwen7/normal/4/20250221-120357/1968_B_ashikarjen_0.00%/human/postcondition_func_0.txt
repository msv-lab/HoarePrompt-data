The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings \(a\) and \(b\) of lengths \(n\) and \(m\) respectively. It counts the number of positions up to which the characters in \(a\) and \(b\) match and prints this count. The function does not return any value but prints the count of matching characters.
