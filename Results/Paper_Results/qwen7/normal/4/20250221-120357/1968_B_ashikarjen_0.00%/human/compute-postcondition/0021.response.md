Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

The `while` loop is:
```python
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine which states need to be adjusted, we need to look at the conditions in the loop head:
1. `j < m`
2. `b[j] != a[i]`

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `j` is still equal to `m`.
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `m` is still the second integer entered.
- `a` is still the string input by the user.
- `b` is still the string input by the user.
- `k` is still 0.
- `i` is now `0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `j < m`:**
   - Currently, `j` is equal to `m`.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `m`.
   - Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - Currently, `i` is `0`.
   - The condition checks if `b[j]` is not equal to `a[0]`.
   - Since `j` is equal to `m`, `b[j]` would be out of bounds if `j` were to remain `m`.
   - However, since `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`, this condition will naturally hold as long as `j` is within the valid range of `b`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be less than `m`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is less than `m`**
