Postcondition: **`j` is equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is 0, and for every index `i` from 0 to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`. The current value of `j` is less than `m`.**
