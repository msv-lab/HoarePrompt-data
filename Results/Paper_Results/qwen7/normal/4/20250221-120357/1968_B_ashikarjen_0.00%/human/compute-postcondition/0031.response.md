Output State: **`k` is increased by 1, `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus 1, and it is still less than `m`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is equal to its initial value plus the total number of iterations the loop executed (and is still less than `m`), after executing the code, `j` will be equal to its initial value plus 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
