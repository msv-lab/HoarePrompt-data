Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration: `j` is equal to `j` + 1 and is still less than `m`.
- The `while` loop condition: `while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains two conditions: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition is `j < m`.
   - The second condition is `b[j] != a[i]`.

3. **Analyze the Given State:**
   - We know that `j` is equal to `j` + 1 and is still less than `m`. This means `j + 1 < m`.

4. **Adjust States for Loop Execution:**
   - Since `j + 1 < m` is given, we can infer that `j < m` is true.
   - However, we need to ensure that `b[j] != a[i]` is also true for the loop to continue.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration already satisfies `j < m`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, we need to ensure that `b[j] != a[i]` remains true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is equal to `j` + 1 and is still less than `m`, and `b[j] != a[i]` must remain true**
