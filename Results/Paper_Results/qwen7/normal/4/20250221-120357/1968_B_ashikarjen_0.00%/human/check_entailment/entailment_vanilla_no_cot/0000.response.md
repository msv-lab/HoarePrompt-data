Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, and then reads the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `k` and `j` to 0. `k` will store the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` will be used to traverse through `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`**: The function iterates through each character of string `a` using a for loop. For each character `a[i]`:
   - It uses a while loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in string `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If such a character is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next position in `b`.
   - If no such character is found, the loop breaks, indicating that the remaining part of `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case, adhering to the problem requirements. Therefore, the provided function is correct.
