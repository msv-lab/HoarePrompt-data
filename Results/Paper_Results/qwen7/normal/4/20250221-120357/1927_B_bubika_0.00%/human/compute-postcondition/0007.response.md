Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers, `r` is an empty string, `x` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` attempts to find the index of `i` in the list `b`. However, there are no variables named `b` or `i` defined in the given initial state. Therefore, the code will raise a NameError because `b` and `i` are not defined. Since the code fails to execute, the only variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged, and `x` is left undefined.
