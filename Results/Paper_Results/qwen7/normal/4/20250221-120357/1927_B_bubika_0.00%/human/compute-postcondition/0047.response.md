Output State: **`t` is 5, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers, `r` is `a[x]` added to `r`, `x` is assigned the index of `i` in `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1, where `x` is the index of `i` in `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
