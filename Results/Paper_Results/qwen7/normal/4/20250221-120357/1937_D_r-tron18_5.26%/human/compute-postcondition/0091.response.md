Postcondition: `i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ans[i]` is adjusted based on the condition `zr <= ol`: if `zr <= ol`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr > ol`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`. `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it, and `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.
