Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `zeroInd` is greater than `ol`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**.

In this output state, the value of `oneInd` is updated to `2 * preOne[-1]`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
