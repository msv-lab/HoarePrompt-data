Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to compute a value based on the accumulated array and a time parameter.
   - The function seems to be calculating a specific index or value from the accumulated array, but its exact purpose is not clear without more context.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to solve the main problem of determining how long it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses several arrays:
     - `pre`: Stores positions where the character is `'>'".
     - `totalOne`: Total number of `'>''` characters.
     - `preOne`: Accumulated values of `pre`.
     - `suffZero`: Accumulated values of positions where the character is `'<'`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward through the string `s1` and calculates the time for a pinball to leave the grid for each position.
   - Depending on whether the current character is `'>''` or `'<'`, different calculations are performed using the accumulated arrays and the `func_1` function.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is initialized with positions of `'>''` characters.
   - `totalOne` is set to the count of `'>''` characters.
   - `preOne` is accumulated from `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is initialized with a single element `[0]`.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
     - If the character at `i` is `'>''`:
       - Calculate `zeroInd` and `oneInd` based on the accumulated arrays and the `func_1` function.
       - Update the answer for the current position `i`.
     - If the character at `i` is `'<'`:
       - Update `suffZero` and recalculate `zeroInd` and `oneInd` similarly.

3. **Printing Results**:
   - The results are printed after processing all positions.

### Correctness Check

1. **Accumulation and Calculation**:
   - The accumulation of positions and the use of `func_1` seem to be correctly implemented for the given logic.
   - However, the exact correctness of `func_1` is not clear without more context, but it appears to be a helper function for the main calculation.

2. **Backward Iteration Logic**:
   - The logic for handling both `'>''` and `'<'` characters seems to be correctly implemented.
   - The use of accumulated arrays and the `func_1` function appears to be consistent with the problem requirements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the pinball leaving the grid from the left or right boundary correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic for determining how long it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The use of accumulated arrays and the `func_1` function seems appropriate for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
