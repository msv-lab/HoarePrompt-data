Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, len(suffZero) - 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**.

This means that the value of `ans[i]` has been calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
