Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not accurately reflect the rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed and does not correctly account for the inversion of the direction and the movement of the pinball based on the grid configuration. The solution needs to re-evaluate the position and direction of the pinball after each move and handle the inversion of directions properly.
