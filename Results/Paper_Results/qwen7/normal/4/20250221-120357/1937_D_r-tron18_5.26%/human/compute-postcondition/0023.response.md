The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. This operation directly affects the `preOne` list. Since no other variables are mentioned or affected by this operation, the only change is to `preOne`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `n-2`
- `el` is `'> '`
- `ol` is `totalOne`
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`
- If `totalOne` is less than or equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.

After executing `preOne.pop()`, the length of `preOne` is reduced by one, but the values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation.

Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `preOne` has been modified to remove its last element.**
