Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The code defines a new variable `fi` which is calculated as the difference between two calls to the function `func_1`. Specifically, `fi` is set to the value of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, zr)`. None of the other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
