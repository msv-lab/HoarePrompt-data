Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; and `n`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s1`. The function returns a value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.**

- If the number of '<' characters is greater than the number of '>' characters, the function returns the difference.
- If the number of '>' characters is greater than the number of '<' characters, the function returns the negative of the difference.
- If the number of '<' characters equals the number of '>' characters, the function returns 0.
