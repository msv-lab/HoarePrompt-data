Output State: **All elements in `ans` are filled according to the logic defined within the loop, `totalOne` is 0, `preOne` is an empty list, and `suffZero` contains the cumulative sum of indices from the end of `s1` for each occurrence of '<'.**

To understand this output state:
- The loop iterates from the end of the string `s1` towards the beginning. For each character, it updates the `ans` list based on certain conditions involving `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`.
- After all iterations, `totalOne` will be 0 because it is decremented each time a '>' is encountered.
- `preOne` becomes an empty list since it is popped each time a '>' is processed.
- `suffZero` accumulates the cumulative sum of indices from the end of `s1` for each occurrence of '<'.
- Each element in `ans` is filled based on the calculations performed during the loop iterations, reflecting the relative positions of '>' and '<' in `s1`.
