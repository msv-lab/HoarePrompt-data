Postcondition: `i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. Depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` or `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` or `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `totalOne` is either `totalOne - 1` or `totalOne`, and `preOne` is either updated by removing its last element or unchanged. `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd`. `suffZero` is either updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it or unchanged.
