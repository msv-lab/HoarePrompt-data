Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `el - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol` or `el - oneInd` if `zr > ol`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to it, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates `oneInd` to `2 * preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `oneInd` is used in the calculation of `ans[i]` depending on the condition `zr <= ol`. The `suffZero` list is appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and `ol` and `zr` are updated accordingly.
