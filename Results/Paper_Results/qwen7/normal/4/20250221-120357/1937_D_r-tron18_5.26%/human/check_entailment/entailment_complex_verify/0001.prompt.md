You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    #This is printed: the elements of the list ans (where the elements were determined by the logic within the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element represents the balance of '<' and '>' characters up to that position in the string `s1`. The balance is determined based on the number of '>' characters encountered so far and the number of '<' characters from the end of the string up to that position. The function updates the list `ans` by iterating through the string `s1` from the end to the beginning and performing the necessary calculations. After completing the iteration, the function prints the elements of the list `ans`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains a character `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the character.
   - The direction of the cell is reversed after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Given Code Overview**:
   - The code includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that seems to perform some arithmetic operations.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input and calculates the time for each pinball starting position.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an array `arr` and an integer `times`.
   - It returns a value derived from the last element of `arr` and a maximum value calculated from `times`.
   - The logic here is not clear without more context, but it seems to be related to calculating positions or indices.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and the length `n`.
   - It initializes some lists and accumulates values.
   - It iterates backward through the string and calculates the time for each pinball starting position.
   - The logic involves maintaining counts of `>` and `<`, and using these counts to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is initialized with positions where the character is `>`.
   - `totalOne` is the count of such positions.
   - `preOne` is accumulated using `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is initialized with zeros.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - For each position `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
     - If the character is `>`:
       - Calculate indices and adjust the results based on the counts of `>` and `<`.
       - Update `preOne` and `totalOne`.
     - If the character is `<`:
       - Adjust `suffZero` and calculate the time based on the counts of `>` and `<`.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time calculation involves complex arithmetic and conditional checks.
   - The logic seems to handle the movement of the pinball and the reversal of directions correctly.

### Correctness Check

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases like the pinball leaving the grid from the left or right boundary.
  - It correctly updates the counts and positions as the pinball moves.

- **General Logic**:
  - The logic for updating the counts and positions seems consistent with the problem description.
  - The arithmetic operations in `func_1` and the overall structure of `func_2` appear to be correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given code appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

**Correctness: True**
