Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `el` is not `'>'; suffZero` is `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `zeroInd` is greater than `ol`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` using the function `func_1`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we know that `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
