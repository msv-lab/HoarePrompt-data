Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - The current state of the program has entered the if condition where the first three elements of `a` are all odd numbers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. Since the if condition has already been met (the first three elements of `a` are odd), the loop will start executing with the first element of `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `x` will take the value of the first element of `a` during the first iteration of the loop.
   - The list `a` will remain the same as it was before the loop started.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `x` should be set to the first element of `a`.
- `a` should retain its current state (list of integers).

Therefore, the final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`x` is the first element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
