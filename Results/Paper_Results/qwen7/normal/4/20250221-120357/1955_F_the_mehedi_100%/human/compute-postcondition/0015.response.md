Output State: `x` is the last element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is the sum of 4 (from the first iteration) plus the floor division of each subsequent element of `a` by 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

In this final state, `x` will be the last element processed by the loop from the list `a`. The variable `cnt` will have been incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that was processed, starting from 3 (as given by the state after the first iteration). Therefore, `cnt` will be equal to 3 plus the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.
