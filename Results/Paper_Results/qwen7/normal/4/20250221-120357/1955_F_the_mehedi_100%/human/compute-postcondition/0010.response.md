Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in a:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is the first element of `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `cnt` is 3.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Determine how the loop modifies these variables**:
   - In each iteration, `x` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged within the loop.

4. **Calculate the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` was the first element of `a` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `x` will be the second element of `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `x` will now be the second element of `a`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `cnt` is not modified by the loop itself, so it remains 3.
   - `t` is not modified by the loop itself, so it remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is the second element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
