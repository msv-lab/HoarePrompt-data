Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `x`.
   - The loop iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must have at least one element less than the previous `x`.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the new `x` by 2.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element less than the previous `x`.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the new `x` by 2.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `a` is a list and it must have at least one element less than the previous `x`, for the loop to continue, `a` must still meet this condition.
   - `cnt` will be increased by the floor division of the current `x` by 2.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `a` must still have at least one element less than the previous `x`.
- `cnt` will be increased by the floor division of the current `x` by 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element less than the previous `x`, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the current `x` by 2**
