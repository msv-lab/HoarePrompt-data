Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented from 0 up to but not including `int(input())`.

3. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the first iteration will check if `0 < int(input())`, which is always true as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` determines how many times the loop will run. It must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

5. **Adjusting the State**: We need to ensure that `int(input())` is a valid positive integer within the specified range and that `i` starts at 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.
