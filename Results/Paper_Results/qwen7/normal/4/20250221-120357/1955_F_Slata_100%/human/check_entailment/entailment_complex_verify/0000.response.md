### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

#### Key Points:
1. **Calculation of Output**:
   - The program calculates the sum of half the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (using integer division).
   - It also adds 1 if the sum of the remainders when dividing the counts by 2 equals 3.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `1 1 1 0`, the program outputs `1`.
     - Half of 1 (1s) is `0` (since `1 // 2 = 0`).
     - Half of 1 (2s) is `0`.
     - Half of 1 (3s) is `0`.
     - Half of 0 (4s) is `0`.
     - The sum of remainders (`1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2`) is `3`, so it adds 1.
     - Total: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine the maximum number of Bob's wins, we need to consider the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - The count of 4s does not affect the parity since XOR of any number with itself is zero.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s to make the XOR result zero.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct solution should output the minimum of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

#### Evaluation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly states that the program calculates the sum of half the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, plus an additional 1 if the sum of the remainders equals 3.
- This approach does not correctly reflect the game logic where the goal is to make the XOR result zero by minimizing the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of Bob's wins. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
Final: **False**
