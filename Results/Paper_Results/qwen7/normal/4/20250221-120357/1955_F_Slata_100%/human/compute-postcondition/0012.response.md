Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these counts. Specifically, it computes the sum of half the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (using integer division), plus an additional 1 if the sum of the remainders when dividing the counts by 2 equals 3. The function executes this process for up to 10,000 test cases.**
