Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function matches the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by optimally removing numbers.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit (considering each number as a binary representation) is even.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers that help achieve this condition.

3. **Given Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` which represents the maximum number of pairs of numbers that can be removed without changing the parity of the counts (since removing a pair does not change the parity).
   - It also adds `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` which checks if the sum of the remainders when divided by 2 equals 3. This part is crucial because it accounts for the exact condition where the XOR would be zero if these specific counts are removed.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the first example (1 1 1 0): 
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
     - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3) = int(1 + 1 + 1 == 3) = 1`
     - Result: `0 + 1 = 1` (correct)
   - For the second example (1 0 1 2):
     - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
     - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3) = int(1 + 0 + 1 == 3) = 0`
     - Result: `1 + 0 = 1` (correct)

Based on the analysis and verification, the logic in the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize Bob's wins.

Correctness: **True**
