Based on the initial state provided:

- `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`.
- `i` is equal to `k`.
- `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`. The current value of `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
