Postcondition: **`favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k`, and `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `removed_count` is incremented by 1.**
