Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's steps and how they align with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Extracting Test Case Details**: For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. **Reading Cube Values**: It then reads the values shown on the cubes into a list `a`.
4. **Finding Favorite Value**: The program identifies the value of the favorite cube by accessing `a[f - 1]`.
5. **Sorting and Counting**: It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order and counts the occurrences of the favorite value in both the original list and the sorted list.
6. **Determining Removal Status**: 
   - If the number of times the favorite value appears in the top `k` elements of the sorted list is equal to the total number of times it appears in the entire list, it prints 'YES'.
   - If the favorite value does not appear in the top `k` elements at all, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the logical flow and the specific conditions checked, the program accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed based on the criteria provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
