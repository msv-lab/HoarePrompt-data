Based on the initial state provided:

- `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k-1` elements of `sorted_a`.
- `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be described since the output is explicitly stated.
