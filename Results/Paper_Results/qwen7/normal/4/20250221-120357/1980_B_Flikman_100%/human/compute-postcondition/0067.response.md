Output State: **`n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers inputted by the user, `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k`, `removed_count` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`, and `t` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The other variables (`favorite_count`, `i`, `removed_count`, and `t`) remain unchanged in their described roles and conditions.
