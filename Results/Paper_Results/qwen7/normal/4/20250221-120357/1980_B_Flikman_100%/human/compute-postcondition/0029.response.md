Based on the initial state provided:

- `favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a` up to index `i`.
- `i` is equal to `k-1`, and `k` is greater than 0.
- `removed_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` was found in `sorted_a` up to index `i`, and `removed_count` is greater than 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

The string `'MAYBE'` is directly printed without any variable substitution since no variables are referenced in the print statement.

Output: **MAYBE**
