Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, and `removed_count` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Given that initially `removed_count` is 1 (if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value`) or 0 (if `sorted_a[2]` does not equal `favorite_value`), it now becomes 2. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
