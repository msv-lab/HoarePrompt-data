Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 to 1000), `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged.
