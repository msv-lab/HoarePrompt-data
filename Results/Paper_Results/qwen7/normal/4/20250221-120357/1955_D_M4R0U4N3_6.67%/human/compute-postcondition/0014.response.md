Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` is at least 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split
   - `todo` is a set containing integers
   - `done` is an empty set
   - Either `extra` is an empty set with `a[j]` removed from `todo` and added to `done`, or `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` with `a[j]` added to `extra`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0 and `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute again if `j` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` becomes 1.
   - `m` remains at least 1 (it does not change in the loop head).

6. **Other states remain the same**:
   - `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` do not change based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers, `done` is an empty set, and either `extra` is an empty set with `a[j]` removed from `todo` and added to `done`, or `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` with `a[j]` added to `extra`.**
