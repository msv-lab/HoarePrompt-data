Output State: **`ans` is 2, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `extra` now contains `a[r]`, the conditions involving `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `r` is defined as `m + 1`, `r - m` simplifies to 1, making `old` equal to `a[1]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
