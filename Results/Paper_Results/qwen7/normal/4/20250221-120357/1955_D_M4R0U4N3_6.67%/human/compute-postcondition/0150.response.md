Output State: **`ans` is 2, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since `r` is initially `m + 1`, the expression `r - m` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `old` now holds the value of `a[1]`. The values of `ans` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
