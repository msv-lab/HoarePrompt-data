Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is a set containing `a[0]`, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[j]`, `j` is 1, `todo` does not contain `a[j]`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` (where `j` is 1) to the set `done`. Since `done` was previously either an empty set or a set containing `a[0]`, after adding `a[1]`, `done` now contains both `a[0]` and `a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
