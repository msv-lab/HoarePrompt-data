Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and splits them into `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state and is not affected by the input operation.
