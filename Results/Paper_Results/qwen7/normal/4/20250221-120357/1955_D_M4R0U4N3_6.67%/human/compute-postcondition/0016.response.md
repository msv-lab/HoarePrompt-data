Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1, `todo` list has the element at index `j` removed.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element at index `j` from the list `todo`. Given that `j` is 1, the element at index 1 of the `todo` list is removed. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged, and the condition that `m` is at least 1 still holds.
