Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `m`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values for These Variables**: 
   - `j` should start at 0 because the `range(m)` function generates values from 0 to `m-1`.
   - `m` should be the value provided by the user.

3. **Consider the Context and Constraints**:
   - The number of iterations left to execute is one less than the previous iteration. This implies that `m` should be a positive integer (since it represents the number of iterations).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` needs to be initialized to 0.
   - `m` needs to be set to the value provided by the user.

Given these considerations, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0**.
