Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `j` is equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set that may contain some integers, `done` is a set that contains integers that were found in `todo` and removed from it, and `extra` is a set that contains integers that were not found in `todo` but were present in `a`.**

This means that the value of `ans` is determined by comparing the length of the set `done` with the integer `k`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
