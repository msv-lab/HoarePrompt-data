The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the integer `m`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `m` is the integer input from the user.
- `k` is an integer input from the user.
- `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set.
- `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[j]`.
- `j` is either 1 or 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently either 1 or 0, it needs to be incremented to 1 if it is 0, or remain 1 if it is already 1. However, since the loop will only execute if `j < m`, and `j` is currently either 1 or 0, `j` will become 1 if it was 0, and the loop will continue as long as `m` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[j]`, and `j` is 1**.
