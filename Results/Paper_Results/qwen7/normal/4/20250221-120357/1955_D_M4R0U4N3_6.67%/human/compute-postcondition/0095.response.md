Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `m` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, the number of iterations left to execute is one less than the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. It does not affect the number of iterations left to execute, which is mentioned as being one less than the previous iteration. Therefore, the number of iterations left remains unchanged in terms of its relationship to the previous iteration count.
