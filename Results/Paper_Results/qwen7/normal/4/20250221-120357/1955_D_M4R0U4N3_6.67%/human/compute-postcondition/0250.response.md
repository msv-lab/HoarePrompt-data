Output State: **`r` is `r_end + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` does not include `old`, `todo` includes `old`, `extra` is `extra - {old}`, `done` is `done - {old}`, `todo` is `todo + {old}` if `old` was in `done`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. Given the initial conditions, we know:

- `r` is `r_end + 1`.
- `old` is `a[r - m]`.

After removing `a[r]` from `todo`, the following changes occur:
- Since `old` is `a[r - m]`, and `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, `todo` now includes `old` (if `old` was previously in `done`).
- `extra` does not contain `old` because `old` is removed from `extra` if it was there.
- `done` does not include `old` because `old` is removed from `done`.
- `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and `todo.add(old)` has been executed.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
