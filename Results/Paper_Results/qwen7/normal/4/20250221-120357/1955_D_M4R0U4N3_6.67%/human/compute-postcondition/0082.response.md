Postcondition: `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; `old` is either no longer assigned the value of `a[r - m]` because `extra.remove(old)` has been executed, or `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, and if `old` was in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `todo` now contains `old`.
