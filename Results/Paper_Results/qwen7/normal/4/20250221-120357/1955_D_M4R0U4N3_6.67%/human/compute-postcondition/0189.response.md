Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set.**

The code initializes the variable `done` as an empty set. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `done`.
