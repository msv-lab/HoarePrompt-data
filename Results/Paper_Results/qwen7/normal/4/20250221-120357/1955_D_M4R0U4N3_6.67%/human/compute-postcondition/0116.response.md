Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers excluding `a[j]`, `done` is a set containing `a[j]`, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]` if `a[j_end_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise it does not contain `a[j_end_prev + 1]`**

The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
