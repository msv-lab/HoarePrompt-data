Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is not in `todo`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`; otherwise, `old` is added to `todo`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. Since `a[r]` was previously in `todo`, it is now removed. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
