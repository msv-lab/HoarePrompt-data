Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.
3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `m` is the integer input from the user.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user.
   - `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set.
   - `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]`. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `extra` does not contain `a[j]`; otherwise, `extra` contains the element `a[1]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and checked against `m`.
   - Since `m` is fixed and does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `j` was `j_end_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_end_prev + 1`.

5. **New State**:
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `todo` remains the same.
   - `done` remains the same.
   - `extra` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new state of `j` will be `j_end_prev + 1`.

**Final State**:
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `m` is the integer input from the user.
- `k` is an integer input from the user.
- `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set.
- `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]`. If `a[j_end_prev + 1]` is in `todo`, then `extra` does not contain `a[j_end_prev + 1]`; otherwise, `extra` contains the element `a[1]`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]` if `a[j_end_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise it does not contain `a[j_end_prev + 1]`**
