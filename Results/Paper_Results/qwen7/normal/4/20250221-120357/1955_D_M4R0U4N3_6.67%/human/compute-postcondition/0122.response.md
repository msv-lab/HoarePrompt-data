Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[r - m]` and `r` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. The values of `ans`, `r`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `ans` depends on the length of `done` being greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `r` is still required to be less than `n`.
