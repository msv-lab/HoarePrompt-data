Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[1]` if `a[j_end_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, otherwise it does not contain `a[j_end_prev + 1]`, `extra` now contains the element `a[j]`**.

Explanation: The line `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `extra` will now include `a[j]` if it was not already present. All other variables remain unchanged.
