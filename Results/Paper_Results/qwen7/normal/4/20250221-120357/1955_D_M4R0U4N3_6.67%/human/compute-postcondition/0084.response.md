Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is neither in `done` nor `extra`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; if `old` was in `extra`, `extra.remove(old)` is executed and `old` is no longer assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` was in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `todo` now contains `old`.**

Explanation: The line `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Since `r` is defined as `m + 2`, `a[r]` is the element at index `m + 2` in the list `a`. The conditions related to `done`, `extra`, `old`, and `ans` remain unchanged unless the specified conditions are met (length of `done` >= `k`), in which case `ans` would be increased by 1 and `todo` would be updated accordingly. However, since no such condition is explicitly triggered by this line of code, the conditions remain as they were.
