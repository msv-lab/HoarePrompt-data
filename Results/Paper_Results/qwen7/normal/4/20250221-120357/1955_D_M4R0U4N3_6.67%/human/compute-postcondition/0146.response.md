Output State: **`ans` is 2, `r` is `m`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `old` is either already in `done` or has been added to `todo`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 2. The values of `r`, `old`, and the conditions related to `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged from the initial state.
