Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[j]` is in `todo`.
