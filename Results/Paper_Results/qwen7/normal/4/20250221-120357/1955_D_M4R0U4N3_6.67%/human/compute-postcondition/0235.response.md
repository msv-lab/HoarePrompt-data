Postcondition: `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is found in `extra`, then `old` is no longer in `extra`. If `old` is found in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `old` remains unchanged in `todo`. Additionally, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `a[r]` is added to `extra` and `old` remains unchanged in `todo`.
