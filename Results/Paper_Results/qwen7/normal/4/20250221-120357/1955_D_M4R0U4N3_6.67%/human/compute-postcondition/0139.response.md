Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `done` contains `a[r]`; `todo` does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. This changes the state of the variable `done` to include `a[r]`. The other variables (`ans`, `r`, `old`, and `todo`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
