Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, and `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing the element `a[j]` where `j` is 1. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `extra` does not contain `a[j]`; otherwise, `extra` contains the element `a[1]`**.
