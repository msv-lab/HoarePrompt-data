Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since `r` is `m + 2`, `r - m` simplifies to 2. Therefore, `old` is now holding the value of `a[2]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
