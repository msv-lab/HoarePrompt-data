Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo`, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. This affects the state of the variable `old`, which is added to `done`. The value of `r` remains unchanged, as it is not directly used in the code. The `ans` variable is increased by 1, indicating some kind of counter or score increment. The `todo` and `extra` sets are updated based on the current state of `old`, meaning if `old` was previously in `todo` or `extra`, these sets are modified accordingly.
