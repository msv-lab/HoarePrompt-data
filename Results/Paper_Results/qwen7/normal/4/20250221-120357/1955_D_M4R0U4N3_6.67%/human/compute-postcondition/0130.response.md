Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` - 1, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `old` is no longer in `done`.**

Explanation: The code removes `old` from the list `done`. This action affects the condition that determines the value of `ans`. Since `old` was previously in `done`, its removal changes the length of `done`. Therefore, the new condition for `ans` is that it is 1 if the length of `done` is now greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0. The values of `r`, `old`, and the fact that `old` is no longer in `done` remain unchanged.
