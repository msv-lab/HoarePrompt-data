Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is the integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is a set containing all elements from `todo` that were found in `a`, and `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo`.**

In this final state, every element in `todo` that exists in the list `a` will be removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Conversely, any element in `a` that was not in `todo` will be added to `extra`. The values of `m`, `k`, and the original `a` list will remain as they were initially provided, and the sets `done` and `extra` will reflect the results of the entire loop execution.
