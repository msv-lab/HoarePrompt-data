Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 3; `r` is `m + 2`; `extra` is modified by removing `old`, where `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Here, `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`, which means `old` is the element at index `r - m` in the list `a`. Since `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[(m + 2) - m]`, which simplifies to `a[2]`. After executing `extra.remove(old)`, the list `extra` will no longer contain the element `a[2]`. The values of `ans`, `r`, and the expression for `old` remain unchanged.
