Postcondition: `r` is `r_end + 1`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` are updated as follows:
- If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` does not contain `old`.
- `done` includes `a[r_end + 1]` if it was in `todo`, and `done` does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`.
- `todo` does not include `a[r_end + 1]` if it was in `todo` and includes `old` if `old` was in `done`.
- `extra` is `extra - {old}` if `old` was in `extra`.
- `done` is `done - {old}`.
- `todo` is `todo + {old}` if `old` was in `done` and `todo.add(old)` has been executed.
