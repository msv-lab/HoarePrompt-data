Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `old` is either already in `done` or has been added to `todo`. Regardless of whether `a[r]` is in `todo` or `extra`, `old` remains unchanged and is either in `done` or `todo`.
