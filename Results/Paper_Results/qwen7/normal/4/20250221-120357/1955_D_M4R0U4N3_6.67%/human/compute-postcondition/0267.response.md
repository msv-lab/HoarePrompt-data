Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is now in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo`, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`**.

Explanation: The code removes `a[r]` from the `todo` list. This action does not change the values of `r`, `old`, `ans`, `extra`, or the condition that `r` remains either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`. The states of `extra` and `todo` are updated based on the original conditions provided, meaning that if `old` was in `extra`, it is no longer there, and if `old` was in `todo`, it is removed.
