Output State: **`p1` is unchanged, `p2` is unchanged, `x` is increased by 1, `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `y` was initially greater than or equal to `x`, after incrementing `x`, `y` remains greater than or equal to the new value of `x`.
