Output State: The loop will continue to execute until either the condition `y >= x` is no longer true or the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, causing the loop to break.

To determine the final output state, we need to consider the possible scenarios:

1. If the loop breaks due to `p1 - x <= p2 - y` being true, the program will print `p1 - x + p3` and exit.
2. If the loop does not break and `y < x` when the loop exits (due to the `else` clause), the program will print `p3`.

Given the conditions and the behavior described, let's summarize the final state:

- If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true at any point during the loop, the loop will break and print `p1 - x + p3`.
- If the loop completes without breaking, it will print `p3`.

Since the loop will continue to adjust `x` and `y` until one of these conditions is met, the final output will be determined by the last value of `p1 - x` compared to `p2 - y`.

Output State: The output will be either `p1 - x + p3` if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` becomes true, or `p3` if the loop completes without breaking.
