Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user and must be an odd number, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 1 (since `x` was 0 and was incremented by 1), `y` is `p3` and must be greater than or equal to 0, and `p1 - x > p2 - y`.**

In this output state, the variable `x` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, including the condition that `p1 - x > p2 - y` still holds true.
