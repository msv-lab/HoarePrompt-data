Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 0, and `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t` and `_`. The values of `x` and `y` are initialized to 0. Since the loop conditions and changes to these variables are not specified in the given code snippet, `x` and `y` remain 0.
