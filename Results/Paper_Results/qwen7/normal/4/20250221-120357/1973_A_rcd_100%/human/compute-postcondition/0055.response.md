Based on the initial state provided:

- `p1` is an integer entered by the user.
- `p2` is an integer entered by the user.
- `p3` is an integer entered by the user and must be an odd number.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `_` is 2.
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is `p3` and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true.

Given these conditions, we know the following:

- Since `x` is 0, `p1 - x` simplifies to `p1`.
- Since `y` is `p3`, the expression `p2 - y` becomes `p2 - p3`.

The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` translates to `p1 <= p2 - p3`. This condition is already satisfied according to the postcondition.

Now, let's evaluate the expression `p1 - x + p3`:

- `p1 - x` is `p1` because `x` is 0.
- Adding `p3` to `p1` gives us `p1 + p3`.

Therefore, the expression `p1 - x + p3` evaluates to `p1 + p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
