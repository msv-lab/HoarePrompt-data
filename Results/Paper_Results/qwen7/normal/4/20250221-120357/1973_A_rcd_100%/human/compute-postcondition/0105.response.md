Output State: **`p1` is its original value, `p2` is its original value, `x` is its original value, `y` is its original value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `x`, and `y`. It only indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional block. Given the initial state where `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, this relationship remains unchanged.
