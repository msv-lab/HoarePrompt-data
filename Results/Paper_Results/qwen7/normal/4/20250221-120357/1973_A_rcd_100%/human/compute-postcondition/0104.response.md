Based on the initial state provided:

- `p1` and `p3` are not explicitly defined with specific values.
- `x` and `y` are such that `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

Since `p1` and `p3` do not have explicit values, they will remain as they are in the expression. The value of `x` is not specified, but it is part of the expression. Therefore, the expression will evaluate to `p1 - x + p3`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3**
