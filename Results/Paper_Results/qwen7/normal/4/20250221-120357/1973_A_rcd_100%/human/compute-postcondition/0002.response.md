Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `_` is not affected by this code. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `_` remains 1. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are set to the integers entered by the user.
