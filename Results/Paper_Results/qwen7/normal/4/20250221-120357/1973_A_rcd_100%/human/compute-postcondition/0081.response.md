Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0 and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain the same.
