Output State: `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user and must be an odd number, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 0 (or any value it reached during the last iteration which is between 0 and 4), `y` is 0 (since `y` will decrement until it reaches 0 as the loop continues and `y >= x` must hold true).

**Explanation:** After all iterations of the loop, the loop condition `y >= x` will eventually fail because `y` will reach 0 and cannot be greater than or equal to `x` (which will be non-negative). At this point, the `else` block will execute, printing the value of `p3`. Therefore, the final output state will have `x` and `y` set to values that satisfy the loop's termination condition, with the primary output being `p3`.
