Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and either:
- `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, in which case the current values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, and `_` are unchanged.
- Or, the loop will terminate after a finite number of iterations based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, the variable `_` will be 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` being true, otherwise it will remain 1. The variables `x` and `y` will have reached their final values where `x` is the number of times the loop iterated without breaking (i.e., when `p1 - x > p2 - y`), and `y` will be `p3 - x`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will remain as they were initially entered by the user, and `t` will retain its initial value since it is not affected by the loop.
