Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The conditions about the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being odd, `t` being a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` being 1, `x` being 0, and `y` being 0 remain unchanged because these variables are not affected by the input operation.
