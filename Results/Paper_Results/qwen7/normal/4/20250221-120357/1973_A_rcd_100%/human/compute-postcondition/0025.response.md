Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`. After executing the if-else block, `x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1`, and `p1 - x` is either less than or equal to `p2 - y` or greater than `p2 - y`.
