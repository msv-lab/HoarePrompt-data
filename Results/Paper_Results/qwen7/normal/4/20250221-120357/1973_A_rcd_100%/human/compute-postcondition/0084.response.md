Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and the program continues the loop.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `x`. Since the initial state of `x` was 0, its value remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states as well.
