Output State: The loop will terminate after a finite number of iterations based on the conditions provided. After all iterations, the variable `_` will be 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` being true, otherwise it will remain 1. The variables `x` and `y` will have reached their final values where `x` is the number of times the loop iterated without breaking (i.e., when `p1 - x > p2 - y`), and `y` will be `p3 - x`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will remain as they were initially entered by the user, and `t` will retain its initial value since it is not affected by the loop.

In summary, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `_`: 0 if the loop breaks, 1 otherwise.
- `x`: Number of times the loop iterated without breaking.
- `y`: `p3 - x`.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`: Values entered by the user.
- `t`: Initial value, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
