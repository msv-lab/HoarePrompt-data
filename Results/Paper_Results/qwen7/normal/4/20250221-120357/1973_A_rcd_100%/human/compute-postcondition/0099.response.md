Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement present in the initial state, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. No variables are affected, so the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
