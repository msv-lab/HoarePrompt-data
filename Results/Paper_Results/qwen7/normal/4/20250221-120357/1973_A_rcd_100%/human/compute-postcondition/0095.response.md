Postcondition: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`, `_`, `x`, and `y` are as follows: 
- If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `p1 - x > p2 - y`, then `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`. 

In other words, the program either breaks out of the loop or if statement when `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, or sets `x` to 1 and `y` to `p3 - 1` when `p1 - x > p2 - y`.
