Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `p1` and `p2` are integers entered by the user.
   - `p3` is an odd number and at least 3.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `_` is 2.
   - `x` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1`, and it is now `y - 1`.
   - `y + 1` must be greater than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Determine the Value of `y`:**
   - Since `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1`, and it is now `y - 1`, let's consider both cases:
     - If `y = p3 - 1`, then `y - 1 = p3 - 2`.
     - If `y = p3`, then `y - 1 = p3 - 1`.

   Given that `y` is now `y - 1`, we need to determine which case fits the condition that `y + 1` must be greater than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `y` is derived from `p3` and `p3` is an odd number at least 3, `p3 - 1` is always valid and satisfies the conditions.

   Therefore, `y = p3 - 1`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`.
   - We know `p3` is an odd number at least 3, so `p3 - 1` is also an even number and at least 2.
   - `x` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Given these details, the expression `p1 - x + p3` will evaluate to a specific value depending on the values of `p1` and `x`. However, since the exact values of `p1` and `x` are not specified, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p3 is an odd number at least 3 and x is either 0, 1, 2, or 3)**
