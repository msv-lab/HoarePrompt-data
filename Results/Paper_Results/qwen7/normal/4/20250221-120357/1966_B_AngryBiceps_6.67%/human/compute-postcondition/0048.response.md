Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to -1.
- `n` is the final length of the list `a`, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `a` is a list of lists containing user inputs.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.

The key point is that `first_row` consists of identical elements, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
