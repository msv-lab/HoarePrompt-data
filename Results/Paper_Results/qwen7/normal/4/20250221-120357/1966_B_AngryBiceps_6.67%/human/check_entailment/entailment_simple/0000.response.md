Reasoning:
The given solution attempts to solve the problem by checking if the first and last rows of the grid are different from the first row of the entire grid. This logic is flawed because it does not fully capture the conditions under which all squares can be made the same color. Specifically:

1. **Checking First and Last Rows**: The code checks if the first and last rows are different from the first row of the entire grid. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine whether all squares can be made the same color. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are the same but differ from other rows. This scenario would incorrectly return "YES".

2. **Grid Consistency**: The solution should check if there exists at least one row or column that is consistent throughout the grid. If all rows are the same, or all columns are the same, then it is possible to make all squares the same color. The current implementation does not correctly handle this consistency check.

3. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve checking if all rows or all columns are the same. If either all rows or all columns are identical, then it is possible to make all squares the same color. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
