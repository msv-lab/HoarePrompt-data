Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the last element of the last element in the list `a`. Since `a` contains only one element which is a list (input from the user), `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last element of that single element. The other variables remain unchanged.
