Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `_` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ _ ≤ 10^4; `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user; `first_row` is updated to include the first element of the only list in `a`; `last_row` is the last element of the only list in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user; `first_row` is the first element of that input; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user; `first_row` is the sum of the original first element of the input and the first element of the only list in `a`; `last_row` is increased by the last element of the only list in `a` plus the last element of the only list in `a`; `i` is 1; `n` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
