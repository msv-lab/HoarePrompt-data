State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. **Adjust Initial States**:
   - `i` is initially set to -1, but the loop will start with `i` being 0 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The initial values of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` do not affect the loop's execution condition directly, so they remain as given.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `n` is greater than 0 while keeping the other variables in their initial states.
