Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The program checks only the first row and the last row, as well as the first and last elements of each row, to determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not consider the entire subrectangle formed by selecting any two squares of the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
2 3
BBW
WBB
```

According to the problem description, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (2, 1), changing the grid to:
   ```
   BBW
   BBB
   ```
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (2, 2), changing the grid to:
   ```
   BBB
   BBB
   ```

However, the provided program would incorrectly output "NO" for this grid because the first and last rows and columns do not match. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
