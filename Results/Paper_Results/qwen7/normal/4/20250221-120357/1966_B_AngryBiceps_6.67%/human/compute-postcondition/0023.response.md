Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list containing all the inputs provided by the user, with each input as a separate element.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a`.
- The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- The first element of `a` does not consist of all the same characters.
- The first and last elements of `a` are the same.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1, meaning all characters in `first_row` are the same.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given this information, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
