Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is the new length of the list `a`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Check the initial values**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1`, the loop will start with `i` being `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` initially.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Given that `i` is set to `n-1`, the loop will start with `i` being `n-1`.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0 (since `i` is `n-1`, if `n` is 1 or more, `i` will be 0 or more).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
