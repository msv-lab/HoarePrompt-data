Output State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user; `first_row` is the first element of that input.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` assumes that `a` is a list containing a single sublist (which itself contains one element since `a` only has one element). The `-1` index accesses the last (and only) sublist in `a`, and `[0]` accesses the first (and only) element in that sublist. This element is then added to `first_row`. Since `a` initially contains a single element (the input from the user), `a[-1][0]` is simply that single element. Therefore, `first_row` is updated to be the value of that element.
