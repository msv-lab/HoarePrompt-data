Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string**.

The code `a.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending the input, `a` now contains one element which is the user's input. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `first_row`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged.
