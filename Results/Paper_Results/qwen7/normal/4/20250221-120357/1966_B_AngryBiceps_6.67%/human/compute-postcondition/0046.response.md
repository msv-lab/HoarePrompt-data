Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be -1, `n` will be the final length of the list `a`, `a` will contain all the inputs provided by the user, `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first elements of each list in `a`, and `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last elements of each list in `a`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have gone through all possible values from `n-1` down to 0, making it -1. The list `a` will have been populated with all the inputs provided by the user. The string `first_row` will consist of the first characters of each list in `a`, concatenated together, and `last_row` will consist of the last characters of each list in `a`, also concatenated together.
