Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines representing the grid, storing each line in the list `a`.

2. **Processing the Grid:**
   - It constructs `first_row` by taking the first character from each row.
   - It constructs `last_row` by taking the last character from each row.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the first row (`a[0]`) is uniform but different from the last row (`a[-1]`). If this condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - Similarly, it checks if the first column (`first_row`) is uniform but different from the last column (`last_row`). If this condition is true, it also prints "NO".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

#### Condition 1: `a[0]` is uniform but different from `a[-1]`
- This condition checks if the first row is entirely one color but different from the last row. If this happens, it means there is no way to make the entire grid one color using the allowed operations because the first and last rows are different and uniform.

#### Condition 2: `first_row` is uniform but different from `last_row`
- This condition checks if the first column is entirely one color but different from the last column. Similar to the first condition, if this happens, it means there is no way to make the entire grid one color using the allowed operations because the first and last columns are different and uniform.

#### General Case: Both Conditions Fail
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that either the entire grid is uniform or there is a way to make it uniform through the allowed operations. Hence, the program prints "YES".

### Conclusion

The program correctly identifies when it is impossible to make all squares the same color by checking if the first and last rows or columns are uniform and different. If such a situation is detected, it correctly outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Thus, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
