Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `n`, `data`, or `dic`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `check` is updated to its new value.
