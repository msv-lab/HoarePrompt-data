Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in data`. The variables involved here are `i` and `data`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` will take the value of each element in the list `data` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `data` must contain at least one element. If `data` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `data` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that `data` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `data` when the loop starts its first iteration.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `data` is not empty and `i` is set to the first element of `data`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`**
