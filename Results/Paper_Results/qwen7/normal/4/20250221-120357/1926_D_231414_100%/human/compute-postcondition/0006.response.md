Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `data`, or `dic`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while updating `ans` to 0.
