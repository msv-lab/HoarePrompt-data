Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is either `a[4]` or `a[3] + 0` depending on the conditions, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 4`, `ii` is 4, `a` is a list of integers created from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in the variable `a`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `r`, `k`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
