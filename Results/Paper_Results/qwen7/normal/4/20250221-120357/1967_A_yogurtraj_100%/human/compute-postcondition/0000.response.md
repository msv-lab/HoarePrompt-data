Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ii in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved here are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `ii` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 in the first iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` is the number of test cases, which we need to determine.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `ii < int(input())`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `ii` starts from 0, the loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. We need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the given initial state**: The initial state is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means `t` could be any value between 1 and 100. However, this does not directly affect the loop condition since `t` is not used in the loop itself.

Given the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
