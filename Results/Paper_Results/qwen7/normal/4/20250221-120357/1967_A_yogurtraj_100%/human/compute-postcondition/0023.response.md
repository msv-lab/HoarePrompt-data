Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2] + 0`, `y` is `n - 2 - 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. Since `rem` is calculated as `k % 3`, and now `k` is `0`, `rem` also becomes `0`. Similarly, `r` is calculated as `a[2] + k // 3`, and since `k` is now `0`, `r` becomes `a[2] + 0`, which simplifies to `a[2]`. Lastly, `y` is calculated as `n - 2 - i`, and since `i` is `2`, `y` becomes `n - 2 - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
