### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list `a` of size `n`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted, which is a necessary step to facilitate the subsequent calculations.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `r` is initialized to the minimum value in `a`.
   - `rem` is used to store the remaining budget after purchasing cards.
   - `y` is used to count the number of additional cards that can be added after the main loop.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `a` to determine how many cards can be bought to maximize the score.
   - If the remaining budget `k` cannot buy enough cards to increase the current value of `r` by 1, the program calculates the new value of `r`, the remaining budget `rem`, and the number of additional cards `y` that can be added.
   - Otherwise, it continues to update `k` and `r`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After the loop, if any budget remains (`k != 0`), it adjusts `r` and calculates the final score.
   - If no budget remains, it uses the previously calculated `r`, `rem`, and `y` to calculate the final score.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly identifies the minimum value in the sorted list `a` and updates it based on the remaining budget `k`.
- The logic for determining the number of additional cards that can be added (`y`) and the remaining budget (`rem`) is sound.
- The final score calculation is based on the adjusted value of `r`, `rem`, and `y`, which ensures that the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` is achieved.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given examples.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score based on the given constraints and examples.
