Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `r` is either `a[4]` or `a[3] + 0` depending on the conditions. Since no specific condition is mentioned, we need to consider both possibilities.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is `n - 1 - 3`, which simplifies to `n - 4`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The expression to be printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.
   - Given `rem` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(r - 1) * n + 1 + y`.
   - Substituting `y` with `n - 4`, the expression further simplifies to `(r - 1) * n + 1 + (n - 4)`, which is `(r - 1) * n + n - 3`.

3. **Possible Values for `r`:**
   - `r` could be `a[4]` or `a[3] + 0` (which simplifies to `a[3]`).
   - Without knowing the exact values of `a[3]` and `a[4]`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `r = a[4]`, then the expression becomes `(a[4] - 1) * n + n - 3`.
     - If `r = a[3]`, then the expression becomes `(a[3] - 1) * n + n - 3`.

Since the exact values of `a[3]` and `a[4]` are not provided, we will keep them in their symbolic form.

Output: **(a[4] - 1) * n + n - 3** if `r = a[4]`, or **(a[3] - 1) * n + n - 3** if `r = a[3]`.
