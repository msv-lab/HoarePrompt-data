Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `r` is equal to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is equal to `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is equal to `n - 1 - i`, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `r`, `rem`, or `y`. The value of `r` simplifies to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)` because `0 // (i + 1)` is `0`. Similarly, `rem` becomes `0 % (i + 1)`, which is `0`. The value of `y` remains unchanged as `n - 1 - i`.
