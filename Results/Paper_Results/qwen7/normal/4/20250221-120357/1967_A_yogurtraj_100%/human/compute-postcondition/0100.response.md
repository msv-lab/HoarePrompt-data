Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `i` is the loop variable, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop `for i in range(0, n - 1)` will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. This means that the loop will run for `n - 1` iterations.

4. **Initial State:**
   - `y` is 0.
   - `ii` is `m`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `r` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `rem` is 0.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue running until `i < n - 1`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0, so the loop will start executing if `n > 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
