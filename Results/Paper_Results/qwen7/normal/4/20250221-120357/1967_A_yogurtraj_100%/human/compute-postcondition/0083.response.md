Output State: **`k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The values of `k` and `i` are updated according to the initial state, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`. The condition that `n` is greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged as no operation affects `n`.
