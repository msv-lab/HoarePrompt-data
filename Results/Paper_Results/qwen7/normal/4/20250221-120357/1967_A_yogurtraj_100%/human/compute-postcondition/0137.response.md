Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `r` is `a[1]`. Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `r`, but it is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `y` is `n - 1`. Here, `n` is not explicitly defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `y`, but it is `n - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `r` is `a[1]`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is `n - 1`.

Substituting these into the print statement:
```python
print((a[1] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + (n - 1))
```

Simplifying the expression:
```python
print((a[1] - 1) * n + 1 + n - 1)
```

Further simplification:
```python
print((a[1] - 1) * n + n)
```

Combining like terms:
```python
print(a[1] * n - n + n)
```

The `- n + n` terms cancel out:
```python
print(a[1] * n)
```

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of the second element of the list `a` and `n`.

Output: **a[1] * n (where a[1] is the second element of the list a and n is the value of n)**
