Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`. This means `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `k` is either 0 or has been fully decremented according to the loop conditions but is not 0. So, `k` is a non-zero integer.
   - `r` is defined as `a[n-1] + k // n`. Here, `a[n-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, and `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The expression to be printed is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

Let's substitute the value of `r` into the expression:
\[ r = a[n-1] + \frac{k}{n} \]

So, the expression becomes:
\[ (a[n-1] + \frac{k}{n} - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n \]

Simplifying further:
\[ (a[n-1] + \frac{k}{n} - 1) * n + 1 + k \% n = a[n-1] * n + \frac{k}{n} * n - n + 1 + k \% n \]
\[ = a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 + k \% n \]

Since `k % n` gives the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`, it is a value between 0 and `n-1`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[ a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 + k \% n \]

Given that `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`, it can be expressed as `k - (k // n) * n`. Substituting this back, we get:
\[ a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 + k - (k // n) * n \]
\[ = a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 + k - k + n \]
\[ = a[n-1] * n + 1 \]

Therefore, the print statement will output:
\[ a[n-1] * n + 1 \]

Output: **a[n-1] * n + 1**
