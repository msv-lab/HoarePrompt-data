Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 4`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `k` was set such that `rem = k % 3`. After setting `k = 0`, `rem` becomes `0 % 3 = 0`.
- The value of `r` was previously `a[2] + k // 3`. With `k` now being `0`, `r` simplifies to `a[2] + 0 // 3`, which is just `a[2]`.
- The values of `i` and `y` remain unchanged because they were not directly affected by the assignment `k = 0`.
