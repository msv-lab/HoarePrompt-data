Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the variables `i`, `k`, `rem`, `r`, and `y` retain their initial values. The `break` statement does not change these values but indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside.
