Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `y` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Since `k` is not 0 (as per the precondition), `k // n` will be the integer division of `k` by `n`. The values of `i`, `k`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
