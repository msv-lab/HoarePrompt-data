Output State: **`k` is 0, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `r` is equal to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is directly assigned the value `0`. All other variables (`rem`, `r`, `i`, `n`, `y`) remain unchanged from their previous values, except that `k` now holds the value `0`. The expression for `rem` simplifies to `0 % (i + 1)` since `k` is now `0`. Similarly, the expression for `r` simplifies to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, which further simplifies to `a[i]` because `0 // (i + 1)` is `0`. The increments and conditions involving `i` and `n` remain the same.
