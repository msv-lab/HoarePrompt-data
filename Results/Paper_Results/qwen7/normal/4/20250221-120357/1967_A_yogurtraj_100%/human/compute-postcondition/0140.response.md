Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case within `t`, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, along with a list `a` containing `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.**

This means the function `func` takes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then performs some operation based on these inputs and returns a result.
