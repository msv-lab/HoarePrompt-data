Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 4, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 27, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` was initially 3, `i + 1` is 4 and `2 * i + 1` is 7. Therefore, `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` equals `4 * 7`, which is 28. Adding 28 to the initial value of `res`, which was 9, results in `res` being 27. The values of `total`, `t`, `mat`, and `n` remain unchanged.
