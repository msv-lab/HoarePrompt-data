Based on the initial state and the provided information:

- `res` is 81.
- `n` is greater than 9.
- The expression `n << 1` shifts `n` left by 1 bit, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2.

Given that `n` must be greater than 9 and considering the context of the problem, the smallest possible value for `n` that fits the pattern and the constraints is 10 (as derived from the pattern analysis). 

Therefore, `n << 1` will be `10 * 2 = 20`.

So, the print statement will output the values of `res` and `n << 1`.

Output: **81, 20**
