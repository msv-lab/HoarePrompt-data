Output State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `mat`). Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged, and `res` is set to 0.
