Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 360
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `i` is 4
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`
   - `res` is 27
   - `n` must be greater than 3

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - Since `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than 5 to allow another iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 5, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 27, `n` must be greater than 5**
