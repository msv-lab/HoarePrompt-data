Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 360 (though this is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (also not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 10.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n` (the value of `n` is not explicitly given but must be greater than or equal to 10).
- `res` is 81 (though this is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`, which is 10. So, it becomes `'2 10'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into separate arguments, starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 10, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string that starts with `'2 10'` followed by all integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 [all integers from 10 to n]**
