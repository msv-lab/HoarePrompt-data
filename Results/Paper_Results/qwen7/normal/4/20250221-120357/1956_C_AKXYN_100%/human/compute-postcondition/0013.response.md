Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n` and decrements until it reaches `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `res` is 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute with the given conditions. Since the loop starts with `i` set to `n-1`, we need to confirm that `n` is indeed greater than 2, and `i` is correctly initialized to `n-1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` should be `n-1`.
2. **Value of `n`**: The loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Given that `i` starts at `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to start. However, since the problem specifies `n` must be greater than 2, `n` must be at least 3.
3. **Other Variables**: The variables `res`, `t`, and `students_list` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need adjustment based on the loop itself.

### Final State Adjustment:

Since the loop starts with `i` set to `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop condition.

**State:**
- `res` is 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` must be greater than 2 and `i` is equal to `n-1`.

Thus, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 2 and `i` is equal to `n-1**.
