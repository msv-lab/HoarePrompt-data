Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified. For the sake of the print statement, let's assume `n` is 3 (the smallest value greater than 2).
- `i` is equal to `n - 1`, so if `n` is 3, then `i` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Breaking it down:
- `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`, which is 2. So, this part becomes `'2 2'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` expands the range object into arguments, so if `n` is 3, it becomes `1 2 3`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 2 1 2 3**
