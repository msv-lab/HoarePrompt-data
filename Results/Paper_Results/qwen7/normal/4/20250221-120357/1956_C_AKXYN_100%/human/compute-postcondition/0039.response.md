Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 360
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `i` is `n`
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 4

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `n` to 1 (inclusive) with a step of -1. This means `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n` and decreases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `total` remains 360.
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `i` is now `n-1`.
   - `mat` remains the same list of lists.
   - `n` remains greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is `n-1`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4**
