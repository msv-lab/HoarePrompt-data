Based on the initial state provided, we know that `res` is 140. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is equal to `n-1`. Since `res` is already calculated to be 140, the loop has completed its iterations, and `n` is set to 3 (as `i` is 2, which means `n-1` is 2, so `n` is 3).

The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the bits of `n` to the left by 1 position. Shifting `n` (which is 3) to the left by 1 position results in `n * 2`, which is 6.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `res` followed by the result of `n << 1`.

Output: **140, 6**
