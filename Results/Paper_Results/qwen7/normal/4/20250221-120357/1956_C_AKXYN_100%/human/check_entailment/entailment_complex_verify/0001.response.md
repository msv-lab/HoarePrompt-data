### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
   - The provided solution initializes the matrix such that each row and column is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The code initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). Specifically, `mat[i] = list(range(1, n + 1))` for each row \( i \).
   - This means that the matrix is filled with the identity permutation for each row.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of the matrix elements is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \).
   - This sum is derived from the fact that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to \( j \), resulting in a triangular sum pattern.

4. **Operations**:
   - The code performs \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each setting the row or column to a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - Specifically, for each row \( i \), it prints:
     ```python
     print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - And for each column \( i \), it prints:
     ```python
     print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```

5. **Number of Operations**:
   - The code performs exactly \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, totaling \( 2n \) operations, which satisfies the problem constraints.

6. **Verification**:
   - The sum calculation is correct and matches the problem's requirement.
   - The operations are performed in such a way that they ensure the matrix is filled with the desired permutations.
   - The number of operations is exactly \( 2n \), meeting the problem's limit.

Given these points, the provided solution is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
