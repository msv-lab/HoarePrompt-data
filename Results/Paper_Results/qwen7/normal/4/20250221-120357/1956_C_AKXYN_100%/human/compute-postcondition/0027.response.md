Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will run until `i` reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop will continue as long as `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `res` is 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is equal to 1.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.

We need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `i`, and `mat`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `n` must be greater than 1.

The final answer is:
**State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1**.
