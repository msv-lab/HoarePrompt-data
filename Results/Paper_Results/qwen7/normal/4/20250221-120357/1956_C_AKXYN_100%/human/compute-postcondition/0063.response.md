Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 360.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `i` is 9.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is 81.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of this print statement:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the string uses string formatting. Since `i` is 9, it will be formatted as `'1 9'`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function into separate arguments. The range starts from 1 and goes up to `n` (inclusive). Given that `n` must be at least 10, the range will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output:
```
1 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

Output: **1 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10**
