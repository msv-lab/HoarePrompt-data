Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 529, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10.**

### Explanation:
The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and adds the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`. Given the initial state and the pattern observed:

- After 1 iteration, `i` is 10 and `res` is 81.
- After 2 iterations, `i` is 9 and `res` is 145.
- After 3 iterations, `i` is 8 and `res` is 274.
- After 4 iterations, `i` is 7 and `res` is 408.
- After 5 iterations, `i` is 6 and `res` is 529.

Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, the final value of `i` will be 1. At this point, `res` will be 529, as calculated from the sum of the series up to `i = 10`.

The other variables (`total`, `t`, `mat`, and `n`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
