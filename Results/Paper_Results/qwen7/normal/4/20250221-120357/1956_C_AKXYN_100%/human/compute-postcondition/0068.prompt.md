Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 10, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than 9.

To understand this output state, let's analyze the loop and its behavior:

The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and adds the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration, `res` is 9 when `i` is 2, implying that `n > 1`.
- After 2 iterations, `res` is 27 when `i` is 4, implying that `n > 3`.
- After 3 iterations, `res` is 39 when `i` is 6, implying that `n > 5`.

We can see that `i` increases by 2 with each iteration. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `i` would be 8, after 5 iterations, `i` would be 10, and so on.

Let's calculate `res` after all iterations:
- For `i = 2`: \( (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15 \)
- For `i = 4`: \( (4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 5 * 9 = 45 \)
- For `i = 6`: \( (6 + 1) * (2 * 6 + 1) = 7 * 13 = 91 \)

Summing these up: \( 9 + 45 + 91 = 145 \).

Continuing the pattern:
- For `i = 8`: \( (8 + 1) * (2 * 8 + 1) = 9 * 17 = 153 \)
- For `i = 10`: \( (10 + 1) * (2 * 10 + 1) = 11 * 21 = 231 \)

Summing these up: \( 145 + 153 + 231 = 529 \).

However, we need to consider the correct sum for `res` after all iterations. Given the pattern and the problem constraints, the final value of `res` should be calculated as follows:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) * (2i + 1) \]

For `n = 10`:
\[ 3*5 + 5*9 + 7*13 + 9*17 + 11*21 + 13*25 + 15*29 + 17*33 + 19*37 + 21*41 = 81 \]

Thus, after all iterations, `i` will be 10, and `res` will be 81, with `n` being greater than 9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 10, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 9, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 8, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
