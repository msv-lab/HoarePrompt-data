Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**: From the problem statement, we know that `i` is initially `n+1` and `n` must be greater than 4. However, the loop starts with `i` in the range from `n` to 0 (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(n, 0, -1)`. This means `i` should be equal to `n` at the start of the loop.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is set to `n` and `n` is greater than 4.

**Final State**:
- `i` should be set to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is `n`, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4**.
