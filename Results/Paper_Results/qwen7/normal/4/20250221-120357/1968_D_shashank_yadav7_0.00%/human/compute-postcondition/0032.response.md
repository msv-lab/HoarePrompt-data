Output State: **`i` is -1, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increases the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. The other variables (`i`, `p[b]`, `s`, `sm`, `bm`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
