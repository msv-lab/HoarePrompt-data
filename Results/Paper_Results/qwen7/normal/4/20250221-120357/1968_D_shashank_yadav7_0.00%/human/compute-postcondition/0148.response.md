Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions**: 
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

4. **Update the Values**:
   - Initially, `i` is less than `n`.
   - After the loop completes one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new condition will be `(i + 1) < n`.

5. **Final State**:
   - The only variables that change due to the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`.**

However, since only the loop head variables (`i` and `n`) can be adjusted, the updated state for these variables is:

**State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n`**.

So, the final answer is:

**State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n`**.
