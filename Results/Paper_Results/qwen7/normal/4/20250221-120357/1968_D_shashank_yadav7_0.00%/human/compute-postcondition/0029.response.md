Output State: **`i` is -1, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to be `p[s] - 1`. The initial state shows that `p[b]` is decreased by 1, which means `p[b]` was already decremented before this line of code. The value of `i` remains -1, and the value of `n` remains a positive integer, but since `n` is not directly involved in the current operation, its exact value is not specified in the output state.
