Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values and conditions**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 and now needs to be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Since the other variables (`k`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, `bm`, and `p`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
