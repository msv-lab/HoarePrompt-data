Output State: **`bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sm` is increased by the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increases the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
