Output State: **`i` is -1, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding the maximum value between its current value (`sm`) and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. The other variables (`i`, `p[b]`, `s`, `bm`, and `a[b] * k + bp`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
