Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration. Since it was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous value.
   - `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is -1
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2 - 1`
- `bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
- `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`
- `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`
- `i` is less than `n`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`
- `n` remains the same

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`.**
