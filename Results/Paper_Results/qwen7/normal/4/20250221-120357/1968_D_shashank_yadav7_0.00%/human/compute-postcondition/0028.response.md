Output State: **`i` is -1, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `n` remains a positive integer.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b]` minus 1. Since `i` was already -1 and the condition to break out of the loop or if statement when `k == 0` is not relevant here, `i` remains unchanged. The value of `n` remains a positive integer as no operation affects it. The value of `p[b]` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
