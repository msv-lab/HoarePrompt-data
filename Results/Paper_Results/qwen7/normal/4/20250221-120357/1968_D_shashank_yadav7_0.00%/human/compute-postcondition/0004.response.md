Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
