Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm` plus the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is `sm` plus the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, and `a` remain unchanged from their previous values except for `k` which is decreased by 1, and `b` and `s` which are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. `bm` is updated to its previous value plus the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.
