Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. Therefore, `sm` and `bm` are updated based on the new value of `sp`.
