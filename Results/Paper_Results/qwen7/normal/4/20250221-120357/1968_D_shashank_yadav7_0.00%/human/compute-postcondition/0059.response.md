Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `b` and `s` are updated as described by the input, `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration, both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` over the input string split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a list `a` from these integers. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
