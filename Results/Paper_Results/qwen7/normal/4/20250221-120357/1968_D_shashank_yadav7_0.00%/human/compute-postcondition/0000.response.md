Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other variables (n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a) remain in their initial state.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, while all other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) retain their initial unspecified values.
