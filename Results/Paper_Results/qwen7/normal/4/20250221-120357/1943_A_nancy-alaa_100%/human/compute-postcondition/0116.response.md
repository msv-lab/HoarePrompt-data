Given the initial state:
- `first` is `True`
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(i)` executes.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is defined as `n + 2`. Since `n` is an input integer, `i` will be `n + 2`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i`, which is `n + 2`.

Output: **n + 2**
