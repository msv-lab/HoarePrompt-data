Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The values of `first`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
