Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`. The current value of `mpp[i]` is 1.**

The variable `first` is initialized to `True`, which does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `arr`, or `mpp`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
