Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `first` is false (since it was not set to true in the previous iteration)
   - `i` is not in `mpp.keys()` (since `i` was 1 and it was not in `mpp.keys()` in the previous iteration)
   - `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 (since `i` was 1 and `mpp[i]` was not 1 in the previous iteration)

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n` inclusive.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `first` remains false unless it is explicitly set to true within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes 2
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1
- `first` remains false

So, the updated state is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `first` is false**
