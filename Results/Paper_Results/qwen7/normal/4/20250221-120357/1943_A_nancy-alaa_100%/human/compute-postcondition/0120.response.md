Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `True`.
- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `n + 2`.

Output: **n + 2**
