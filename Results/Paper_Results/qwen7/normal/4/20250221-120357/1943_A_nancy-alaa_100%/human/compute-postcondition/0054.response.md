Output State: **`i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `i`, which remains 0. It only indicates that the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no other variables are affected, the precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 and the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` remains valid.
