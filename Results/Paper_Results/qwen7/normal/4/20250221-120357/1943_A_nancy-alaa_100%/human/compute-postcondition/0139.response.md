Output State: `first` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will decrement from `n + 1` to `0` because the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive. The variable `first` remains `False` because it was set to `True` only once when `i` was `n + 1`, and no subsequent conditions in the loop changed its value. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
