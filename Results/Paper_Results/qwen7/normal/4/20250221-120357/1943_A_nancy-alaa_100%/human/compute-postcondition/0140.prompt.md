Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `first` is False, `i` is 3, and `n` is an input integer. The value of `i` has incremented to 3 after the loop has completed all its iterations. Since `first` was never set to True within the loop, it remains False. The variable `t` from the initial state is not affected by the loop and thus retains its original value. The variable `arr` and `mpp` (Counter object) also remain unchanged from their initial states.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `n` + 1, `first` retains its original value, `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` and `mpp` also retain their original values.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment to `n + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive. The value of `first` remains unchanged as it is only modified inside the loop under specific conditions that do not necessarily apply every time through the loop. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not altered within the loop and thus retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `first` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will decrement from `n + 1` to `0` because the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive. The variable `first` remains `False` because it was set to `True` only once when `i` was `n + 1`, and no subsequent conditions in the loop changed its value. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
