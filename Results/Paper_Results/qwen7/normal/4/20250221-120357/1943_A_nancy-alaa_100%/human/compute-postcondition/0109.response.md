Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 or `first` is false, we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
