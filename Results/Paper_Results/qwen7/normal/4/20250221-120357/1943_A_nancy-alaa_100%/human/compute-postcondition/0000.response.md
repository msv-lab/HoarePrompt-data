Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, typically representing the current iteration count.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as the expression inside `range()` evaluates to a non-zero value. In this case, the expression is `int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and doesn't hold any specific value; it simply increments with each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), we can assume that the input will always be within this range, ensuring the loop will execute.

Given the above points, the only state that needs adjustment is the input itself, which should be a positive integer.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

Since the loop will execute for each test case, and each test case is defined by the input, the initial state of `t` ensures that the loop will run for each valid test case.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**.
