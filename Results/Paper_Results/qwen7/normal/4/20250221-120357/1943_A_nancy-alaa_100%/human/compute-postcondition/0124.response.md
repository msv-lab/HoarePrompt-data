Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `first = True` simply sets the variable `first` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
