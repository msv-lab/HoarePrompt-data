Output State: `i` is equal to `n` + 1, `first` retains its original value, `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` and `mpp` also retain their original values.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment to `n + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive. The value of `first` remains unchanged as it is only modified inside the loop under specific conditions that do not necessarily apply every time through the loop. The variables `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are not altered within the loop and thus retain their initial values.
