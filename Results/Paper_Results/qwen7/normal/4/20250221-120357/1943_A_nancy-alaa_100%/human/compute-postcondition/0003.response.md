Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each integer in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
