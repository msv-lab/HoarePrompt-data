Output State: **`first` is `True`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code sets `first` to `True`. This changes the value of `first` from its previous state (`False`). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
