The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it identifies the smallest missing integer in the list or the first unique integer (if all integers are present). If a missing integer is found, it prints the smallest one; otherwise, it prints the first unique integer. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
