Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list (starting from index 0).
   - Finally, it prints the list.

Now, let's check if this approach satisfies the problem requirements:

- **Problem Requirement**: We need a permutation \( p \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

- **Generated Permutation**: The permutation generated by the program looks like this:
  - For \( n = 4 \), the permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - For \( n = 3 \), the permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`.

- **Verification**:
  - For \( n = 4 \):
    - Check pairs: 
      - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \), \( p_3 = 2 \), or \( p_4 = 3 \).
      - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \) or \( p_4 = 3 \).
      - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
    - This permutation is valid.
  - For \( n = 3 \):
    - Check pairs:
      - \( p_1 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \) or \( p_3 = 2 \).
      - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
    - This permutation is valid.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements for the provided examples.

**Conclusion**:
Correctness: **True**
