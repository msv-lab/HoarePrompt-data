Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and constructs a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`. It then reverses every second element in the list and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value but prints the final state of the list for each test case.**
