Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a positive integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. The function returns a result based on the value of `n` and `t` for each test case. If the sum of all `n` values across all test cases exceeds 10^5, an error is returned.**
