### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary against the problem requirements.

1. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list (starting from index 0).
   - Finally, it prints the list.

2. **Generated Permutation Analysis**:
   - For \( n = 4 \), the permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`.

3. **Verification Against Problem Requirements**:
   - The requirement is to find a permutation \( p \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

4. **Checking the Generated Permutations**:
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - Pairs to check: `(4, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, `(3, 4)`
     - `4` does not divide `1`, `1` does not divide `2`, `2` does not divide `3`, `3` does not divide `4`.
     - This permutation is valid.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - Pairs to check: `(3, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`
     - `3` does not divide `1`, `1` does not divide `2`, `2` does not divide `3`.
     - This permutation is valid.

5. **General Case Verification**:
   - Let's consider the general case for any \( n \). The permutation generated by the program is:
     - `[n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1]` for even \( n \)
     - `[n, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1]` for odd \( n \)

   - For any pair \((p_i, p_{i+1})\):
     - If \( p_i \) is even, \( p_{i+1} \) will be odd (since the sequence alternates between even and odd numbers).
     - If \( p_i \) is odd, \( p_{i+1} \) will be even.
     - Since no even number divides an odd number, the condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements for all test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
