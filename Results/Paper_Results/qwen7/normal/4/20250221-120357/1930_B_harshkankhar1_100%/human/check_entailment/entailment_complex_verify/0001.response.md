### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list (starting from index 0).
   - Finally, it prints the list.

3. **Verification**:
   - The key requirement is to generate a permutation \( p \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

#### Analysis of the Generated Permutation

- **For \( n = 4 \)**:
  - The generated permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - Checking pairs:
    - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \), \( p_3 = 2 \), or \( p_4 = 3 \).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \) or \( p_4 = 3 \).
    - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
  - This permutation is valid.

- **For \( n = 3 \)**:
  - The generated permutation is `[3, 1, 2]`.
  - Checking pairs:
    - \( p_1 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \) or \( p_3 = 2 \).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
  - This permutation is valid.

However, let's consider a more general case to ensure the solution works for all \( n \):

- **General Case**:
  - Consider \( n = 6 \): The generated permutation is `[6, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3]`.
  - Checking pairs:
    - \( p_1 = 6 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \), \( p_3 = 4 \), \( p_4 = 2 \), \( p_5 = 5 \), or \( p_6 = 3 \).
    - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 4 \), \( p_4 = 2 \), \( p_5 = 5 \), or \( p_6 = 3 \).
    - \( p_3 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 2 \), \( p_5 = 5 \), or \( p_6 = 3 \).
    - \( p_4 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 5 \) or \( p_6 = 3 \).
    - \( p_5 = 5 \) does not divide \( p_6 = 3 \).
  - This permutation is valid.

But, let's consider another permutation for \( n = 6 \):
- **Alternative Permutation**: `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
  - Checking pairs:
    - \( p_1 = 6 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 5 \), \( p_3 = 4 \), \( p_4 = 3 \), \( p_5 = 2 \), or \( p_6 = 1 \).
    - \( p_2 = 5 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 4 \), \( p_4 = 3 \), \( p_5 = 2 \), or \( p_6 = 1 \).
    - \( p_3 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \), \( p_5 = 2 \), or \( p_6 = 1 \).
    - \( p_4 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_5 = 2 \) or \( p_6 = 1 \).
    - \( p_5 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_6 = 1 \).
  - This permutation is also valid.

The key issue is that the program only generates one specific type of permutation (reversing every other element). While this works for small values of \( n \), it might not cover all possible valid permutations for larger \( n \). Therefore, the program does not guarantee that it will always find a valid permutation for any \( n \).

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the generated permutation will always satisfy the problem's requirements for all \( n \). The program only generates a specific type of permutation, which may not cover all valid permutations for larger \( n \).

**Final: False**
