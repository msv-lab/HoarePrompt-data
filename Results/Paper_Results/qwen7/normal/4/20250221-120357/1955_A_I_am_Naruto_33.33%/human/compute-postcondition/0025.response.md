Postcondition: `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `new_t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n` if `n > 1`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n > 1`, otherwise `ans2` remains unchanged.
