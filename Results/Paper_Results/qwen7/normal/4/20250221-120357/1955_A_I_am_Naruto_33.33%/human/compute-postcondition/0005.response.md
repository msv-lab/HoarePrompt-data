Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but it does not affect the calculation of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `n` is greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

The `print(min(ans1, ans2))` statement will print the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, the output will be expressed in terms of these variables.
