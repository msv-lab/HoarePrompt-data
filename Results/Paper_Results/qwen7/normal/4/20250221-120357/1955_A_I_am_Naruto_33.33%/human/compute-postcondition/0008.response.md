Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, and `b` is the third integer input. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the values of `ans1` and `ans2` are not specified.
