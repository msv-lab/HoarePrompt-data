Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
