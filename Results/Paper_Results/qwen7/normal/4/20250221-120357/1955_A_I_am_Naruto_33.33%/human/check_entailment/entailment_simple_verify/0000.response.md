### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation of Costs:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: Cost if each yogurt is bought individually.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: Cost if yogurts are bought in pairs under the promotion, with any remaining single yogurt bought at the individual price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `a` since there's no promotion applicable.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations indicate that the program iterates through all test cases and calculates the minimum cost for each test case.
   - The final state after the loop is consistent with the input constraints.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than half the single price `a`. It claims that in such cases, it is always cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at price `a`.

#### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \( b < \frac{a}{2} \)**
     - For example, consider \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 10 \).
     - `ans1 = a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2 = 10 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 15 + 5 = 20`.
     - The program outputs `min(15, 20) = 15`, which is correct.
   - **Case 2: \( b \geq \frac{a}{2} \)**
     - For example, consider \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 6 \).
     - `ans1 = a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2 = 6 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - The program outputs `min(15, 14) = 14`, which is also correct.

2. **General Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles both scenarios:
     - When `b < a/2`, it avoids the promotion and buys all yogurts individually.
     - When `b >= a/2`, it uses the promotion to minimize the cost.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case, handling both scenarios where the promotion is beneficial and where it is not. The original assessment was incorrect because it incorrectly claimed that the program fails when `b < a/2`. The program actually handles this case correctly by avoiding the promotion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
