Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers t, n, and a, and a separate integer b for each test case where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. It returns a result based on the values of n, a, and b for each test case.**

This means the function indirectly accepts multiple sets of parameters (t, n, a, b) and processes them to produce a result for each test case, with t indicating the number of test cases.
