Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `new_t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * n` to `ans1`. Since the condition `n > 1` is not specified to change the value of `ans1`, and `ans2` is only updated if `n > 1`, which is not the case here, `ans2` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
