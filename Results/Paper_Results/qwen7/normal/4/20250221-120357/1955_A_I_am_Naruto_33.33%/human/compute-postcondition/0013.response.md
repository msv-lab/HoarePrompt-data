Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial states. `ans2` is now determined based on the given formula using the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
