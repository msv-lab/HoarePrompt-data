Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input()))`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will run once for each integer input provided by the user. Each iteration does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` directly, but it increments the number of iterations.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**: Since the loop head involves taking an input, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the input provided.

Given the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer input
- `a` is the second integer input
- `b` is the third integer input

For the loop to execute one more time, the user needs to provide another integer input. Let's denote this new input as `new_input`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` remains the same (since it's not used in the loop)
- `n` remains the same (since it's not used in the loop)
- `a` remains the same (since it's not used in the loop)
- `b` remains the same (since it's not used in the loop)

The only thing that changes is the number of iterations, which is determined by the new input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, and the loop will run one more time based on the new input provided by the user.**
