Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is an integer input by the user, `b` is an integer input by the user, `new_t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans2` to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `new_t`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
