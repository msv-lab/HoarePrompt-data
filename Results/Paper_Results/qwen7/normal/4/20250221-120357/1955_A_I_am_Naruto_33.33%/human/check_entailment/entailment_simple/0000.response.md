Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts without any promotion (`ans1 = a * n`).
4. If `n` is greater than 1, it also calculates the cost with the promotion (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`), which accounts for buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price.
5. It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
6. The logic handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by simply printing `a`.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
