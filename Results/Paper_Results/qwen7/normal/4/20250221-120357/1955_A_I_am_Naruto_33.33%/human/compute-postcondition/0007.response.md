Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- `n` is less than or equal to 1.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of the variable `a`.

Output: **a (where a is the second integer input)**
