Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**

Explanation:
- `n` is an integer input by the user.
- `a` is an integer input by the user.
- `b` is an integer input by the user.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

The `print` statement will output the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`. Since the actual values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, the output will be expressed in terms of these variables.
