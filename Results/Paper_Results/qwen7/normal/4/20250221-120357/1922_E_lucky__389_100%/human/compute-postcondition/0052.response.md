Output State: `mx` is either 4 or 6, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be 4, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3] or [3, 4], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed to reach the condition where `2 ** i > x`.

**Explanation:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be incremented until `2 ** i` exceeds the value of `x`. Given that the final state after 3 iterations shows `i` as 4, it implies that `2 ** 4 = 16` is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than `x`, which must be 4 in this case (since it's the only value `x` can take based on the given conditions). Therefore, `i` will be incremented beyond 4, but the exact final value of `i` depends on the specific value of `x` and the loop's termination condition. However, we can conclude that `i` will be at least 5, as the loop continues until `2 ** i` is strictly greater than `x`.
