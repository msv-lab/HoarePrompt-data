Output State: **`mx` is either 4 or 6, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be 4, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3] or [3, 4], `i` is 4**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, and `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged.
