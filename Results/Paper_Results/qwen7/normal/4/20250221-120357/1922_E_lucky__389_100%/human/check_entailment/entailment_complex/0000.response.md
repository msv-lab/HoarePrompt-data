Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Base Case**: For \( x = 2 \), the function correctly outputs `1 0`, which is the expected output for a single increasing subsequence.
   - **General Case**: For other values of \( x \), the function uses a loop to decompose \( x \) into sums of distinct powers of 2. This is a valid approach to construct arrays with specific numbers of increasing subsequences.
   - **Constructing the Array**: The function constructs the array `ansv` by appending the lengths of the subsequences derived from the decomposition of \( x \). The logic to build the array seems correct, although there is a discrepancy in the final printed length and the actual content of `ansv`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the constructed array followed by the array elements. However, the length printed (`3`) does not match the actual length of `ansv` (`5`). This is a critical error in the output formatting.

Given the above points, the function logic is mostly correct in terms of constructing the array, but there is a significant issue with the output formatting.

Correctness: **False**
