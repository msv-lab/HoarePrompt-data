Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variable involved in the loop head is `i`.
3. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been increased by 1.
4. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must be true.

Given that `i` has been increased by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`. Therefore, the condition becomes `2 ** i_new <= x`.

Since `i` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `i` (let's call it `i_new`) is `i + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x` must hold true. This means that `2 ** i * 2 <= x` or `2 ** (i + 1) <= x`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that the loop condition remains valid for the next iteration.

**State:**
- `i` must be such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x`

So, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`i` must be such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x`**
