Output State: **`mx` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 4, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3, 4], `i` is 5**.

The code `subseq_lens.append(i - 1)` appends the value of `i - 1` (which is 4) to the list `subseq_lens`. Initially, `subseq_lens` contains `[3]`. After appending 4, `subseq_lens` becomes `[3, 4]`. The values of `mx`, `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
