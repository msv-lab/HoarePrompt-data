Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 8, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3], `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i - 1` (which is 3) to the list `subseq_lens`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `subseq_lens` now contains the element 3.
