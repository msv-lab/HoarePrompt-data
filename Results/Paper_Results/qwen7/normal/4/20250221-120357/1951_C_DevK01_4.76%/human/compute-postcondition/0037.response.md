Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is ceil(k / m) - 1, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is the ceiling value of k / m, `N` is a list containing the first q-1 elements of `M`, `mu` is k - (n - 1) * m, `cost` is mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cost` by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
