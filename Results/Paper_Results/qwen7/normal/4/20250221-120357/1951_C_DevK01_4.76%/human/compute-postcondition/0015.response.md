Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers entered by the user; `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string; `n` is the length of `L`; `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `q` is a value such that `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`; `w` is the last element of `N` before popping; `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `mu` has been calculated using the formula `k - (n - 1) * m`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
