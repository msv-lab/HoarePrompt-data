Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `n` is now equal to the length of list `N`, `w` is the last element of list `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cost`. Initially, `cost` was defined as `mu * w`. After executing the line `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `cost` is updated to include these additional terms. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
