To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formula for `cost`:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t > 1`: This is a condition but does not affect the calculation of `cost`.
   - `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `L`.
   - `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`.
   - `k` is the third element of `L`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`.
   - `n` is the number of elements in list `N`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, then `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where:
     - `w` is the last element of list `N` before popping.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

Given these definitions, we need to consider both cases for `cost`:

- **Case 1: `n * m == k`**
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
  
- **Case 2: `n * m != k`**
  - `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`
  - Here, `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`
  - And `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.

Since the exact values of `L`, `N`, `m`, `k`, `n`, and `w` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated cost according to the conditions described.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions: either m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m == k, or mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu if n * m != k, with mu = k - (n - 1) * m and w being the last element of N before popping)**
