Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers entered by the user; `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string; `n` is the length of `L`; `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `q` is a value such that `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`; `w` is the last element of `N` before popping; `cost` is calculated as `mu * w`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

In this state, the variable `cost` has been assigned the value of `mu * w`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
