Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased (`k`) is greater than the product of `m` and `n`. In such cases, the program assumes that `m` is the limiting factor and does not consider the possibility of purchasing tickets across multiple days beyond the initial `m` tickets per day.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 10 11
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Here, `n = 5`, `m = 10`, and `k = 11`.
- The program will incorrectly assume that it can purchase 10 tickets on the first day and 1 ticket on the second day, leading to a cost calculation of `10*1 + 1*2 = 12`.

However, the correct approach would be to purchase 5 tickets on the first day, increasing the price to 5 for the next day, and then purchase 6 tickets on the second day, which would cost `5*5 + 6*6 = 25 + 36 = 61`.

The program fails to account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results in cases where `k` exceeds `m * n`.
