Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is a common practice when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the input integer.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `t` is given as an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - No other variables or lists are mentioned in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

3. Formulate the required state:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
