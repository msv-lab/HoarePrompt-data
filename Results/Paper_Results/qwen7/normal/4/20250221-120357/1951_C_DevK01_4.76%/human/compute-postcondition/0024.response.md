Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list `L` contains these integers. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is that it must be greater than 1.
