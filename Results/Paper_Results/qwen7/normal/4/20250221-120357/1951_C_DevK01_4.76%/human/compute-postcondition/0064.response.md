Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases defined by the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calculates a cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and a sorted list `M`. It sorts the list `M`, determines the number of elements `q` to consider, and then calculates the cost according to specific conditions. The function prints the calculated cost for each test case and continues to the next one until all test cases are processed.**
