Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and we are waiting for further inputs for `n`, `m`, `k`, and list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for `t`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` are yet to be provided. The initial state's condition for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) remains valid.
