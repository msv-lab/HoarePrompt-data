Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n` is an integer representing the length of `N`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to `w`. Since `N` originally contained the first `q` elements of `M`, after popping, `N` now contains the first `q-1` elements of `M`. The value of `w` is the element that was popped from `N`. All other variables remain unchanged.
