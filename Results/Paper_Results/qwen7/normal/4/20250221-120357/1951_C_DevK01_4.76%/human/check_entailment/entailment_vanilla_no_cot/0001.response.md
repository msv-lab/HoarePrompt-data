Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the array `M` representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program sets `m` to be the minimum of `m` and `k`, which ensures that we don't try to buy more tickets than available per day.
   - It sorts the array `M` to facilitate the greedy approach of buying tickets from the cheapest days first.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days needed to buy `k` tickets if we can buy `m` tickets per day.
   - It then extracts the first `q` elements from the sorted array `M` into a new array `N`.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy exactly `k` tickets without needing to increase the price. The cost is calculated as:
     - `m * sum(N)` for the initial cost of buying tickets at the original price.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` for the additional cost due to price increases.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means we need to buy more tickets than the initial `m * n` tickets. The program handles this by:
     - Removing the last element from `N` (which is the most expensive ticket price among the first `q` days).
     - Calculating the number of extra tickets (`mu`) that need to be bought at the last price.
     - Adding the cost of these extra tickets to the total cost.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `4 2 3`
- Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Output: `10`

- Buying 3 tickets:
  - Day 1: Buy 0 tickets (price remains [6, 4, 2])
  - Day 2: Buy 0 tickets (price remains [4, 2])
  - Day 3: Buy 1 ticket (cost 4, new price [3])
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets (cost 6)

- Total cost: `4 + 6 = 10`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `4 2 8`
- Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
- Output: `64`

- Buying 8 tickets:
  - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets (cost 16, new price [8, 6])
  - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets (cost 16, new price [8])
  - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets (cost 16)
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets (cost 16)

- Total cost: `16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64`

#### Example 3:
- Input: `5 100 1`
- Prices: `[10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
- Output: `1`

- Buying 1 ticket:
  - Day 1: Buy 1 ticket (cost 10000)

- Total cost: `10000`

#### Example 4:
- Input: `6 3 9`
- Prices: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
- Output: `72`

- Buying 9 tickets:
  - Day 1: Buy 3 tickets (cost 15, new price [5, 5, 5, 5, 5])
  - Day 2: Buy 3 tickets (cost 15, new price [5, 5, 5, 5])
  - Day 3: Buy 3 tickets (cost 15)

- Total cost: `15 + 15 + 15 = 45`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
