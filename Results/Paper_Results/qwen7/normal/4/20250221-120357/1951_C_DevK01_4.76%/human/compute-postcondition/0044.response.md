Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and assigns the resulting list of integers to `M`. The initial state of `t` and `L` remains unchanged.
