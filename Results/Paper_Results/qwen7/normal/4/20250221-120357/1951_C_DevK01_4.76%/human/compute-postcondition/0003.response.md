Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers entered by the user; `M` is a list of integers converted from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `M`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 and `L` being a list of integers entered by the user remains unchanged. After executing the code, `M` is updated to reflect the list of integers obtained from the user's input.
