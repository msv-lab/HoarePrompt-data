Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `M.sort()` sorts the list `L` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged. After sorting, `L` will contain its elements in ascending order.
