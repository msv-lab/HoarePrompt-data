Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `L` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `M` is the same list of integers sorted in ascending order, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mu * w` to the variable `cost`. Since `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `w` is not defined in the initial state, `cost` is calculated as `mu * w`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
