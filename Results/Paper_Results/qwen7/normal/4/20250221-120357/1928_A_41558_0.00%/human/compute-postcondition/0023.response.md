Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user, and they are either both odd integers, or one is twice the other, or neither is half of the other; regardless of the condition, `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers entered by the user.**
