Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles.
- The provided solution checks two specific conditions:
  1. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'NO'.
  2. If either \(a/2\) equals \(b\) or \(b/2\) equals \(a\), it also prints 'NO'.
- These conditions are necessary but not sufficient to determine if a different rectangle can be formed.
- The conditions given do not cover all cases where a different rectangle can be formed. For example:
  - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the program should print 'YES' because the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, which can then form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
  - However, the current logic incorrectly prints 'NO' for this case because neither \(2\) nor \(6\) is odd, and neither \(2/2\) equals \(6\) nor \(6/2\) equals \(2\).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
