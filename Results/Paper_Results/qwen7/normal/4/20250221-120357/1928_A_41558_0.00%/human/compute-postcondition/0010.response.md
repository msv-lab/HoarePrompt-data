Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `b` is the second integer entered by the user.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- Either `a / 2` equals `b` or `b / 2` equals `a`.

The `print` statement in question is simply printing the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, it will print the string `'NO'` directly.

Output: **'NO'**
