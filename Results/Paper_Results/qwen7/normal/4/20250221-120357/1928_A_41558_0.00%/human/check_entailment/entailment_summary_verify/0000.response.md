Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not handle all edge cases as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to check if one dimension of the rectangle is 1 and the other is greater than 1. According to the problem statement, such a rectangle (e.g., 1 × 4) cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

Let's analyze the given function summary and the updated version of the program:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - It checks if both dimensions are odd.
   - It checks if either dimension is exactly half of the other.
   - If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

2. **Updated Program**:
   ```python
   def func():
       n = int(input())
       for i in range(n):
           (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
           if a == 1 or b == 1:
               print('NO')
           elif a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
               print('NO')
           elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
               print('NO')
           else:
               print('YES')
   ```

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The updated program now includes a condition to check if either `a` or `b` is equal to 1. If so, it prints 'NO', which correctly handles the edge case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1.
   - This additional check ensures that the program correctly identifies that a 1 × b rectangle (where b > 1) cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
   - The other conditions in the program still correctly handle the cases where both dimensions are odd or one dimension is exactly half of the other.

Given that the updated program now correctly handles all the edge cases as described in the problem statement, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is now correct.

Final: **True**
