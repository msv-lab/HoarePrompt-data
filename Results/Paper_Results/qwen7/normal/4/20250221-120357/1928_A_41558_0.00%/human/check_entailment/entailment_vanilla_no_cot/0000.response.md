Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd and prints 'NO' if they are. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.
   
2. **Incorrect Conditions for 'NO' Output**: The conditions `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` and `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` do not cover all scenarios where another rectangle cannot be formed. For instance, a `2x6` rectangle should return 'YES', but the current logic would incorrectly return 'NO' due to the second condition.

3. **General Logic Issue**: The logic needs to check if either `a` or `b` is even, because if at least one dimension is even, it can always be divided into smaller rectangles that can form another rectangle. Additionally, if both dimensions are even, there are more possibilities to form other rectangles.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # If both dimensions are odd, no other rectangle can be formed
        if a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This solution correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the program outputs 'YES' when it is possible to form another rectangle and 'NO' otherwise.
