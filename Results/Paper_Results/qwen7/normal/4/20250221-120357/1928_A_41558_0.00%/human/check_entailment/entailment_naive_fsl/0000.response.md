Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. According to the problem, a 1 × b rectangle (where b > 1) cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle. However, the current implementation does not account for this case properly.

For example, consider the input `1 4`. The program would incorrectly output "YES" because it checks if either dimension is odd or if the dimensions are half of each other, but it does not explicitly check if one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. In this case, the 1 × 4 rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.

To fix this, the program should include a condition to check if either `a` or `b` is equal to 1. Here is an updated version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This updated version correctly handles the case where one dimension is 1, ensuring the program works as expected for all potential cases.
