Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user with specific conditions: they are either both odd integers, or one is twice the other, or neither is half of the other.
- `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers entered by the user.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement is not dependent on the values of any variables but rather outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
