Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. The logic used to determine the minimum number of groups is flawed. Specifically, the approach of using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to map numbers to a unique value that represents their bit pattern is not sufficient to ensure that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit pattern in the first 31 bits.

To correctly solve this problem, we should use a bitmasking approach where each number's 31-bit representation is mapped to a unique integer. This can be achieved by treating the 31-bit representation as a base-2 number and converting it to a decimal integer. This way, numbers with different bit patterns will map to different integers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    # Create a set to store unique bit patterns
    bit_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        # Create a 31-bit mask and apply it to the number
        bit_pattern = 0
        for i in range(31):
            bit_pattern <<= 1
            bit_pattern |= (num >> i) & 1
        # Add the bit pattern to the set
        bit_patterns.add(bit_pattern)
    # The size of the set is the minimum number of groups needed
    return len(bit_patterns)
```

This corrected version ensures that each unique 31-bit pattern is counted only once, thereby providing the correct minimum number of groups required.
