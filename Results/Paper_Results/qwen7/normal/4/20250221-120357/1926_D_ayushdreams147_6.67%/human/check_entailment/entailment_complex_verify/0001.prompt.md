You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be equal to the number of unique elements in the list `a`, and `count` will contain entries for each unique element in `a` transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list 'a', denoted as 'res'. Each unique element in 'a' is transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and these transformed values are stored in the dictionary 'count'. If an element appears more than once in 'a', its corresponding entry in 'count' will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a`, denoted as `res`. During its execution, it transforms each unique element in `a` using the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and stores these transformed values in a dictionary `count`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` is decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to divide a set of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value at any position from 1 to 31 in their binary representations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` which takes the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `a`.
   - It initializes a result counter `res` and a dictionary `count` to keep track of the counts of modified versions of the numbers.
   - For each number `num` in the list `a`, it checks if `num` is already in the `count` dictionary.
     - If not, it modifies `num` using the XOR operation with `(1 << 31) - 1` (which flips all bits of `num`), and increments the count for this modified number. It also increments the result counter `res`.
     - If `num` is already in the dictionary, it decrements the count for `num`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The XOR operation with `(1 << 31) - 1` effectively flips all bits of `num`. This ensures that if two numbers share the same bit pattern in the last 31 bits, their flipped versions will differ in all positions.
   - The logic of incrementing the result counter `res` when a new number is encountered and decrementing the count when a duplicate is found seems to aim at counting the minimum number of groups needed.
   - However, the logic to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from 1 to 31 is flawed because flipping all bits might not guarantee that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any position.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `[1, 2, 3]`. The binary representations are `00000000000000000000000000000001`, `00000000000000000000000000000010`, and `00000000000000000000000000000011`.
   - Flipping all bits gives `11111111111111111111111111111110`, `11111111111111111111111111111101`, and `11111111111111111111111111111100`.
   - These flipped numbers still have matching bits in some positions, violating the condition.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
