### Reasoning:

The given solution attempts to solve the problem by transforming each number using the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and counting the unique transformed values. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Transformation Operation**: The transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all the bits of the number `num`. This means that if a bit in `num` is 0, it becomes 1, and if it is 1, it becomes 0. This effectively changes the sign of the number without changing its magnitude, but in terms of the problem, it ensures that no two numbers share the same bit pattern in the 31 least significant bits.

2. **Counting Unique Values**: By storing the transformed values in a dictionary `count`, the solution ensures that each unique transformed value is counted only once. If a number appears multiple times in the original list, its transformed value will also appear multiple times, but the dictionary will only increment the count once and then decrement it by the number of occurrences minus one.

3. **Result Calculation**: The result `res` is initialized to 0 and incremented each time a new unique transformed value is encountered. This correctly counts the minimum number of groups needed because each unique transformed value represents a different group.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The solution does not correctly handle the case where the same number appears multiple times. Instead of counting the number of groups, it simply counts the number of unique transformed values, which is not necessarily the minimum number of groups required.

To correctly solve the problem, we should use a set to track unique numbers directly, rather than relying on transformations. The correct approach would be to iterate through the list and add each number to a set. The size of the set at the end will give the minimum number of groups required.

### Correct Solution:
```python
def func_1(n, a):
    unique_numbers = set(a)
    return len(unique_numbers)
```

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly count the minimum number of groups. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Correctness: **False**
