Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a`, denoted as `res`. Each unique element in `a` is transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and these transformed values are stored in the dictionary `count`. If an element appears more than once in `a`, its corresponding entry in `count` will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.**
