Output State: **`a` is a list of `n-1` non-negative integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the second element in the list `a`, `res` is incremented by 1 to `res + 1`, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `num`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
