Output State: **The program returns the number of unique elements in the list 'a', denoted as 'res'. Each unique element in 'a' is transformed by the operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and these transformed values are stored in the dictionary 'count'. If an element appears more than once in 'a', its corresponding entry in 'count' will be decremented by the number of times it appears minus one.**
