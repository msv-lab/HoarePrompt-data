Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The given code removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and then counts the number of zeros remaining in the list, which is not the correct approach to find the minimum number of operations needed to make all chips form a single block.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the distance each chip needs to be moved to the leftmost cluster of chips. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the position of the rightmost chip
        rightmost_chip = -1
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if a[i] == 1:
                rightmost_chip = i
                break
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        res = 0
        for i in range(rightmost_chip + 1, n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                res += i - rightmost_chip - 1
        
        print(res)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It finds the position of the rightmost chip.
2. It then iterates through the cells to the right of the rightmost chip, counting how many operations are needed to move each chip to the rightmost chip's position.
3. The result is printed, representing the minimum number of operations required to make all chips form a single block.
