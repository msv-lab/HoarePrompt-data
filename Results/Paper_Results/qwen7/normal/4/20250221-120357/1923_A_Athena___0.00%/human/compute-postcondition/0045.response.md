Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` is the first element of the original list except the first one.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a[0]` was initially 0, after executing the code, `a[0]` will now be the second element of the original list `a`. The list remains non-empty as only the first element is removed.
