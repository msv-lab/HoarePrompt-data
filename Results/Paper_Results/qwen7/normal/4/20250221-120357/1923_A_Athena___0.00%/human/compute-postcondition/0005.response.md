Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while a and a[0] == 0:`. The variables involved here are `a` and `a[0]`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the first element of `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `res` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `a` must not be empty (`a`), and the first element of `a` must be 0 (`a[0] == 0`).

Since `t`, `n`, and `res` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` must not be empty and `a[0]` must be 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` must not be empty and `a[0]` must be 0**
