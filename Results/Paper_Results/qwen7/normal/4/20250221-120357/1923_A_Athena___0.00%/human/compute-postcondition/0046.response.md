Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `a[0]` is the first element of the original list except the first one, meaning it has already been processed in some way.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `a[0]` is the first element of the original list except the first one.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `a` (the list is non-empty) and `a[0] == 0` (the first element of the list is 0) must be true.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `a` must remain a non-empty list.
   - To ensure `a[0] == 0`, `a[0]` must still be 0.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `a` remains a non-empty list and that `a[0]` is still 0.

**Final State**:
- `a` must remain a non-empty list.
- `a[0]` must be 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` is 0**
