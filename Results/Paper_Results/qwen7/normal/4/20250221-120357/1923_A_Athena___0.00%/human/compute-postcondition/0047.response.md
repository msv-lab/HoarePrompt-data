Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list and `a[0]` is the first element of the original list excluding the first element.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Since `a[0]` was originally 0, after executing the code, `a[0]` will now be the second element of the original list `a`. The list remains non-empty as long as there are elements left after removing the first one.
