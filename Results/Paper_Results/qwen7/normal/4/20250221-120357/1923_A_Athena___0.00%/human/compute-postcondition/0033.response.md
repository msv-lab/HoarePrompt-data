Output State: **`i` is 2; `res` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was at least 0 since it's a valid integer). Given no specific initial value for `res` is provided, we assume it starts at 0 for the calculation. Therefore, after executing `res += 1`, `res` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
