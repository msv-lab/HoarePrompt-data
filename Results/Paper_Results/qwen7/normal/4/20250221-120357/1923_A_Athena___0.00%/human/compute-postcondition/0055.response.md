Output State: **`a` is a list without its last element, and the last element of `a` was zero**.

Explanation: The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that the last element of `a` is zero, after executing `a.pop()`, the last element of `a` no longer exists, but the fact that the last element was zero remains true. All other conditions about `a` remain unchanged.
