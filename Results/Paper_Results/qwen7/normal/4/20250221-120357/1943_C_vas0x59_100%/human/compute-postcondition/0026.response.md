Output State: **`d` is assigned the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `path_ba` as a list containing the value of `b`. Since `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, and `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, the list `path_ba` now contains the value of `b`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
