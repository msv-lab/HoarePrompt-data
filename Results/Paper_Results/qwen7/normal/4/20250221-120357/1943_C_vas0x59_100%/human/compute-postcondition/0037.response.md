Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[-1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `d`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `n`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
