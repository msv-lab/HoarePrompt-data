Output State: **`ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `c1` is `b`, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` and must have at least 2 elements, `c2` is -1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]`**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c2` is -1 and `i` is some unspecified value. Therefore, the updated list `ops` now contains two tuples: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
