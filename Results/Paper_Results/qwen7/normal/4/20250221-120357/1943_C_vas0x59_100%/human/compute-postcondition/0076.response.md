Output State: **`ci1` is -1, `i` is 3, `ops` contains the tuples `(-1, 3)` and `(-1, 3)`**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `c2` is not defined in the initial state and no value is explicitly given for `c2`, we assume `c2` is `-1` (the same as `ci1`). Thus, the tuple `(-1, 3)` is appended to `ops`, resulting in `ops` containing both `(-1, 3)` and `(-1, 3)`. The values of `ci1` and `i` remain unchanged.
