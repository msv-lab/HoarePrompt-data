Functionality: **The function processes an input integer `n` and a list `u2vs` representing the edges of a tree. It then performs several operations including a breadth-first search (BFS) from the root node, calls another function `func_1`, and constructs a path from a node `b` back to the root. Based on the length of this path, it creates a list of tuples `ops` which are printed out. Finally, the function returns None.**
