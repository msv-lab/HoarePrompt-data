Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no loops or conditionals are specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their previous values.
