Output State: `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, where each `ni` represents the sequence of nodes traversed until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the current value of `n` is -1.

In this final state, the loop has terminated because the value of `n` became -1, indicating that the path traced back through the `previous` list has reached the start node (index 0), or there is no further node to traverse as per the given conditions.
