The only variable in the loop head is the condition itself, which is `True`. Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute as long as the loop body does not explicitly break out of it. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to any variables or states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n]`, and the current value of `n` is `previous[-1]`.**
