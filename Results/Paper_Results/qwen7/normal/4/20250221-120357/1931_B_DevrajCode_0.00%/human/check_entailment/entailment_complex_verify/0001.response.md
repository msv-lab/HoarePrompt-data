### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The key observation here is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it's always possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water per container is `total_water // n`.
   - If we can transfer water such that each container ends up with this target amount, the operation is successful.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by `n`.
   - It then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount is non-negative.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` by immediately returning 'No'.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the way the cumulative difference is handled. Specifically, the variable `container` is used to track the cumulative difference, but it is not necessary to keep track of this difference to determine if the distribution is possible. Instead, the function should directly check if the sum of the differences (which is zero if the distribution is possible) is non-negative.

5. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input reading and splitting logic is correct for multiple test cases.
   - The function call and output format match the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function Logic:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the total water is divisible by `n`.
  - The cumulative difference (`container`) is not necessary for determining the feasibility of the distribution. Instead, the function should simply check if the sum of the differences between each container's water and the target amount is zero.

- **Corrected Function:**
  - A simpler and more direct approach would be to check if the sum of the differences between each container's water and the target amount is zero. This can be done by checking if the sum of the elements in `a` minus `n * target` is zero.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    return 'Yes' if sum(water - target for water in a) == 0 else 'No'

print(func_1(n, a))
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was partially correct in identifying the key observations and the overall logic. However, the use of the cumulative difference variable `container` is unnecessary and introduces complexity without adding value to the solution. The corrected function simplifies the logic and ensures the program works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
