Output State: **`total_water` is equal to the sum of the integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is `container + (water - target)`, and `water` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `container` by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to it. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
