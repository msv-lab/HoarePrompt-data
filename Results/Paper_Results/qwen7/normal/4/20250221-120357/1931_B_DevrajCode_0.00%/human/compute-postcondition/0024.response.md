The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. Based on the given conditions, the function has five possible return cases, all of which return either 'No' or 'Yes'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is divisible by `n`, and return 'Yes' under specific conditions (which are not detailed here), and 'No' otherwise.
