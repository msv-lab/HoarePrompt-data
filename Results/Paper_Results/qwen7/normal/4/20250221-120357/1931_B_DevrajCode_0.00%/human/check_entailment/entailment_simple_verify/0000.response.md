### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This is done using `total_water % n != 0`. If this condition is true, the function immediately returns "No". This check is necessary because if the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   
2. **Target Calculation**:
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `target = total_water // n`. This ensures that if the water can be evenly distributed, each container should end up with this amount of water.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and maintains a running sum of the differences between the current container's water and the target. This is stored in the variable `container`.
   - If at any point, the cumulative difference (`container`) becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water using the allowed operations, so the function returns "No".
   - If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the function returns "Yes", indicating that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

The logic in the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement. The program correctly handles all valid inputs and ensures that the conditions for making all containers have the same amount of water are met.
