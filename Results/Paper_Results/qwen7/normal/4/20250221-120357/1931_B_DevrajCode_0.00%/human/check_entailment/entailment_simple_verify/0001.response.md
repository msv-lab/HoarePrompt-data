### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The key observation here is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it's always possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water per container is `total_water // n`.
   - If we can transfer water such that each container ends up with this target amount, the operation is successful.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by `n`.
   - It then iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount is non-negative.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the distribution is possible, and the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` by immediately returning 'No'.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the initial distribution is already even, returning 'Yes' without further checks.

5. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The input reading and splitting logic is correct for multiple test cases.
   - The function call and output format match the problem requirements.

6. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:**
   - **Initialization:** The function starts by calculating the total amount of water and checking if it is divisible by `n`. This step is correct.
   - **Target Calculation:** The target amount of water per container is calculated as `total_water // n`. This is correct.
   - **Cumulative Difference Check:** The function iterates through each container, updating the cumulative difference (`container`). If at any point `container` becomes negative, it returns 'No'. This is a crucial part of the algorithm.
   - **Final Check:** If the loop completes without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'. This is also correct.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly checks if it is possible to distribute the water evenly by ensuring that the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount is non-negative.
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the distribution is possible if and only if the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the process.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the program is correct.
