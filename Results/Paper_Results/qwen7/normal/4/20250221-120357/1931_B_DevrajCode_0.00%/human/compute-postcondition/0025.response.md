Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is divisible by `n`. It checks if it's possible to distribute the water in the list `a` such that no container ever has a negative amount of water. If at any point during the distribution, a container has a negative amount of water, the function returns 'No'. If the distribution can be done without any container having a negative amount of water, the function returns 'Yes'.**
