Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 3.
2. `p` is assigned the value of `l[3]`. Since `i` is 3, `p` will be `l[3]`.
3. `q` is assigned the value of `l[l[3] - 1]`. Given that `p` is `l[3]`, `l[3] - 1` is used as the index to get the value of `q`, so `q` will be `l[2]`.
4. `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the number 2.

Output: **2**
