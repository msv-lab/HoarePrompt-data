Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 1 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and if `q` equals `i + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
