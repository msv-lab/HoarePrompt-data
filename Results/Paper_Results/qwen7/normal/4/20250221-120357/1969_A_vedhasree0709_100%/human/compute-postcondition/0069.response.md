Output State: **`i` is 3, `p` is `l[3]`, `q` is `l[l[3] - 1]`, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 remains unchanged.
