Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 6.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be greater than 4.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the integer at index 5 of the list `l`.
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(3)
```

This statement will print the integer 3 directly, regardless of the values of other variables or the conditions described.

Output: **3**
