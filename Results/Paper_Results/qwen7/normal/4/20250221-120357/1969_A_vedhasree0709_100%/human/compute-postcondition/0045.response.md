Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i <= n - 1:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute the first time**: The loop will execute the first time if `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0, the condition simplifies to checking if `0 <= n - 1`, which further simplifies to `n >= 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is already 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`. However, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index 5 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.**
