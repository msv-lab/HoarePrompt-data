Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i <= n - 1:`. The variables involved in this condition are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the first iteration**:
   - The loop will execute if `i <= n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= n - 1`, which further simplifies to `n >= 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is already 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0**
