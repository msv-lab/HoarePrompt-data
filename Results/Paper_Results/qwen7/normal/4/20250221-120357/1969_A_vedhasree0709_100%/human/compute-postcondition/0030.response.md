Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 4 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, and `q`. It only indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
