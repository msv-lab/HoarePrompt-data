Output State: **`i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[1]`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional context that was present in the initial state but is not shown here. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and we indicate that a break occurs.
