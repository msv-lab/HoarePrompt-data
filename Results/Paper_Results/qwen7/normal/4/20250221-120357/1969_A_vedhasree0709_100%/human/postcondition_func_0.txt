The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \), a list of \( n \) distinct integers \( p \), and checks if the sequence described by \( p \) meets a specific condition. If the condition is met within the first two iterations of a loop, it prints `2`. Otherwise, after checking all elements, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
