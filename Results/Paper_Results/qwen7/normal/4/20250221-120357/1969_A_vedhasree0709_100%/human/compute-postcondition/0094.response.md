Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 1 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, `q` is now set to the value of `l[p - 1]`**.

In this output state, the value of `q` has been updated to be the value of the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
