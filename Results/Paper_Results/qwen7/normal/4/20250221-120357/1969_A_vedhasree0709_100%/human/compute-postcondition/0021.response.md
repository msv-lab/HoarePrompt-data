Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 3 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` in the list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
