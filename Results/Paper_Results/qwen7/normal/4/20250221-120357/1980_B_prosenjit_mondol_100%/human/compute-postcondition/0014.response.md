Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `f` is 1 less than the second integer entered by the user, so if the second integer is \(y\), then \(f = y - 1\).
- `k` is the third integer entered by the user minus 1, so if the third integer is \(z\), then \(k = z - 1\).
- `a` is a list containing three integers sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.
- `a[k]` is less than `x`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of any variables other than directly printing the string `'YES'`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
