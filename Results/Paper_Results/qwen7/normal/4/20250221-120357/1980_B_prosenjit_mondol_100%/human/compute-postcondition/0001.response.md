Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the third integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
