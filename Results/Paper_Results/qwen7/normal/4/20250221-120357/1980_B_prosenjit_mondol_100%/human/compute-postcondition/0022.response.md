Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 1 less than the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user minus 1, `a` is a list containing three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, and `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values from the user's input.**

The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states.
