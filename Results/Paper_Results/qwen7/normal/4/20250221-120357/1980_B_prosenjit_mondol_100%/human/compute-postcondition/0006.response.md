Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 1 less than the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user minus 1, `a` is a list containing three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that the list `a` is now sorted in descending order.
