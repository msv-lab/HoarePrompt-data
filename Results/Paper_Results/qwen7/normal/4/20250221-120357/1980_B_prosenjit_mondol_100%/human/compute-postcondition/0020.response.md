Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `f` is 1 less than the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the third integer entered by the user minus 1, `a` is a list containing three integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. After executing the if-else block, `a[k]` remains unchanged, and `x` retains its original value.**
