Output State: **`i` is 3; `removals` must be at least 3; `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is used as an index to access the `-i`th element from the end of the list `elements`. Since `i` is 3, it accesses the `-3`th element (which is the third last element). The value of `elements[-3]` is subtracted from `s`. The `removals` variable is not affected by this operation and still needs to be at least 3.
