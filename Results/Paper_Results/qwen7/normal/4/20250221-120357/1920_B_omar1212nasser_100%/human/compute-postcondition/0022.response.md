Output State: **`i` is 3, `removals` must be at least 3, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `s2` by adding the value of `elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `s2` is initially `s2` minus `elements[-3]`. Since `i` is 3, the updated value of `s2` becomes `s2` minus `elements[-3]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 3)]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
