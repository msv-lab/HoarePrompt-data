Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + 3)]`, `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2]**.

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` updates the value of `s` by subtracting the element at index `-i` from `s`. Initially, `i` is 3, so the element at index `-3` (which is the third last element) is subtracted from `s`. After this operation, `i` is decremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
