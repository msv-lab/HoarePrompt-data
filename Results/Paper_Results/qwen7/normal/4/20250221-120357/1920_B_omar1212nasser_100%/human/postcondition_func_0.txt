The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product value. Finally, it prints the computed product for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the product for each test case.
