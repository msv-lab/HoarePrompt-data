Postcondition: `i` is 2, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`, `negatives` plus `3` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2]`, and if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]` to its current value.
