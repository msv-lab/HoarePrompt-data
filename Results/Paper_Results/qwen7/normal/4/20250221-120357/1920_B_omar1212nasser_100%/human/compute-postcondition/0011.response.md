Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-2]`, `negatives` plus `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * s2]`, `s2` is updated to `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]`**.

Explanation: The line `pos.append(s - 2 * s2)` appends the value of `s - 2 * s2` to the list `pos`. The values of `i`, `removals`, `s`, `s2`, and `negatives` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The only new information is that `pos` now contains the value `s - 2 * s2`. Additionally, `s2` is updated to `s2` plus `elements[-(negatives + i)]`, which means `s2` is adjusted accordingly.
