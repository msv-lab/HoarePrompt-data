Output State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-1]`**

Explanation: The code `s2 -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` from `s2`. Since `i` is 1, `elements[-i]` is equivalent to `elements[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still 1, `removals` must still be greater than 0, and `s` remains as `s` minus `elements[-1]`.
