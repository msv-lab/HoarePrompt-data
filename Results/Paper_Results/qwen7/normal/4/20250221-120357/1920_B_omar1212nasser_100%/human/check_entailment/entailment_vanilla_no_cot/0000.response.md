Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because Alice will want to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob will want to negate the smallest elements to minimize the sum.
3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums after Alice removes elements and Bob negates elements.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the entire array.
   - It iteratively considers removing up to `removals` elements and negating up to `negatives` elements, updating the sum accordingly.
   - For each combination of removed and negated elements, it calculates the new sum and appends it to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after both players have made their moves.

The logic in `func_2` correctly handles all scenarios where Alice and Bob make their optimal choices. The approach ensures that the sum is maximized by Alice's removals and minimized by Bob's negations, aligning with the problem statement.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.
