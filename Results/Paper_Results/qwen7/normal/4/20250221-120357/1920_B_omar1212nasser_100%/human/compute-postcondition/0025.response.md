Output State: **`i` is 3, `removals` must be at least 3, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-3]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-3]`, `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is further adjusted by adding `elements[-(negatives + i)]`, `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`**.

This means that the list `pos` now contains the value `s - 2 * s2` after the operation. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described.
