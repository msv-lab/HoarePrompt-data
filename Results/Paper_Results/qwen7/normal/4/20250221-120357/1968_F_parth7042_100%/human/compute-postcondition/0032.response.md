Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`**.

This means that `r` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]`, which is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
