Output State: **`i` is 4, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `index` is increased by 1, `mp[pf[4]]` contains `[4]`**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` updates the dictionary `mp` such that the key `pf[i]` (which is `pf[4]` in this case) now contains the list `[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
