Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 6, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, and `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]` is met.**
