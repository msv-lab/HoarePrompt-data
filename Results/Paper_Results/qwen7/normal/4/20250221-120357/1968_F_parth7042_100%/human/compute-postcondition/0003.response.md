Output State: **`t` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, `index` is 2**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was set to 1. After executing `index += 1`, the value of `index` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged, so `t` retains its value as an integer from `data[index]` (where `index` was 1), and `data` remains a list of strings representing the split input.
