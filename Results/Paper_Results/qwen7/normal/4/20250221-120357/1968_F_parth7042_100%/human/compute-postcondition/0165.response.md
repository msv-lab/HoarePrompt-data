Output State: **`index` is now `initial_index + 2 * (q + 1) + 2`, `q` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`, `l` and `r` have their final values after `q` updates, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` have their final values after `q` iterations, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all keys are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the element `0`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `mp[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
