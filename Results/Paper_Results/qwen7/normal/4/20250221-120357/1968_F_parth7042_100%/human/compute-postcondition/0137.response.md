Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]` (as an integer), `r` is now an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains either 'NO' or 'YES', depending on whether `x` equals 0, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the position (`it2`) where `r - 1` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain its sorted order. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `results`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated as described.
