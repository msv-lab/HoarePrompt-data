Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]` (as an integer), `r` is now an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO', `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, `q` remains greater than 1, `l` and `r` are as defined, `index` has been incremented by 4, `x` is the XOR result of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` are updated with values from `mp`, and `results` is set to either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition inside the if-else block. The indices `it1` and `it2` are determined for the respective sorted lists `v1` and `v2`.
