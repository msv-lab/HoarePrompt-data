### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the input to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `q` are extracted, representing the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
   - Arrays `a` and `pf` are initialized to store the original array and prefix XOR values, respectively.
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map prefix XOR values to their indices.

3. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is calculated such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - Each prefix XOR value is stored in the dictionary `mp`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR value of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If this XOR value is zero, the subarray is considered interesting, and "YES" is appended to the results.
   - Otherwise, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the dictionary `mp` to check if the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR values.
   - If the conditions are met, "YES" is appended; otherwise, "NO" is appended.

5. **Output:**
   - The results are printed as a single string with each result separated by a newline.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the prefix XOR and checking the subarray's interesting property is correct.
- The use of binary search to find the appropriate indices in the dictionary `mp` is appropriate for determining if the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR values.
- The overall structure and flow of the program align with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
