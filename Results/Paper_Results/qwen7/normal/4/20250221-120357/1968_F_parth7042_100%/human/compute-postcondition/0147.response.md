The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is unchanged as assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is unchanged as the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains 'YES', `it1` is unchanged as the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is unchanged as `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**
