Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 3, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 3, `pf[3]` is `pf[2]` ^ `a[3]`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1 (from 2 to 3). The value of `pf[i]` is updated to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`, which translates to `pf[3]` being `pf[2]` ^ `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
