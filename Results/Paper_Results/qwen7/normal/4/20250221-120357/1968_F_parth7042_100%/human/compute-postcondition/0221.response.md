Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', `q` is greater than 1, `_` is `q - 1`, `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in the range of `v2` up to the end, or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[index])` converts the value of `data[index]` to an integer and assigns it to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
