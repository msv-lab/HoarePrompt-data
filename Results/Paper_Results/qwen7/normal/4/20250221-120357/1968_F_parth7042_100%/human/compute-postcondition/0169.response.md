Output State: **`i` is 2; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that initially `i` is 1, the code sets `pf[1]` to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`. The variable `index` is also mentioned to be increased by 1, which implies that `index` now holds the value it had before plus 1. The value of `i` is updated to 2 after the operation.
