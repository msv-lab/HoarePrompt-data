Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from `data[index]` to the variable `l`. This means `l` now holds the value of the element at the current index of `data`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `q`, and the requirement for `index` remain unchanged, except that `index` is incremented to point to the next element in `data`.
