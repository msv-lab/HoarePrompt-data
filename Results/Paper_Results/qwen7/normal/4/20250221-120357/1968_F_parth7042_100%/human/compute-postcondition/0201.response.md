Output State: **`results` now contains 'YES', 'NO'; `index` is incremented by 3; `l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 4]`; `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 2])`; `x` is 0; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`; `it2` is the value of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; and either `it1` is not less than `len(v1)` or `it2` is less than 0 or `v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to `v2[it2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `'NO'` to the list `results`.
- This means `results` now contains both `'YES'` and `'NO'`.
- The other variables (`index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their previous values as per the initial state, since no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
