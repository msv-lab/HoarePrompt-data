Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases defined within its scope. For each test case, it accepts two integers n and q, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5. It then reads n integers a_1,...,a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}. Finally, it processes q lines, each containing two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, and performs some unspecified operation (not detailed here) on the range [l, r] of the array a.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers and a series of queries on ranges within that array.
