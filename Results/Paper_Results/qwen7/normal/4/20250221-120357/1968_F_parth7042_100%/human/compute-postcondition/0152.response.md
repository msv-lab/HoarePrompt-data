Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `v1` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `it2` is now `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, `results` contains 'YES', `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code updates `it2` to be the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Since `v2` is reassigned to `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is now calculated as `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
