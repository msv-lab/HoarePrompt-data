You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and each test case consists of two integers n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5. The next line contains n integers a_1,...,a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, `n` will retain its final value from the last iteration, `q` will be 0, `index` will be equal to its initial value plus twice the total number of iterations (i.e., `2 * t`), and `results` will contain 'YES' or 'NO' appended based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for all `q` queries.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: ""
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases defined within its scope. For each test case, it accepts two integers n and q, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5. It then reads n integers a_1,...,a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}. Finally, it processes q lines, each containing two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, and performs some unspecified operation (not detailed here) on the range [l, r] of the array a.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
