Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, and if `x` is 0, `results` now contains 'YES' and `index` is incremented by 3.**

In this output state, the variable `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`. All other variables retain their previous states, including the conditions and increments specified in the initial state.
