Output State: **`results` contains 'YES' more than before, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1 - 1`, `index` is `index + 10`, `l` is now `int(data[index])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`**

Explanation: The line `v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]` assigns the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]` to `v2`. This does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the additional detail that `v2` is now equal to `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.
