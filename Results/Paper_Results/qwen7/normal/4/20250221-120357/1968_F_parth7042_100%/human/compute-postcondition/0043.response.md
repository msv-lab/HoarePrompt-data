Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `index` is incremented by 3.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` using `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. It only updates the value of `it2` based on the position where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to maintain a sorted order. Additionally, `index` is incremented by 3 as per the initial state.
