The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of variables but rather controls the flow of the loop. Given the initial state and the presence of `continue`, the following variables are updated:

- `index` is increased by 2.
- The current value of `x` remains 0 (since no operation changes its value).
- The `results` list now contains 'YES'.

Since `continue` does not affect the values of the variables directly, the output state remains the same in terms of variable values, but it indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; the current value of `x` is 0, which is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` list now contains 'YES' and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.**
