Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `mp[0]` is a list containing the value 0, `i` is 6, `pf[6]` is `pf[5]` ^ `a[6]`, `mp[pf[6]]` is a list containing the value 6, `mp[pf[6]]` is updated to include the value 6.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `mp[pf[6]]`. Since `pf[6]` was already a key in the dictionary `mp` with a list containing the value 6, appending 6 again does not change the existing list. Therefore, `mp[pf[6]]` remains a list containing the value 6. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
