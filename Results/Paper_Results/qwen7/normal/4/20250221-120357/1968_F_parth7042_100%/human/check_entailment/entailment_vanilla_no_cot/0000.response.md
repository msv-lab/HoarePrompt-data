Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Function Call Issue**: The program starts with `func_1()` but does not define this function anywhere. This is a syntax error and will cause the program to fail.

2. **Reading Data**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then processes it. However, the way it processes the data is incorrect. Specifically, the indices used to access the data are not correctly managed, leading to potential out-of-bounds errors.

3. **Prefix XOR Calculation and Storage**: The prefix XOR array (`pf`) is correctly calculated, but the logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is flawed. The program incorrectly uses binary search to find suitable split points and checks conditions that do not accurately reflect the problem requirements.

4. **Split Conditions**: The logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is not correctly implemented. The program should check if there exists a valid split such that the XOR of elements in each part is equal. The current implementation does not properly handle this condition.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs the results in a string format, which is acceptable, but the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting needs to be corrected.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Define the `func_1()` function properly.
- Correctly manage the indices when reading and processing the input.
- Implement the logic to check if a subarray is interesting more accurately.
- Ensure the output is formatted correctly.

Here is a revised version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        mp[0].append(0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            
            # Check if there is a valid split point
            for mid in range(l, r):
                if pf[mid] ^ pf[l - 1] == x and pf[r] ^ pf[mid] == x:
                    results.append('YES')
                    break
            else:
                results.append('NO')
    
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_1()
```

This revised version should correctly solve the problem as described.
