Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `A.sort()` sorts the list `A` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and the original list `A` (before sorting) remain unchanged. The only change is that `A` is now sorted.
