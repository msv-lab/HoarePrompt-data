The loop condition is `t`, which is a non-zero integer at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Given that `t` is an integer where \(0 \leq t \leq 4999\) at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure the loop can execute again, `t` must be adjusted to be non-zero. Since `t` was non-zero at the end of the previous iteration, the simplest adjustment would be to ensure `t` remains non-zero.

However, since we cannot assume any specific value for `t` other than it being non-zero, we need to ensure that `t` is not zeroed out within the loop body. But for the purpose of ensuring the loop can execute one more time, we just need to ensure `t` is non-zero.

State: **`t` must be non-zero**
