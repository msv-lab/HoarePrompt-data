Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score according to the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads `n` and the `2n` integers, sorts them, and then calculates the sum of every other element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0] + A[2] + ... + A[2n-2]`). This is equivalent to summing up the minimum pairs since sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired together.
3. **Output**: It prints the calculated sum for each test case.
4. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until all test cases are processed (`t` becomes 0).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the maximum score by always pairing the smallest available numbers, which ensures the highest possible score.

Correctness: **True**
