Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the value of `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads `2n` integers and stores them in the list `A`.
   - The list `A` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (`sum(A[::2])`). This effectively pairs the smallest elements together and sums their minimums, which maximizes the score according to the problem statement.
3. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case.
4. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until all test cases are processed, and the variable `t` is decremented each time a test case is processed, ensuring the loop runs exactly `t` times.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly computes the maximum score for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
