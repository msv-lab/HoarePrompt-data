Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

Let's break down the execution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `A`:**
   - `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - For example, if the input string is `"1,2,3,4,5"`, then `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

2. **Slicing `A[::2]`:**
   - `A[::2]` means taking every second element starting from the first element.
   - For the example `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `A[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.

3. **Summing the Sliced List:**
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of the elements in the sliced list.
   - For the example `A[::2] = [1, 3, 5]`, `sum(A[::2])` would be `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `print` statement will output the result of `sum(A[::2])`.

Since the exact input string is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`.

Output: **sum of every second element in the sorted list A**
