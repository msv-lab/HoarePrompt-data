You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #To explain this in more detail:
    #- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `root`.
    #- After the loop completes, `i` will be greater than `root`.
    #- `root` remains `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    #- `cnt` will be the last value of `i * i` used in the loop, which is 16 when `i` was 4.
    #- `ans` is updated in each iteration by adding `(n + i) // cnt`. After all iterations, `ans` will be `n` plus the sum of these additions for each `i` from 2 to `root`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The program reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which is incorrect.
   - The function `func_1()` takes two parameters \(n\) and \(k\), but these are not used in the logic. Instead, it uses `n` and `m` from the input, which should be passed to the function.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` calculates the number of valid pairs using a specific formula that does not match the problem requirements. It iterates through a range and adds values to `ans`, but this does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition.
   - For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the input and does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
