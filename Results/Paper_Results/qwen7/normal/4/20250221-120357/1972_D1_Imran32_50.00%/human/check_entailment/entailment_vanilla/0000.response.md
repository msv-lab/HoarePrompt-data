Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The program reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which is incorrect.
   - The function `func_1()` takes two parameters \(n\) and \(k\), but these are not used in the logic. Instead, it uses `n` and `m` from the input, which should be passed to the function.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` calculates the number of valid pairs using a specific formula that does not match the problem requirements. It iterates through a range and adds values to `ans`, but this does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition.
   - For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the input and does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
