Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `root`.

2. **Determine the initial values or conditions for these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `root + 1`.
   - `root` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `root`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 2.
   - `root` is calculated based on `n`, so we need to ensure that `root` is correctly set to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `ans` is equal to `n`.
- `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `root` for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**
