Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). The function returns a result based on the conditions given for `n` and `m`, ensuring the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value of `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m`. For each pair, the function evaluates `n` and `m` according to specified conditions and returns a result accordingly, ensuring overall constraints are met.
