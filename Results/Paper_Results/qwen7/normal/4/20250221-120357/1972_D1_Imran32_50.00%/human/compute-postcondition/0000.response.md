Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^6**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
