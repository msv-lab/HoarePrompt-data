### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function takes two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which is actually \(m\) in the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to get `root`.
   - It iterates from 2 to `root` and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The function does not use the variable \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).
   - The function does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function only checks a specific pattern related to the square root of \(n\).

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case \(2 \ 3\):
     - Expected output: 3 (pairs (1,1), (1,2), (1,3))
     - Actual output: 3 (as per the annotated code)
   - The annotated code mentions that the function calculates the number of multiples of certain values within the range of \(n\), which is not the required condition.

4. **Detailed Test Case Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(k = 3\):
     - Valid pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
     - The function calculates:
       - For \(i = 2\): \((2 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 2 // 4 = 0\)
       - For \(i = 3\): \((2 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 5 // 9 = 0\)
     - The function sums up these values and prints \(2\), which is incorrect.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function only checks a specific pattern and does not validate the actual condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not check the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
