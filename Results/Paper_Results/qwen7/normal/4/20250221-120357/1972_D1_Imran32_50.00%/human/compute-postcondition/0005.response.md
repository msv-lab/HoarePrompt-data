Output State: **`i` is 2; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is 4; `ans` is `(n + 2) // 4**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding to it the result of `(n + i) // cnt`. Given the initial values, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 4, and `root` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. However, since `n` is not specified, we keep it as `n` in the expression. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `(n + 2) // 4`. The other variables retain their initial values.
