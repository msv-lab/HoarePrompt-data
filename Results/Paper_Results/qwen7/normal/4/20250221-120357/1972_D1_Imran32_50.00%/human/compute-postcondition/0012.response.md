Output State: `i` is greater than `root`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is not defined in the final state as it changes with each iteration; `ans` is the sum of `n` and the series `(n + i) // cnt` for all `i` from 2 to `root`.

To explain this output state in natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be greater than `root`, which is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. The variable `cnt` is no longer relevant since its value changes with each iteration of the loop. The variable `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // cnt` for every `i` starting from 2 up to and including `root`. The exact value of `ans` depends on the initial values of `n` and `t`, but it will be the result of adding these computed values to `n`.
