The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of binary strings), and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` based on certain conditions comparing characters from `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the current character in `a` is greater than the next character in `a` and less than the corresponding character in `b`, it appends the character from `a`; otherwise, it appends the character from `b`. After constructing `ans`, it prints `ans` and then counts the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b`, printing this count as well. The function ultimately outputs the constructed string `ans` and the count of consecutive matching characters for each test case.
