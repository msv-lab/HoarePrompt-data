Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the value of `t` is the integer input from stdin.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
        else:
            break
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 3, and `j` is 2.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `counter` will be 3 because the loop continues as long as the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is met. The loop starts with `j` being 0 and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the second last character of string `a`. Therefore, `j` will be 2 after the loop finishes. Since the loop condition is met three times, `counter` will be 3. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states, as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` with subsequent characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions inside the loop, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the new input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will terminate when the condition `a[j + 1] != b[j]` and `a[j + 1] != '0'` or `b[j] != '1'` is met, or when `j + 1` equals the length of `a`. The final value of `counter` depends on the sequence of elements in `a` and `b`. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]` at any point, `counter` increments. If `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'`, `counter` resets to 1 but does not increment further. The final value of `j` will be `len(a) - 2`, assuming the loop completes without breaking early.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
