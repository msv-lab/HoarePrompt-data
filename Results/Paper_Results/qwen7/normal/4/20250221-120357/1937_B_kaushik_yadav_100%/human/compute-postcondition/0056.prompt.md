Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is set to True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions inside the if and else blocks, and `work` is set to `False`. If `i` is 2, `ans` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, and `work` is set to `False` if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` remains `True`. If `i` is 1, `ans` is the string `b[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is updated to `ans` + `a[3]`. If `work` is true and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is further updated to `ans` + `b[3]` + `b[3]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans` + `b[3]` if `i` is 4.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `i` is either 4 or 5, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `i` is 3, `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]`; if `i` is 4, `ans` is `ans` + `a[4]` + `b[3]`; if `i` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `b[4]`. Additionally, if `i + 1` equals the length of array `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
