Output State: **`counter` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` must have more than 1 element, and `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `'0'` or `b[j]` is not equal to `'1'` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Therefore, the values of `counter`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as in the initial state.
