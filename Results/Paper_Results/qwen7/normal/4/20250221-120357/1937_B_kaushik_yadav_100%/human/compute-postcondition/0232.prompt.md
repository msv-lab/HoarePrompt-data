Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is True, `ans` is an empty string, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `work`, `ans`, `counter`, `t`, `a`, and `b` are as follows:
- `i` is either 1 or 2.
- `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1.
- `work` is either True or False depending on the condition.
- `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `a`.
- `counter` is either 1 or 2.
- `t` is 0.
- `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
- `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is either 3 or 2, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `a[1]` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[1]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `i` is either 3, 4, or 5. If `i` is 3 or 4, `ans` is increased by `a[i]` if `i` is 3 or by `a[i-1]` if `i` is 4 or 5. If `i` is 4, `ans` is also increased by `a[3]`. If `i` is 4 or 5, `ans` is increased by `b[i-1]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
