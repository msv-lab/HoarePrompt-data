Postcondition: **`i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 2, and `j` is 1. If the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true, `counter` becomes 2. Otherwise, if the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is false, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, keeping the original values of `counter` and `j`.**
