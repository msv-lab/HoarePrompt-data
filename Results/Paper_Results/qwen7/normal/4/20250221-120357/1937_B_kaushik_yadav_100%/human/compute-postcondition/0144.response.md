Postcondition: `work` is either False or True, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `a[i]` and then concatenated with `b[i]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`. Otherwise, `i` is 4, and `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `a[i]`. `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string with length greater than 0, and `b` is the new input string.
