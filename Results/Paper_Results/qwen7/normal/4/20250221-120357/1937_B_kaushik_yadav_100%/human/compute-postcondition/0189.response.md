Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is True, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` is updated to be the first character of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
