Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`**.

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns the result to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
