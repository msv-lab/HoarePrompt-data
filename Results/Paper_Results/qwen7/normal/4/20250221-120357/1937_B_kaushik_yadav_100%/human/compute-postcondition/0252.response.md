Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `counter` is either 1 or 2.
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `a` has more than 1 element.

4. **Consider the loop body behavior**:
   - If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is set to 2.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the condition remains as specified in the if part.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is not '0' or `b[j]` is not '1', the loop or if statement is exited.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0, the next value of `j` would be 1 (i.e., `j = 0 + 1`).
   - We need to ensure that `j` is still less than `len(a) - 1` for the loop to continue.

6. **Check the length of `a`**:
   - Given that `a` has more than 1 element, `len(a) - 1` is a positive integer.
   - For `j` to be less than `len(a) - 1`, `j` should be 1 (the next possible value).

7. **Final state**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `counter` remains either 1 or 2 based on the loop body execution.
   - `a` still has more than 1 element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, `a` has more than 1 element**.
