Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to `ans`. Initially, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `a[1]`. After executing the code, `ans` becomes the first character of `a` followed by `b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
