Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads a new input string from the user and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This new string is assigned to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `counter`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
