Postcondition: `work` is either False or True, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with either `a[i]` or `b[i]` depending on the value of `i + 1` relative to the length of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` includes `b[i]`; otherwise, `i` is 4 and `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `a[i]`. `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string with a length greater than 0, and `b` is the new input string.
