Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is increased by `a[i]`; `work` is False**

Explanation: The variable `work` is set to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `ans`. The initial state of `i` being either 3 or 4 and `ans` being increased by `a[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is increased by `a[i]`, and `work` is set to `False`.
