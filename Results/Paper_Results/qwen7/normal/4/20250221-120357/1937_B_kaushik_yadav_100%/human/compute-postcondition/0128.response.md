Postcondition: `work` is either False or True, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the character at index `i` of the appropriate string (`b[i]` or `a[i]`), `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is less than or equal to the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.
