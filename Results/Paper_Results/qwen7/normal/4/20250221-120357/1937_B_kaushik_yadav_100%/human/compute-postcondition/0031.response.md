Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is `ans` + `b[3]` + `b[3]`**

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 3; `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]`. The code snippet updates `ans` by adding `b[i]` to it. Since `i` is 3, `b[i]` is `b[3]`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `ans` + `b[3]` + `b[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
