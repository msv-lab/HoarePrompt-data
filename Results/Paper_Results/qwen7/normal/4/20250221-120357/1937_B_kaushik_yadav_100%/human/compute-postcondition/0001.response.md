Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the value of `t` is the integer input from stdin.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged except that `t` now holds the value of the integer input. The binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are not affected by this line of code.
