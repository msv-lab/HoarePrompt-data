Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is set to True.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `work`. This does not affect any of the other variables' values or states. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of all variables except for `work`, which is now `True`.
