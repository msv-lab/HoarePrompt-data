Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is `ans` + `b[3]` + `b[3]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits whatever loop or conditional block the code was inside. However, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `ans`. The value of `ans` remains as `ans` + `b[3]` + `b[3]`, and `i` remains 3.
