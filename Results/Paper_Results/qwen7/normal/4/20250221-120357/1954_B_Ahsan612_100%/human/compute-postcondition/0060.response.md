The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than one element, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**
