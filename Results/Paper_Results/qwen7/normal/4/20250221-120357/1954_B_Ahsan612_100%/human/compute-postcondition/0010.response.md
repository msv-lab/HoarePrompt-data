Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer and the length of `ar` must be greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is set to infinity, `i` is 1, the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
