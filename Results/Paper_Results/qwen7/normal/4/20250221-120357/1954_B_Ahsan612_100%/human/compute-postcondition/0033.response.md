Output State: **`same` is 3 or 1, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is 2 or `min(minn, same)`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value (which is 2 or unchanged) and the value of `same` (which is 3 or 1). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
