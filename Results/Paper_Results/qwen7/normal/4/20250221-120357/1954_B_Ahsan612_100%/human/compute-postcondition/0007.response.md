Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the current state of variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `i` and `len(ar)`, but since `i` is fixed at 1, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer and the length of `ar` must be greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is set to infinity, `i` is 1**
