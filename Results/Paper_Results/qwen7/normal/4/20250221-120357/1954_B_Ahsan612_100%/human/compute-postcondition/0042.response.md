Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1.
- `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- `minn` is equal to `inf` or the length of `ar` since the condition `minn == inf or minn == len(ar)` is true.

The `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
