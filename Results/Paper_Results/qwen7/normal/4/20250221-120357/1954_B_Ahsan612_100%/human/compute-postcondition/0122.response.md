Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `same` is either 1, 2, or 3.
   - `num` is equal to `ar[i-1]`.
   - `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to a value that is still less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given that `ar` has a length greater than 1, the smallest possible value for `len(ar)` is 2 (since it's greater than 1).
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than 2 for the loop to execute one more time, but since `i` is currently 4, this is not possible without adjusting `i`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to adjust `i` to a value that satisfies the loop condition `i < len(ar)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, we need to set `i` to a value less than the length of `ar`.

Given that `ar` has a length greater than 1, the smallest possible length is 2, and `i` must be less than this length for the loop to execute one more time. However, since `i` is currently 4, we need to set `i` to a value less than the length of `ar`.

State: **`i` must be less than the length of `ar`, and `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1**.
