Output State: **`same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `same`, and `minn` is either `inf`, the length of `ar`, or a specific integer value found in `ar`.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
