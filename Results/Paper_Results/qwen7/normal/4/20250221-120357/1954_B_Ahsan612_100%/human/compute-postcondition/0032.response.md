Output State: **`same` is 3 or 1, `t` is as before, `n` is as before, `ar` is as before, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is 2 or unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`. The values of `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and `i` before the code execution are preserved.
