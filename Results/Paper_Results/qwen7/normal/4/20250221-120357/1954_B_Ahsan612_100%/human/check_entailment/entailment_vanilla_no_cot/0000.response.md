Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum segment length where consecutive elements are the same. However, this approach does not account for the requirement to remove elements to break the "beautiful" property.
   - The program only counts the length of segments where consecutive elements are the same but does not consider the possibility of breaking these segments by removing elements.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of removals to ensure the array is no longer "beautiful." The provided solution does not address this requirement effectively.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - For example, in the test case `3 1 2 1 2 1`, the program would incorrectly handle the segments without considering the need to break them.

To correctly solve this problem, one should:
- Identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical through the allowed operations.
- Calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break this sequence.

Here is a revised version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment where consecutive elements are the same
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == ar[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # If the entire array is identical, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of removals needed is the length of the longest segment minus 1
            print(max_length - 1)

func()
```

This revised program correctly identifies the longest segment where consecutive elements are the same and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break this segment.
