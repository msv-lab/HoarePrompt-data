Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `minn` remains unchanged as the code does not affect `minn`. The precondition that `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar` also remains valid.
