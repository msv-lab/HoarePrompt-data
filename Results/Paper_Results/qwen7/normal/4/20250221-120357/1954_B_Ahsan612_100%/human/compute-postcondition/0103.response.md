Output State: **`i` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input with its length greater than 1, `minn` is infinity, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 2, `num` is equal to the first element of the list `ar`, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
