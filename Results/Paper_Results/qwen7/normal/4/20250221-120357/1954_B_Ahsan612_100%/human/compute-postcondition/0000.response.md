Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that will be used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` (the number of test cases) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the loop will run from 0 to \(t-1\).

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. The initial state should reflect that the input value will be valid for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input value is valid.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
