Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is the smallest value between its original value and the current value of `same`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. This changes the value of `same` to 1, but does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
