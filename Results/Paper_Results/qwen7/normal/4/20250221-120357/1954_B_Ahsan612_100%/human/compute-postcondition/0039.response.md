Output State: `same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop, and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `same` will hold the maximum consecutive count of the same integer found in the list `ar`, starting from the first element. The variable `minn` will store the minimum value between its initial value (set to infinity) and the highest `same` value encountered during the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` since the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
