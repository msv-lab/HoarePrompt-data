Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. This means `i` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1. Since `minn` is compared with 1 and the condition `minn != inf` and `minn != len(ar)` holds true, `minn` must be 1 because it cannot be infinity (`inf`) and it cannot be equal to the length of `ar` (which is `i`).
- `same` is equal to 1. This is a separate variable and does not affect the value of `minn`.
- `n` is an input integer, but it does not influence the value of `minn`.
- `num` is not specified, so it does not impact the value of `minn`.

Given this information, the `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
