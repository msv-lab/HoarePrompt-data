Output State: **`i` is 4, `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is equal to `ar[3]`, and `ar[3]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to be equal to `ar[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `num` now holds the value of `ar[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
