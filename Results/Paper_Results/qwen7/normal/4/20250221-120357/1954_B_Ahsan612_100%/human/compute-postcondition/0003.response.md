Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `same = 1` simply assigns the integer value `1` to the variable `same`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `ar`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
