Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, and `x` remains unchanged.**

The code `t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n` updates the value of `t1` based on the current value of `a[i]`, which was previously defined as `(a[i] + 1) % n`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `t2`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
