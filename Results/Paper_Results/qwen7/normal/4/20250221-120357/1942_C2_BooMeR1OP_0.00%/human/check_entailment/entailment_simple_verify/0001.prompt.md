You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Processing Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program converts the chosen vertices to zero-based indexing (`a = [num - 1 for num in a]`).
   - It sorts the chosen vertices (`a.sort()`).

3. **Initial Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of triangles using the formula `ans = x - 2`. This is because any three vertices can form a triangle, and we start with `x` vertices.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to find gaps.
   - For each gap, it calculates the number of pairs of vertices that can be added without causing intersections (`pairs = gap // 2`).
   - If `y` is greater than or equal to the number of pairs, it adds the full gap to the answer and reduces `y` accordingly.
   - If `y` is less than the number of pairs, it adds twice the value of `y` to the answer and breaks the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final number of triangles for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initialization of `ans = x - 2` is correct since any three vertices can form a triangle, and we start with `x` vertices.

2. **Gap Handling:**
   - The logic for handling gaps is sound. It ensures that the added vertices do not intersect with existing diagonals.
   - The calculation of pairs (`pairs = gap // 2`) is correct for determining how many additional vertices can be added without causing intersections.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `y` is less than the number of pairs by adding only twice the value of `y`, which is correct because adding more than twice would cause intersections.

4. **Sorting and Iteration:**
   - Sorting the chosen vertices and iterating through them to find gaps is a valid approach to ensure that the added vertices do not intersect with existing diagonals.

5. **Input Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, including the limits on `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program handles all aspects of the problem statement accurately and efficiently.
