Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and `a` is a list containing three integers assigned from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads three integers from the input and splits them into a list. These integers are then assigned to the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
