Postcondition: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, and must not be empty, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x`, `i` is equal to `x`, `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, and the current value of `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`.**
