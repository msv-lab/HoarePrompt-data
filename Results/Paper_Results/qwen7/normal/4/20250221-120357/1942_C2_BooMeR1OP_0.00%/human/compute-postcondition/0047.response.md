Output State: `gaps` will contain the list of all `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` will be equal to the total number of iterations `x`, and `i` will be equal to `x`.

To explain this in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `gaps` will hold a list of all the positive `gap` values that were calculated during the loop's execution. The variable `ans` will have been incremented by the total number of iterations `x`, making its value equal to `x`. Additionally, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `x` after the last iteration.
