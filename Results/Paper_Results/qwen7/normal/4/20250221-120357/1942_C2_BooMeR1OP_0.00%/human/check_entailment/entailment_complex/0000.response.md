Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of `x` chosen vertices.
3. The program sorts the list of chosen vertices and calculates an initial value for `ans` (which is `x - 2`).
4. It then checks for additional triangles that can be formed using the adjacent vertices and the vertices that are one step ahead in the sorted list.
5. After that, it calculates the gaps between the chosen vertices and sorts them.
6. It iteratively uses these gaps to maximize the number of triangles, taking into account the limit `y` on the number of additional vertices that can be chosen.
7. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the solution as required. The program handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
