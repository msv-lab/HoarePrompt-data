Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `gaps` is `[gap, gap]` if `gap > 0`, otherwise it remains an empty list.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `next_elem` is `a[3] + (n if 1 == x - 1 else 0)`.
   - `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` changes to 4.
   - `x` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

6. **Other variables**:
   - `gaps`, `ans`, `next_elem`, and `gap` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 4, while `x` remains unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`gaps` is `[gap, gap]` if `gap > 0`, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list; `ans` is 0; `i` is 4; `next_elem` is `a[3] + (n if 1 == x - 1 else 0)`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`**
