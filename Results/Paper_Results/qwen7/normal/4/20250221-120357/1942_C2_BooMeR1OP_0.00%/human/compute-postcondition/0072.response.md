Postcondition: `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values that were greater than 0 during the iterations, `ans` is equal to the total number of iterations `x` plus either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs - gap // 2`) or `4 * y` (if `y` is less than `gap // 2`) plus an additional `gap` or `2 * y` depending on the condition, `i` is equal to `x`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is either decreased by `pairs` if the condition `y >= pairs` is true, or the loop is exited if the condition is false.
