### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, parsing `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Triangular Pieces Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangular pieces `ans` is correctly set to `x - 2` because a polygon with `x` chosen vertices can initially form `x - 2` triangles.

3. **Handling Adjacent Vertices:**
   - The program checks for adjacent vertices that can form additional triangles without overlap. This is done by iterating through the chosen vertices and checking if the next vertex (considering wrap-around) is available and can form a new triangle.

4. **Gaps Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and stores these gaps in the `gaps` list. This helps in determining how many additional triangles can be formed using these gaps.

5. **Optimizing Triangles Using Gaps:**
   - The program sorts the gaps and iteratively uses them to form additional triangles. It ensures that the number of triangles formed does not exceed the remaining available vertices (`y`).

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the total number of triangular pieces, which is the sum of the initial triangles and the additional triangles formed using the gaps.

Given the logical flow and the steps taken to ensure the correct calculation of the maximum number of triangular pieces, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example.
