Postcondition: `ans` is increased by 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, and `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, provided that `t1` is not in `present` and `t2` is in `present`. If the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is not met, the values of `ans`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their preconditions.
