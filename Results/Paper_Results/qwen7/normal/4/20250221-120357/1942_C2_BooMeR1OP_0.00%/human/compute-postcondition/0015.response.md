Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x` is the same.**

Explanation: The code updates `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. The previous value of `t1` was `(a[i] + 1) % n`, which is now updated to `(a[i] + 1) % n` again because the expression hasn't changed. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
