Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). For each test case, it checks if \(m\) is at least as large as both \(a\) and \(b\). If \(m\) is smaller than either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 2. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the value of \(m // a + m // b + 2\). The function reads these integers from standard input and outputs the results to standard output, producing a total of up to 10,000 lines of output.**
