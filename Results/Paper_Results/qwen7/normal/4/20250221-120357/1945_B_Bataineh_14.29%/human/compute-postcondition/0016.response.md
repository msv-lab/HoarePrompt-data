Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), and `i` remains 2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers entered by the user.
