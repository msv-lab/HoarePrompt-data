Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
   
2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. If `m` is smaller than either `a` or `b`, it prints `2`. This is correct because if `m` is smaller than either `a` or `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time would be 2 (one from each installation).

3. **Calculation and Output**: If `m` is not smaller than both `a` and `b`, the program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation using integer division (`m // a` and `m // b`). The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` correctly accounts for the fact that fireworks from both installations can overlap in visibility, and the `+2` ensures that fireworks from the same installation are counted correctly even if they overlap.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `m` might be exactly equal to `a` or `b` correctly, ensuring that the maximum number of fireworks visible is calculated accurately.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the result for each test case on a new line, which matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
