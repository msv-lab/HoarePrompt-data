Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers equal to the values entered by the user. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
