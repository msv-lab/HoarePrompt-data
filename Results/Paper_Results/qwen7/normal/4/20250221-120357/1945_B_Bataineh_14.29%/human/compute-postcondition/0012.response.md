Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers equal to the values entered by the user.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer 2, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output: **2**
