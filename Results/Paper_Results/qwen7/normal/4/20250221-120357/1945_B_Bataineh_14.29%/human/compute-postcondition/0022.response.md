Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (t being the number of test cases). It returns different values based on the relationship between a, b, and m for each test case.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters through a set of test cases, each containing integers a, b, and m. For each test case, the function evaluates the relationship between a, b, and m and returns a specific value accordingly.
