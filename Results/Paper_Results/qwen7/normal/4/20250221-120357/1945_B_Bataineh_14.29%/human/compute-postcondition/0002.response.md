Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` depend on the input provided by the user, which are converted to integers.
