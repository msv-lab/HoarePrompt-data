Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
2. `func_1()` checks several conditions to ensure that the given prefix and suffix maximums can form a valid permutation:
   - The last element of `L` must equal the first element of `R`.
   - The first element of `L` must be 1, and the first element of `R` must be `N`.
   - If both `L` and `R` have more than one element, the second-to-last element of `L` should not equal the second element of `R`.
3. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns 0, indicating no valid permutations can be formed.
4. If the conditions pass, the function calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial mathematics:
   - It calculates the number of ways to place the largest element (`L[-1]`) in the permutation.
   - It then iterates through the remaining positions, ensuring that the constraints on `L` and `R` are maintained.
5. The provided execution summary matches the logic of the program, confirming that the program correctly implements the solution based on the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
