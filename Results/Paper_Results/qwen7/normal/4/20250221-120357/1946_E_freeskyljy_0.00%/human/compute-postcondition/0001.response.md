Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `L`. The variables `t`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are still positive integers obtained from the input.
