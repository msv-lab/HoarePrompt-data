Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is either 2 or 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `i` must be less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1, and if `i == R[cur]`, then `cur` becomes 2; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was `i + 1`. After executing the code, `i` becomes `i + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
