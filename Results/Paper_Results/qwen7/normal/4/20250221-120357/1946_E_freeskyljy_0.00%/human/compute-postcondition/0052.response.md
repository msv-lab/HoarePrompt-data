Output State: **`cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` retains its initial value of 1. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `R[0] + 1`, where `R[0]` is an element from a list or array `R` at index 0. The initial value of `cur` remains unchanged, and `i` now holds the value of `R[0] + 1`.
