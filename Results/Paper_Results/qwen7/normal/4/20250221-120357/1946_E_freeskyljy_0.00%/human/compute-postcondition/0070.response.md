Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `N`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `i` must be less than `N` and `N` being greater than `R[0] + 1` remains valid.
