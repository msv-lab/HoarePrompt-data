The variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `N`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and must still be less than `N`, and `N` must remain greater than `R[0] + 1` for the loop to continue, no adjustments are necessary to these conditions as they are already satisfied based on the given constraints.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition that `i` is less than `N`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i` remains less than `N` for the next iteration. Since `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, we don't need to change `N` but need to ensure `i` is still valid.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `i` is less than `N` and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.

State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `N`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1**
