Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `i` must be less than `N`, `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1, ans` is `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by multiplying its current value with `nums_left` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. Since `nums_left` is reduced by 1, the new value of `ans` is `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`. The values of `cur`, `i`, `N`, and `R[0]` remain unchanged.
