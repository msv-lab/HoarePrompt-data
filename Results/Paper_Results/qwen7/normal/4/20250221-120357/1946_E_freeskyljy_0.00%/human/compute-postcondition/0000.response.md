Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) still holds true. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are now specific integers obtained from the input, but their exact values depend on the user's input.
