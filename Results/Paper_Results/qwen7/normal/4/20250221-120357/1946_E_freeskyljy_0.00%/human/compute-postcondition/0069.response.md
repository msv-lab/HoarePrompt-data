Output State: **`nums_left` is reduced by 1, `cur` is 1, `i` must be less than `N`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. All other variables (`cur`, `i`, `N`, and `R`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the output state reflects this change specifically for `nums_left`.
