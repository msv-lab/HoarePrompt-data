Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - 3`, and the current value of `i` is equal to `L[cur]`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cur` was equal to `M1 - 2`. After decrementing, `cur` becomes `M1 - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
