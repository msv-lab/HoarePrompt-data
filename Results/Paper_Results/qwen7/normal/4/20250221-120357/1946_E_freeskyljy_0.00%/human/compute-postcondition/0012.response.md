Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers with its second last element equal to the second element of `R`, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using map and int functions, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.
