Output State: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - len(L)`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - len(L)`, `i` is 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be decremented to 1 because it starts from `L[-1] - 1` and gets reduced by 1 in each iteration until it becomes 1. The variable `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - len(L)` as it decreases by 1 in each iteration. The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless `i` equals `L[cur]`, but since `i` ends up being 1 and we don't know the exact values of `L` and `cur`, we can't specify if `ans` changes during the loop. However, based on the given information, `ans` is initially set and doesn't change unless explicitly updated inside the loop, which doesn't happen in the provided states. Therefore, `ans` remains as the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
