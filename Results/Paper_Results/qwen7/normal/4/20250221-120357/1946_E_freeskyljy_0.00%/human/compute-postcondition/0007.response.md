Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using map and int functions, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is not 1 or the first element of `R` is not equal to `N`.**
