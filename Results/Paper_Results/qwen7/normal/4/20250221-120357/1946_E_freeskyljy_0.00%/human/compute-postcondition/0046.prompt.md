Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using map and int functions, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, and either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`; `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - 3`, `i` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `cur` is `M1 - 4`, `i` is 1, if `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `ans` remains unchanged, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `cur` is `M1 - 5`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers converted from the input using `map` and `int` functions, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, either `M1` is not greater than 1, or `M2` is not greater than 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, and `i` is now greater than 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
