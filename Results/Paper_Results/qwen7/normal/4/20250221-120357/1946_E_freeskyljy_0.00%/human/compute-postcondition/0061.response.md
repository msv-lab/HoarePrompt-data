Postcondition: `cur` is 2, `i` is equal to `R[1]`, and `N` must be greater than `R[1]`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to 2, `i` is set to `R[1]`, and `N` must be greater than `R[1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the value of `ans * nums_left % MOD`, `cur` remains 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`.
