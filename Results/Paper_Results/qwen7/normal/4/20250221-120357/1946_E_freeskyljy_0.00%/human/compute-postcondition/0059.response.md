Output State: **`ans` is updated to the value of `ans * nums_left % MOD`, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `N` is greater than `R[0] + 1`, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`**.

This means that the variable `ans` has been updated to its current value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, `N`, and the condition on `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
