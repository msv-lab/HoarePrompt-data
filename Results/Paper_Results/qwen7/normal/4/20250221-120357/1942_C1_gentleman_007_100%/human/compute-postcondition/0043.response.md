Output State: **All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` is empty.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every node that can be reached from the starting node (`ver`) will have been visited, meaning `vis[node]` will be 1 for all such nodes. Additionally, since each node is added to `q` and then removed (using `popleft()`), and the loop continues only if there are unvisited nodes in `graph[ver]`, once all reachable nodes are visited, `q` will eventually become empty.
