Output State: **`i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j - 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is now `j - 1`, while `i` remains `i - 1`, and the conditions involving `dp[i][j]` still hold true.
