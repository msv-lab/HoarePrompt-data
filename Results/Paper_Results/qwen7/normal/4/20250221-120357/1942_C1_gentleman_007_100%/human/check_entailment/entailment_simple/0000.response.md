Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a polygon.
2. The solution logic is straightforward: it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed using the given vertices and the remaining vertices that can be chosen.
3. The program correctly processes each test case by:
   - Reading the input values \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - Sorting the chosen vertices.
   - Counting the number of triangles that can be formed using the given vertices.
   - Handling edge cases where the first and last vertices form a triangle.
4. The program does not use any of the defined functions (1 to 25) that are not relevant to solving the problem directly.
5. The logic for counting triangles is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
