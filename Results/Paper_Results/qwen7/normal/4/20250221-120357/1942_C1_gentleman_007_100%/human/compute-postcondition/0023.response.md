Output State: **All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node (initial value of `ver`) are marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and `q` contains all the nodes that were added during the iterations of the loop.**

In more detail:
- The variable `q` will contain all nodes that were added to the queue during the loop's iterations.
- The variable `ver` remains unchanged as it refers to the initial node from which the traversal started.
- The variable `graph` remains unchanged because no modifications are made to it within the loop.
- The variable `vis` will have all nodes that are reachable from `ver` marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`).
- The loop continues until there are no more unvisited neighbors of the current node (`ver`).
