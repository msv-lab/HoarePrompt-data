Postcondition: `ver` retains its original value, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one node where `vis[node]` is equal to 0, and after the execution of the if-else block, `vis[node]` for the node that was processed (either directly in the if part or implicitly in the else part, which is not applicable here) is set to 1.
