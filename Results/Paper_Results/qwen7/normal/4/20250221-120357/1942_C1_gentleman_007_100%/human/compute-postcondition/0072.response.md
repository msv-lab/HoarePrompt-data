Output State: **`i` is `i - 1`, `j` must be non-zero, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`**.

The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it `i - 1`. The conditions for `j` and the values of `dp[i][j]` relative to its neighbors remain unchanged.
