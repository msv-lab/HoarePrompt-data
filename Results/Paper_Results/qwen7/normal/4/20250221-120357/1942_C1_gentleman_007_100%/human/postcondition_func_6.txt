The function accepts a list of integers `l` and processes each integer by counting their occurrences, storing these counts in a dictionary `d`. After processing all elements in `l`, it returns the dictionary `d`, which contains each unique integer from `l` as keys and their respective counts as values. Finally, the function returns an empty dictionary because the original list `l` is emptied during the process.
