Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Input Reading**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), followed by the parameters `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case. Since `y = 0`, we don't need to consider additional vertices.

2. **Vertex Input**: The code reads `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices and sorts them. This is correct.

3. **Triangle Count Calculation**:
   - The code initializes `ans` to `x - 2`, which is the minimum number of triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list of vertices to check if consecutive vertices are exactly 2 apart, which indicates a potential triangle. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - It also checks if the first and last vertices form a valid triangle with the next and previous vertices, respectively, and increments `ans` accordingly.

4. **Output**: The code prints the calculated `ans` for each test case, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the logic appears to be sound. The code correctly handles the input, processes the vertices, and calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without intersecting diagonals.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
