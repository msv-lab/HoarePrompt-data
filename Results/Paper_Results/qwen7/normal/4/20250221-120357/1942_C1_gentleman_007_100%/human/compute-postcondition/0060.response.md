Output State: **`vis[node]` is set to 1, `graph[ver]` contains the remaining nodes (one less than before), and `q` now contains the node that was previously in `q` plus the new `node`.**

This means that the `vis[node]` variable is now set to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. The `graph[ver]` variable still contains the remaining nodes, but one less than before. Lastly, the `q` queue now includes the node that was previously in `q` plus the newly added `node`.
