The function `func_6` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function iterates `m` times, each time calling `func_1()` to get a pair of vertex indices `(x, y)` (where `1 ≤ x, y ≤ n` and `x ≠ y`). It then marks these pairs in a 2D list `l` by setting `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` to 1. After completing the iterations, the function returns the 2D list `l` with dimensions `m + 3` by `m + 3`, where `m` pairs of indices are marked as 1, indicating the chosen vertex pairs. The variables `x` and `y` represent the last pair of indices returned by `func_1()`.
