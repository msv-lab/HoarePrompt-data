Output State: **`vis[node]` is set to 1, `graph[ver]` contains the remaining nodes (one less than before), and `q` now contains the node that was previously in `q` plus the new `node`.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `vis[node]` is still set to 1, `graph[ver]` still contains the remaining nodes (one less than before), and `q` now includes the node that was previously in `q` along with the new `node`.
