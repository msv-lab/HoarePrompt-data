Output State: **`q` is an empty deque, `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, and `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. The variable `vis` is a list or array of boolean values used to keep track of visited vertices, with the same length as the number of vertices in the graph.**

The code initializes an empty deque object `q`. The other variables (`ver`, `graph`, and `vis`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
