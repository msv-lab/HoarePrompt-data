Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given the constraints. However, none of the functions defined in the code are relevant to solving this specific problem.

To solve this problem, you would need to focus on the combinatorial aspect of forming triangles within a polygon. Specifically, you need to calculate how many triangles can be formed using the given vertices and the additional vertices that can be chosen. This involves understanding that a polygon with \(n\) sides can be divided into \(n-2\) triangles. Given the constraints, you need to maximize the number of triangles by optimally choosing the additional vertices.

Here is a simplified approach to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate the total number of triangles that can be formed in an \(n\)-sided polygon**: This is \(n-2\).
2. **Subtract the number of triangles that can be formed using the initially chosen vertices**: This requires checking if the chosen vertices can form triangles among themselves.
3. **Add the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen**: Since \(y = 0\) in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen.

Given these points, the solution should directly compute the maximum number of triangles based on the initial number of vertices and the constraints provided.

Since the provided code does not implement any of these steps, the correctness of the program is **False**.
