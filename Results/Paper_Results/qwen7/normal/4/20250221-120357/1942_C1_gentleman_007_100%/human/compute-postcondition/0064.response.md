Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (`ver`) have been visited (`vis[node] == 1` for all reachable nodes), and the queue `q` is empty. The visitation status `vis[node]` is `1` for all nodes that were initially reachable from `ver`, indicating that the entire connected component of the starting node has been processed.

In this final state, the loop has fully traversed the graph starting from the initial vertex `ver`, marking all reachable nodes as visited and ensuring that no further iterations are possible since the queue `q` is now empty.
