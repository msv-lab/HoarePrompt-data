You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a string representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, b is a list of integers representing the vertices that can be used to form diagonals, and y is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.
def func_22(a, b):
    dp = [([0] * (len(b) + 1)) for _ in range(len(a) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(a) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until `i` reaches `len(a) + 1` and `j` reaches `len(b) + 1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `len(a) + 1`, `j` will be `len(b) + 1`, and the `dp` table will be completely filled. Each cell `dp[i][j]` will contain the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the first `i-1` elements of list `a` and the first `j-1` elements of list `b`. Specifically, `dp[len(a) + 1][len(b) + 1]` will hold the length of the LCS of the entire strings `a` and `b`. All other cells in the `dp` table will reflect the lengths of common subsequences up to the indices `i-1` and `j-1` of lists `a` and `b`, respectively.
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` and `j` are both zero, and `l` is a list containing elements from `a` that correspond to the path traced by decrementing `i` and `j` according to the conditions inside the loop until both `i` and `j` reach zero.
    #
    #In more detail, the loop continues to run as long as both `i` and `j` are non-zero. Each iteration of the loop either decrements `i` and/or `j` based on the comparison of `dp[i][j]` with its neighboring cells (`dp[i][j - 1]` and `dp[i - 1][j]`). The list `l` accumulates elements from `a` corresponding to the indices where `i` was decremented. Once both `i` and `j` become zero, the loop terminates, leaving `i` and `j` as zero and `l` as the final list constructed during the loop's execution.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the reversed string 's' which is formed by joining the elements of list 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: a string `a` and a list of integers `b`. It returns a reversed string formed by joining the elements of a list `l`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the reversed string 's' which is formed by joining the elements of list 'l'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
