### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the `func_1` function step-by-step to ensure it correctly computes the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is set to the value of the cow at position `k`.
   - `ind` is initialized as an empty list to store indices where `a[i] > x`.
   - `c` is initialized to 0 to count the number of such indices.

2. **Loop through the list `a`**:
   - For each index `i`, if `a[i] > x`, the index `i` is added to `ind`, and `c` is incremented.
   - The loop breaks if `c` reaches 2, meaning we have found two indices where `a[i] > x`.

3. **Post-loop conditions**:
   - If `ind` is empty, the cow at position `k` is the weakest, so it can potentially win all other cows except the strongest one. Hence, the function returns `n - 1`.
   - If `ind` has exactly one element, we need to consider specific conditions:
     - If the single index in `ind` is 0, the cow at position `k` can win all cows before it, so it returns `k - 1`.
     - If the single index in `ind` is greater than `k`, the cow at position `k` can win up to the index in `ind`, so it returns `ind[0] - 1`.
     - Otherwise, the cow can win either up to the index in `ind` or up to position `k`, so it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
   - If `ind` has more than one element:
     - If the first index in `ind` is 0, the cow can win up to the second index in `ind` minus 1, or up to position `k` minus 1, so it returns the minimum of these two values.
     - If `k` is greater than the second index in `ind`, the cow can win either up to the first index in `ind` minus 1 or up to the difference between the second and first index in `ind`, so it returns the maximum of these two values.
     - Otherwise, the cow can win either up to the first index in `ind` minus 1 or up to position `k` minus the first index in `ind`, so it returns the maximum of these two values.

Given the detailed analysis, the function correctly handles all scenarios and computes the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
