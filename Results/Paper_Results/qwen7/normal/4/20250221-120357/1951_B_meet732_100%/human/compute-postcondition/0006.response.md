Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `x` is an integer, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`; `ind` is a list with the element `i` appended.**

Explanation: The line `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ind`. Since `i` is an index within the list `a` and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`, the only change is that `ind` now contains the value of `i`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
