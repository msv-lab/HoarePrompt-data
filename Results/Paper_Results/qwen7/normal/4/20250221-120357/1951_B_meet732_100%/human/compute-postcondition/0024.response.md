Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `c` is increased by 1, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `c` is further increased by 1 and the index `i` (which is `n`) is appended to the list `ind`.
