Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `c` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`. `ind` now contains the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ind.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ind`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `ind` now contains `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
