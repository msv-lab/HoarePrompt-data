Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` such that 1 <= k <= n. It returns n - 1 in Case_1, k - 1 in Case_2, 1 less than the index stored in `ind[0]` in Case_3, the maximum value between k - ind[0] and ind[0] - 1 in Case_4, the minimum value between the second smallest index in the list `ind` minus 1 and the value of `k` minus 1 in Case_5, the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]) in Case_6, and the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]) in Case_7.**

This means the function `func_1` takes a list `a` of distinct integers and an integer `k` within a specific range. Depending on certain conditions involving the list and the integer `k`, it returns different values as specified in the cases.
