Postcondition: `ind` includes exactly one index where `a[i] > x`, `c` is the size of `ind` which is now 1, `n` remains the same list of integers, `a` remains unchanged, and `x` is the value of the `k-th` element of `a` (where `k` is the position of `x` in the original list `a`). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0, and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.
