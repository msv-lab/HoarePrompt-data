Output State: **The program returns n - 1**

Given the initial state, `ind` includes all indices `i` where `a[i] > x`, and since `ind == []` (an empty list), no indices meet the condition `a[i] > x`. The value of `c` is the size of `ind`, which is 0. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the value of the `k-th` element of `a`. The code simply returns `n - 1`, so the output state is the value of `n - 1`.
