Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `c` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and the index `i` is appended to the list `ind`. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, `c` is increased by 1 and `i` is appended to `ind`. Otherwise, the values of `c` and `ind` remain unchanged.
