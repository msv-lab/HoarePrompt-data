Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the k-th element of list `a`.**

In this case, the code assigns the k-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The values of `a` and `k` remain unchanged, and now `x` holds the value of the k-th element of the list `a`.
