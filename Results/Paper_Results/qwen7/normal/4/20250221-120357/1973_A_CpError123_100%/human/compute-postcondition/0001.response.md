State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable used for iterating over the range of `t`. It does not affect the condition for the loop to execute.
- The variable `t` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- The dummy variable `_` starts at 1 when the loop begins, as the `range(t)` function generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is within the specified range, and `_` is set to 1 to start the loop iteration.
