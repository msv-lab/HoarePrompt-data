Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. It then checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. For each valid set of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, and `y` as `a + b`. It prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
