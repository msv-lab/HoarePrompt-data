Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking for Consistency:**
   - The program checks if `(a + b + c) % 2 == 0`. This condition ensures that the total points scored by all three players combined is even. This is necessary because each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in a draw).
   - If this condition fails, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the total points are not even, it's impossible to achieve those scores through valid games.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the condition passes, the program calculates `x = (a + b + c) // 2`. This value represents half of the total points.
   - It then calculates `y = a + b`. This value represents the sum of the points of the first two players.
   - Finally, it prints `min(x, y)`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of Draw Conditions:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the conditions where the scores can be achieved through valid games involving draws.
   - Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the maximum number of draws can be calculated more accurately by considering the distribution of points among the players.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The current logic `min(x, y)` does not necessarily give the maximum number of draws. For instance, in the case where `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 2`, the program incorrectly outputs `1` (the minimum of `2` and `2`), when the correct answer should be `2`.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly calculate the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:

- Each draw gives 1 point to each player, contributing 2 points in total.
- Each win/loss scenario contributes 2 points in total (2 points to the winner, 0 to the loser).

Given the scores `a`, `b`, and `c`, we need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are achievable.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Total points
        total_points = a + b + c
        # Total wins (each win contributes 2 points)
        total_wins = (total_points - (c - a - b)) // 2
        
        # Maximum possible draws
        max_draws = min(total_points // 2 - total_wins, c - a)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws in calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
