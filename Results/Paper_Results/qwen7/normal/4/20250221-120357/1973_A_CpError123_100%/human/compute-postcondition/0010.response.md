Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, `y` is `a + b`.**

The code `y = a + b` assigns the value of `a + b` to the variable `y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
