Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, `y` is `a + b`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to their respective integer inputs from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `_`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user, while `t`, `_`, `x`, and `y` retain their original relationships and values.
