Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` rounded down, `y` is `a + b`, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even; `y` is now the value of `a + b`**.

In this case, the code simply reassigns the value of `y` to be the sum of `a` and `b`, which was already defined in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
