Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd or even.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (as explained in the problem statement).
   - If `n` is even, it prints "YES" and constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters using the pattern "AB".
3. The constructed pattern ensures that every character (except the first and last) is special since it alternates between 'A' and 'B'.
4. The pattern construction logic is correct and will produce a string of length `2 * (n // 2)` which is always at most 50 (since `n` is at most 50).

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
