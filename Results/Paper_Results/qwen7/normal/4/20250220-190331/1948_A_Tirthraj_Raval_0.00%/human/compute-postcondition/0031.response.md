Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B'.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - The condition `i < n // 2` must still hold true. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be at least 4 (because `2 < 4 // 2` is false, but `2 < 4 // 2` would be true if `n` were 4 or more).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` must be at least 4.

6. **Final state**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B'.

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B'**.
