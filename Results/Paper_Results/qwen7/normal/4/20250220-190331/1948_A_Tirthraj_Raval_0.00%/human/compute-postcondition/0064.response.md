Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and then generates a pattern consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
