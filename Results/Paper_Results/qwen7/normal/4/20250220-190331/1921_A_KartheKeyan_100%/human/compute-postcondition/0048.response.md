Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(4):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 4.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `res` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and it ranges from 0 to 3, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`res`, `x`, `y`, and `coord`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop condition.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**
