Output State: **`x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing two tuples ((x, y), (x, y)), `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `coord` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `x` and `y` are updated to the new integer values from the input, while `coord` remains as a list containing two tuples with the original values of `x` and `y`, and `i` stays as 4.
