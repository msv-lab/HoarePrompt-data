Output State: **`t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed; `s` is the sum of \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\) for each test case; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, and `coord`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
