Output State: `i` is 4, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)).

This means after the loop executes all 4 iterations, the variable `i` will be 4 (as it ranges from 0 to 3 inclusive), `x` and `y` will be the integers from the fourth input split, `coord` will contain four tuples, each being a pair of `(x, y)` from each iteration of the loop.
