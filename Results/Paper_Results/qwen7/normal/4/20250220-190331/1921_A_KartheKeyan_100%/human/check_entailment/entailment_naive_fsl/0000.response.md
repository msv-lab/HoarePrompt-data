Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used in the program seems to be attempting to find the distance between two points and then multiplying these distances to get the area, which is incorrect. For a square, the area should be calculated using the length of one side squared. 

The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and multiplies the square roots of these distances, which does not give the correct area for a square. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```

The correct area of this square is 4, but the program will output a different value because it incorrectly calculates the distances and then multiplies them. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
