Output State: **`x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing three tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y)), `i` is 4**.

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples. After appending the new tuple, `coord` will contain three tuples, each being `(x, y)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
