State: **`res` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be 3** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must iterate through the values generated by `range(4)`, which are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Since `n` is used as the stop parameter in `range(n)`, it must be set to 3 for the loop to generate the correct range of values (0 to 3).
- The variable `res` is not directly involved in the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, its initial value is given for context.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 0 and `n` being set to 3.
