Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `res` is defined as `sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2)`.
     - `p1` is given as `0`.
     - `p2` is defined as `((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)²`.
       - `x` and `y` are input integers from the third and fourth splits, respectively.
       - `sorted(x, y)` returns a tuple with the smaller value first and the larger value second. Therefore, `((sorted(x, y))[0] - 1)² + ((sorted(x, y))[1] - 1)²` simplifies to `(min(x, y) - 1)² + (max(x, y) - 1)²`.

2. **Substituting Values:**
   - Since `p1` is `0`, `sqrt(p1)` is `sqrt(0)`, which is `0`.
   - For `p2`:
     - Let's assume `x` and `y` are such that `x <= y` without loss of generality.
     - `sorted(x, y)` would return `(x, y)`.
     - Therefore, `p2 = (x - 1)² + (y - 1)²`.

3. **Calculating `res`:**
   - `res = sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2) = 0 * sqrt((x - 1)² + (y - 1)²) = 0`.

4. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet is `print(round(res))`.
   - Since `res` is `0`, `round(res)` is also `0`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **0**
