Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns whether the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Note: Although the function signature does not explicitly list parameters, the problem description indicates that it processes multiple test cases, each with four pairs of coordinates.
