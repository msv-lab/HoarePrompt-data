Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element, `p1` is the sum of squares of differences between the second and first tuple's coordinates**.

Explanation: The code calculates the Euclidean distance squared between the first and second points in the sorted list `coord`. Since `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element, `coord[0]` and `coord[1]` represent the first and second points respectively. The calculation `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2` computes the squared difference of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of these two points and stores the result in `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
