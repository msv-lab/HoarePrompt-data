Output State: `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)), `i` is 4.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (4 times), `x` and `y` will be the integers from the fourth input split, `coord` will be a list with four tuples each being `(x, y)`, and `i` will still be 4 as the loop variable `i` in the `range(4)` function does not change during the loop's execution.
