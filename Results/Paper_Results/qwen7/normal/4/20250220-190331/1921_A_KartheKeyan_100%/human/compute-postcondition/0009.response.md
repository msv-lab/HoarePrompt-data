Output State: **`x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing one tuple (`x`, `y`), `i` is 4**.

This means that the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the integers obtained from the second input split, while `coord` now contains a tuple of these two new values. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 4.
