Output State: `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the fourth split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (`x`, `y`), (1, 1), (1, 1), and (1, 1).

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (from 0 to 3), the variable `i` will be 3, indicating the last iteration. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the third input split. The list `coord` will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of integers input by the user during the four iterations of the loop.
