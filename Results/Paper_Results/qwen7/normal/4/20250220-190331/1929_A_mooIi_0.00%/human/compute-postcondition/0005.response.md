Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the for loop. This means that the loop will run based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input integer (let's call it `k`) is a positive integer. Since the loop is driven by `int(input())`, the loop will execute one more time if `int(input())` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `t` will be updated to the new value of `int(input())`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The variable `ar` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` is now the new value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer.
- `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `ar` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.**
