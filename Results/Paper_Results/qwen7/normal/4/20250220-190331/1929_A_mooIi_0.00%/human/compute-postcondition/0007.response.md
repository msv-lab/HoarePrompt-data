Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` and the list `ar` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), and `ar` remains a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.
