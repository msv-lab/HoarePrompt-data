Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the given program simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at the beginning and the smallest at the end, and then alternate between the largest remaining elements and the smallest remaining elements. This way, the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will be maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        # Calculate the maximum beauty
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += ar[n - 1 - i] - ar[i]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            max_beauty += ar[n // 2]
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty according to the optimal arrangement.
