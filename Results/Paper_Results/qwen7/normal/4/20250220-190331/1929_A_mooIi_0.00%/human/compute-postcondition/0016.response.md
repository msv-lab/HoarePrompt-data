Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function does not return a value directly but processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns results for each test case.**

Note: Since the exact operation inside the function is not specified in the problem statement, the functionality focuses on the input processing rather than the output or return value specifics.
