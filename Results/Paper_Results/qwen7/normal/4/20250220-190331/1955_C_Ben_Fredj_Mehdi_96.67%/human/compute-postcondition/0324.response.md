At which points in the program could such an exception occur?
- An `IndexError` can occur if `g` or `d` is out of the bounds of the list `a`. This would happen if `g` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of `a`, or if `d` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the length of `a`.

Summarizing what the try except statement accomplishes:
- The `try` block attempts to decrement the elements at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. It also checks if these decremented values are 0 and adjusts the indices `g` and `d` accordingly.
- If an exception occurs (specifically an `IndexError`), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last element (a[d]) is decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, and if `a[g]` is 0, the value of `a[g]` remains unchanged. If an IndexError occurs, the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
