Output State: **`a` is a list where the element at index `d-1` is reduced by 1, `i` is `m + 1`, and `k` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. This affects the element at index `d` in the list `a`, making it the element at index `d-1`. The other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged.
