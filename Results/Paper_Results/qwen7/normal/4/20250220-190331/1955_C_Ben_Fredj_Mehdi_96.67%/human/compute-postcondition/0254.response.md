Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `z` is 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers converted from the input.
   - `d` is the length of list `a` minus `k`, where `k` is 0. So, `d = len(a) - 0 = len(a)`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input.
   - `g` is the maximum index where `a[g]` is greater than 0.
   - If `k % 2 == 1`, then `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. Since `k` is 0, `k % 2 == 0`, so `a` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a.count(0))
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's consider the key aspects:

- The value of `a` depends on the input, but since no specific input is provided, we need to reason about the general case.
- `g` is the maximum index where `a[g]` is greater than 0. This means `a[g]` is the last non-zero element in the list `a`.
- Since `k` is 0, `a` remains unchanged, and `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1` if `k % 2 == 1` does not apply here.

The `count(0)` function counts how many times the value `0` appears in the list `a`.

Given the general nature of the problem without a specific input, we cannot determine the exact number of zeros in `a`. However, we know that the count of zeros will depend on the input provided.

Thus, the output will be the count of zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **a.count(0)**
