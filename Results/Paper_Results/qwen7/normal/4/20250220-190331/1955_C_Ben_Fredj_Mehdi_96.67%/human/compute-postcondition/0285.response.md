Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is the input string, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `z`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `a` now holds the input string provided by the user, which can be split into `n` and `k` based on the first space in the string.
