Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 4, `i` is 2, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 3, `g` is 3, `a[g]` is now a specific integer that is one less than its original value, `a[d]` is now a specific integer that is one less than its original value.**

Explanation: The line `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. Initially, `g` was 2, so after executing this line, `g` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
