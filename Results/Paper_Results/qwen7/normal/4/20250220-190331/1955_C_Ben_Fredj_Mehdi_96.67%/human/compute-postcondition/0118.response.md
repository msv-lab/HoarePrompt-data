Output State: **`a[d]` is 0, `a[g]` is either 0 or non-zero, `d` is `d-1`, and if `a[g]` was 0, then `g` has been incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `a[d]` is already 0, so decrementing it by 1 does not change its value (it remains 0). The variable `d` is decremented by 1. The condition `if a[g] == 0` checks whether `a[g]` was 0 before the decrement of `d`. If it was 0, then `g` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
