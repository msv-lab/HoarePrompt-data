Output: **0**

Explanation: The initial state provides that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, and `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`. However, the `print` statement only outputs the string `'0'`. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, and `k`, the output will be the string `'0'`.
