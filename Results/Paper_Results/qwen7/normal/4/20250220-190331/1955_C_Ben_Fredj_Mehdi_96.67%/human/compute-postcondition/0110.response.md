Output State: **`a[d]` is the value of `a[d]` reduced by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` takes the current value of `a[d]`, converts it to an integer (though it's already an integer in this context), and then reduces it by 1. Since the initial state says `a[g]` is the value of `a[g]` reduced by 1, this does not affect `a[d]`. Therefore, the only change is that `a[d]` is now its original value minus 1.
