Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- The conditions are such that `n` is not equal to 1, `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, `a[0]` is not equal to 1, and `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
- The current value of `k` is explicitly stated to be 199999999999999.

The print statement is:
```python
print('199999999999999')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'199999999999999'`.

Output: **199999999999999**
