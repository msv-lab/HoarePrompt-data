Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `k` is not equal to 9999999999.
- `a[0]` is not equal to 1.
- `(n != 101 or k != 100000000000)`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('10000')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'10000'`. The values of other variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`) are not relevant to this specific print statement.

Output: **10000**
