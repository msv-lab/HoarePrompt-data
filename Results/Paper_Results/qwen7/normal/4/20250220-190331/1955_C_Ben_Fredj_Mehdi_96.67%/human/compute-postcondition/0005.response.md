Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input from the user, splits it into substrings using a space as the delimiter, converts each substring to an integer, and stores them in a list. The original values of `t` and `z` remain unchanged. The string `a` is now a list of integers, where the first element corresponds to the integer before the first space in the input, and the second element corresponds to the integer after the first space.
