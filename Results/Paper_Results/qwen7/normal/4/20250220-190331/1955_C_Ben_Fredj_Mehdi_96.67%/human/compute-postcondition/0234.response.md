Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is `d - 1`, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is 3, `a[d]` is -1, `a[g]` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `k // 2`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `a[d]` equals 0, then `d` is decremented by 1. The other variables retain their values as specified in the precondition.
