Output State: **`a` is a list where the element at index `d` is reduced by 1, `i` is `m + 2`, and `k` remains the same.**

The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` reduces the element at index `d` in the list `a` by 1. The value of `i` is unchanged and is still `m + 2`. The value of `k` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
