Output State: **`a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`**

Explanation: The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` updates the value of `a[d]` to be one less than its current integer value. Similarly, `a[g]` was already defined as `int(a[g]) - 1` in the initial state, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are as described.
