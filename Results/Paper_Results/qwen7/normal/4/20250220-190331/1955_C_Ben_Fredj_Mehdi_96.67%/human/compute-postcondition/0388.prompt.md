Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4; n and k are not yet defined, and a is still an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers. If `k` is 1999999998, then `k` is set to 1999999998. Otherwise, `k` is either 1999999999, 99999999999, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, an even number decremented by 1 with adjustments to indices `g` and `d`, an odd number decremented by 1, or remains unchanged based on its value relative to the sum of all elements in `a`. `n` remains as the original first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input. If `n` equals 1 and `k` equals 10000000000000 and the first element of `a` is 1, then the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition. If `n` does not equal 1 or `k` does not equal 10000000000000, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition. If `n` equals 101 and `k` equals 100000000000, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition. If `k` equals 10000000000000, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition. If `n` equals 2 and `k` equals 2147483648, then `k` is set to 1000000000 and `a` becomes `[1000000000, 1000000000]`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `n` remain the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, and `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`. If `k == 1999999998`, the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are each decreased by 1, `i` is set to `k // 2 - 1`, `d` is set to the length of `a` minus `k // 2`, and if `k` is odd, `a[k // 2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `k` is 9999999999, 10000000000000, 5999999999, 4294967295, or 3000000000, `t`, `z`, and `a` remain unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
