Postcondition: **The list `a` has been modified by decrementing each element at indices `g` and `d` by 1 for every iteration of the loop until `i` reaches `k // 2`. If an element at index `g` or `d` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. The loop breaks if an exception occurs during any iteration. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.**
