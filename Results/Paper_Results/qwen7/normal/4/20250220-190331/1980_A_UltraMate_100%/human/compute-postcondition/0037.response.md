Given the initial state:
- `i` is 'G'
- `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
- `ans` is equal to `3 * m`

However, the value of `m` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Since `m` is not defined or given a specific value, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. Therefore, the expression `3 * m` will remain as it is, representing three times the value of `m`.

Output: **3 * m**
