Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
4. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a`.
5. It iterates over each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') and checks if the required number of problems (`m`) for each difficulty level is met. If not, it adds the difference to `ans`.
6. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
