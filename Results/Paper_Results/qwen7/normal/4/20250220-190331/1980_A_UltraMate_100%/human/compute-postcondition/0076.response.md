Output State: **`i` is 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is 3 * m, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `i`, `p`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The values of `n` and `m` are specifically the integers input by the user.
