Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`, which is `'ABCDEFG'`. This means `i` will take on each value from `'A'` to `'G'` in sequence.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with the first character of `p`, `i` should be set to `'A'` initially.

4. **Determine the state of `p`**: The variable `p` is explicitly defined as the string `'ABCDEFG'`.

5. **Check if the loop will execute**: Given that `p` is a non-empty string and contains characters, the loop will definitely execute because there are characters to iterate over.

6. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to the first character of `p` for the loop to start executing correctly. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `ans`, and `hmp`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `'A'`
- `p` should be `'ABCDEFG'`

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `'A'`, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`**
