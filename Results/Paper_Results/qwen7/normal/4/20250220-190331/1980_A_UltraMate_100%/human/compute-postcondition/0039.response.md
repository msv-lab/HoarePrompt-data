Output State: **`i` is 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is equal to `3 * m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second to `m`. The values of `i`, `p`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions and values of `t` are also unaffected.
