Output State: **`i` is 'G', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`**.

The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a `Counter` object named `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
