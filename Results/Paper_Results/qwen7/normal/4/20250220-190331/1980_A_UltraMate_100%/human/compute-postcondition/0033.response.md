Output State: **`i` is `next_next_i`, `ans` is `ans + (m - hmp[i])` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` remains `m - hmp[next_i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. The condition `if hmp[i] < m` determines whether the new value of `ans` should include this addition. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged as `m - hmp[next_i]`. The value of `i` remains `next_next_i` as no operation was performed on it.
