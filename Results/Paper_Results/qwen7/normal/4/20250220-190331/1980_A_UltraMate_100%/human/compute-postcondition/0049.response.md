Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'G'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
   - The postcondition states that if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`. The loop condition is based on the variable `i`.

3. **Current Iteration**: In the current iteration, `i` is 'G'.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in the string `p`. The next character after 'G' in the string 'ABCDEFG' is 'H'.

5. **Adjusting States**: We need to update the state such that `i` becomes 'H'. The other variables (`p`, `ans`, and `hmp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Postcondition Check**: Since the postcondition involves checking if `i` is not in `hmp`, and `i` is set to 'H' (which is not specified in `hmp`), the postcondition will hold true if it was true before, and `ans` will be updated accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 'H', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m` if `i` ('H') is not in `hmp`**.
