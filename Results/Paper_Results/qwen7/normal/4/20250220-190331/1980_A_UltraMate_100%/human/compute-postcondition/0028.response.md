Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in hmp:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `hmp` that have not been iterated over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 'G'
   - `ans` is set to `m - hmp[i]`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 'G', the next value of `i` would be the next key in the dictionary `hmp`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `hmp` must still contain keys that have not been iterated over.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to the next key in `hmp`.
   - `ans` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was 'G' in the previous iteration, the next key in `hmp` will be used for the next iteration. Let's denote the next key as `next_i`.

6. **New State**:
   - `i` will be `next_i`.
   - `ans` will be set to `m - hmp[next_i]`.

Since we don't know the exact content of `hmp`, we can only express the state in terms of the next key and the calculation for `ans`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `next_i`, and `ans` is set to `m - hmp[next_i]`**
