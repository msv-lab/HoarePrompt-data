Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 'B'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
   - The postcondition states that if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in p:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `p`. Since `i` was 'B' in the previous iteration, the next character in `p` is 'C'.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will now be 'C'.
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEFG' because it is the iterable and does not change within the loop.

6. **Postcondition Consideration**: The postcondition checks if `i` is not in `hmp`. Since this condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, and we don't have information about `hmp`, we cannot determine the value of `ans` or `m` directly from the given information. However, the state of `i` and `p` needs to be updated based on the loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**
