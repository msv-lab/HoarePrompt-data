Based on the initial state provided:

- `hmp` is a dictionary where all keys have been processed.
- `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

Let's break down the calculation of `ans`:

1. For each key `i` in `hmp`, check if `hmp[i] < m`.
2. If true, add `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

The value of `ans` is the sum of these differences for all keys `i` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

Therefore, the `print(ans)` statement will output the computed sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m - hmp[i] for all keys i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m)**
