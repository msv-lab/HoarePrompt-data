Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged**.

This means that the value of `ans` is updated by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it only if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If `hmp[i]` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `ans` remains unchanged. The initial conditions that `i` is the second key in `hmp` and `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m` are preserved, with `ans` being updated accordingly.
