Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 'H'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
   - `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m` since `i` is 'H' and not in `hmp`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.
   - The loop variable `i` takes on each character of `p` in sequence.

3. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 'H'.

4. **Next Character in `p`:**
   - The next character in `p` after 'H' is 'A'.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, `i` will now be set to the next character in `p`, which is 'A'.
   - The state of `p` remains unchanged as it is the iterable itself.
   - The state of `ans` does not change because the operation (adding `m` to `ans`) is only performed if `i` is not in `hmp`. Since `i` is changing to 'A' and we don't know the contents of `hmp`, we cannot assume anything about `ans` changing.

6. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
   - `ans` is the same as its state at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m` since `i` is 'H' and not in `hmp`**.
