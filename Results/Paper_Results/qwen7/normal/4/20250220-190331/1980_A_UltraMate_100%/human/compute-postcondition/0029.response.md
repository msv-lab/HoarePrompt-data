Output State: **`i` is `next_i`, `ans` is `m - hmp[next_i] + (m - hmp[i])`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `m - hmp[next_i]`. After executing the line `ans += m - hmp[i]`, the value of `ans` is updated to its original value plus `m - hmp[i]`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `m - hmp[next_i] + (m - hmp[i])`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was only referenced in the calculation but not reassigned.
