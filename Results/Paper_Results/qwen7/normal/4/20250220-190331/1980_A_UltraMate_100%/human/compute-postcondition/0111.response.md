Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the total sum calculated based on the conditions provided within the loop, considering all inputs given during each iteration of the loop.

To explain further, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all unique characters in the string `s` (as provided in each iteration) where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. If a character does not appear in the string `s` at all, it contributes `m` to `ans`. This calculation happens for every string `s` provided in each iteration of the loop, with `m` being the value of `m` from the last iteration since it is not redefined inside the loop.
