Output State: **`i` is the next character in `p`, `p` is the string `p` without the first character, `ans` is `m + m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`**.

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been updated by adding `m` to its current value, resulting in `ans` being `m + m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
