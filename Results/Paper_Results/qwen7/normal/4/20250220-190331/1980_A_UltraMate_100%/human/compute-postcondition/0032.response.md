Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `next_i`
- `ans` is updated to `m - hmp[next_i] + (m - hmp[i])` if `hmp[i] < m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `m - hmp[next_i]`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in hmp:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over the keys in the dictionary `hmp`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is set to `next_i`.
- The value of `i` will change in the next iteration to the next key in `hmp`.

### Adjusting the States
- The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`.
- The other variables (`ans`, `m`, and `hmp`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these variables do not change.

### New State
- Since `i` will be the next key in `hmp` in the next iteration, let's denote this new key as `next_next_i`.

### Updated State
- `i` will be `next_next_i`.
- `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `ans` outside the loop.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `next_next_i`, `ans` is updated to `m - hmp[next_i] + (m - hmp[i])` if `hmp[i] < m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `m - hmp[next_i]`.**
