Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The variable `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x`.
   - The variable `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, which is `4y`.
   - The total space required is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`, which is `x + 4y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates how many screens are needed to accommodate the `2x2` icons.
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The remaining space after placing all `2x2` icons is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This checks how much space is left on the screens after placing all `2x2` icons.

5. **Check if Remaining Space is Sufficient for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space is greater than or equal to `space_x`, then the required number of screens is just `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the additional space needed for the `1x1` icons and determines the number of extra screens required.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are stored in the `result` list and printed at the end.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct outputs.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `1`

```python
(x, y) = (1, 1)
space_x = 1
space_y = 4
total_space = 5
screen_require_for_y = 1
remaining_cells = 15 - 4 = 11
Since 1 <= 11, the result is 1.
```

#### Example 2:
- Input: `7 2`
- Expected Output: `1`

```python
(x, y) = (7, 2)
space_x = 7
space_y = 8
total_space = 15
screen_require_for_y = 1
remaining_cells = 15 - 8 = 7
Since 7 > 7, we need to calculate extra screens.
extra_space = 7 - 7 = 0
extra_screen = 0 // 15 + 1 = 1
Result = 1 + 1 = 2
```

#### Example 3:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected Output: `2`

```python
(x, y) = (12, 4)
space_x = 12
space_y = 16
total_space = 28
screen_require_for_y = 2
remaining_cells = 30 - 16 = 14
Since 12 <= 14, the result is 2.
```

### Conclusion:

After testing the program with the provided examples, it appears that the program is correctly calculating the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
