Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements**:
   - `space_x = x * 1` correctly calculates the space required for `x` single-cell icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4` correctly calculates the space required for `y` double-cell icons (each taking 4 cells).

3. **Total Space Calculation**:
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x` correctly sums up the total space required.

4. **Determining Screens for Double-Cell Icons**:
   - The logic to calculate `screen_require_for_y` is almost correct but needs some adjustments:
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
   - This part is mostly correct, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of `remaining_cells`.

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` should be adjusted to account for the correct number of cells per screen (which is 15, since each screen is 5x3).
   - The formula should be `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

6. **Checking and Calculating Extra Screens**:
   - The logic to check if `space_x` fits into the remaining cells is correct.
   - However, the way `extra_screen` is calculated needs to be more precise:
     - If `space_x` is exactly divisible by 15, `extra_screen = space_x // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = (space_x + 14) // 15` (using ceiling division).

7. **Appending Results**:
   - The results are appended to the `result` list based on the conditions, which seems correct.

8. **Printing Results**:
   - The results are printed correctly, each on a new line.

Given the analysis, the code logic has a minor mistake in the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the way `extra_screen` is calculated. However, the overall approach and the core logic are correct.

Correctness: **False**

The code needs to be corrected to properly handle the calculation of `remaining_cells` and `extra_screen`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = (space_x + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

With this correction, the code should work as expected.
