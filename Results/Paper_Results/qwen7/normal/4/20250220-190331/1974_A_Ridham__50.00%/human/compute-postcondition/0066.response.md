Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `result` is a list containing the final values computed for each iteration based on the conditions within the loop.
- Each element in `result` is either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as:
  - `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even.
  - `y // 2` if `y` is odd.
- `extra_screen` is determined by the remaining cells and `space_x`.
- `x` is the first integer entered for each iteration.
- `y` is the second integer entered for each iteration.
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as:
  - `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` if `y` is even.
  - `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y` if `y` is odd.

Given these details, the `result` list will contain values based on the calculations above for each iteration. When the `print` statement executes, it will join the elements of `result` into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Output: **the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line**
