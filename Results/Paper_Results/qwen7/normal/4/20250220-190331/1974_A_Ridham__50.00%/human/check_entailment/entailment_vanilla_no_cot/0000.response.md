Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons. Here are the issues:

1. **Space Calculation**: The calculation of `space_x` and `space_y` is incorrect. `space_x` should be `x * 1` and `space_y` should be `y * 4`, but these values are not used correctly in the subsequent calculations.

2. **Screen Requirement Calculation**: The logic for calculating the number of screens required for `y` (2x2 icons) is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that each screen can hold exactly 2x2 icons without considering the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The calculation of `remaining_cells` is incorrect. It should consider the total space available on the screens and the space already occupied by 2x2 icons.

4. **Final Screen Calculation**: The final screen requirement calculation is overly complex and does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the space required for 2x2 icons
        space_for_2x2 = y * 4
        
        # Calculate the space required for 1x1 icons
        space_for_1x1 = x
        
        # Total space available per screen
        total_space_per_screen = 5 * 3
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2  # Each screen can hold at most 2 2x2 icons
        
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space_after_2x2 = total_space_per_screen * screens_for_2x2 - space_for_2x2
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (x + remaining_space_after_2x2 - 1) // remaining_space_after_2x2
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens_needed = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        result.append(total_screens_needed)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of screens correctly by properly accounting for the space required by both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
