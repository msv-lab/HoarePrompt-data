Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list containing one element, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, or `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even, and `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` if `screen_require_for_y` is in `result`, otherwise `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code `space_x = x * 1` simply reassigns the value of `space_x` to `x`. Since `x` was previously set to an input integer, `space_x` now holds the same value as `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
