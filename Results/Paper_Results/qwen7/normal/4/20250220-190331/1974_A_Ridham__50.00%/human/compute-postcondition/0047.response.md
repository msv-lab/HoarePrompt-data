Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered; `space_x` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` to `space_x` by multiplying `x` with 1. Since multiplying any number by 1 results in the same number, `space_x` now holds the value of `x`. The other variables (`n` and `y`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
