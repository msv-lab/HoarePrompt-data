Output State: **`total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_space` by adding `space_y` (which is `y * 4`) and `space_x` (which is `x`). The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, and `space_y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
