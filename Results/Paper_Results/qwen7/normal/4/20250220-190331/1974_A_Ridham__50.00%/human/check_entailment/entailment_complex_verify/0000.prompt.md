You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `result` is a list containing the final values computed for each iteration based on the conditions within the loop. Each element in `result` is either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is even, or `y // 2` if `y` is odd, and `extra_screen` is determined by the remaining cells and `space_x`. `x` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `y` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, and `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` if `y` is even, or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - space_y` if `y` is odd. The final state of `result` will contain the sum of `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` for each iteration of the loop.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates the number of screens required based on specific conditions involving \(x\) and \(y\). If \(y\) is even, the number of screens required is \(y // 2\); if \(y\) is odd, it is \(y // 2 + 1\). It then checks if the available space (\(space_x\)) is sufficient; if not, it calculates the additional screens needed. The function compiles these results into a list and prints each result on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the subsequent logic to determine the number of additional screens needed is flawed.

For example, consider the case where `x = 12` and `y = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to fit 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2 (which occupy 4 cells each). The total number of cells required is \(12 + 4 \times 4 = 28\) cells. Since each screen has 15 cells, we need at least 2 screens to fit all the icons.

However, the program calculates the number of screens required as follows:
- It calculates `screen_require_for_y` as `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, which is correct.
- It then calculates `remaining_cells` as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, but this does not account for the fact that the 2x2 icons already occupy some of the cells, leaving fewer cells available for the 1x1 icons.

Let's break down the calculation for the example `x = 12` and `y = 4`:
- `screen_require_for_y = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since `y` is 4, which is even, we take `y // 2`).
- `space_y = 4 * 4 = 16` (total cells occupied by 2x2 icons).
- `remaining_cells = 15 * 3 - 16 = 39 - 16 = 23` (cells remaining after placing the 2x2 icons).

Since `x = 12` and `remaining_cells = 23`, the program checks if `space_x <= remaining_cells`, which is true. However, the program then incorrectly calculates the number of additional screens needed as `extra_screen = space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x % 15 != 0`, leading to `extra_screen = 12 // 15 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`. Adding these to `screen_require_for_y` gives `result.append(2 + 3) = 5`, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve ensuring that the placement of 2x2 icons does not exceed the available space and correctly calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
