Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has run exactly `n` times. The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` is the exact number of iterations the loop ran. The `result` list contains up to `n` elements, each element being either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions specified in the loop body. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are the integers read from input, `space_x` is set to `x`, `space_y` is set to `y * 4`, and `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`. Depending on the value of `y`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated and added to `screen_require_for_y` before appending to `result`. The `remaining_cells` calculation ensures that the total number of cells required for the screen is adjusted based on the conditions provided.
