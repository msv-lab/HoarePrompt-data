Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not affected by this code.
