Output State: **`ii` is 0, all elements in the list `a` have been processed, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is the last element of the original list `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The other variables (`ii`, `i`, `r`, `rem`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
