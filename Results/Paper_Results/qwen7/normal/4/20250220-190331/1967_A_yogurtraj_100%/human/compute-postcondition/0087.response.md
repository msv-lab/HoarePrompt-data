Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `n` is a value greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is either 0 or has been reduced throughout the iterations.
   - `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   \[
   (r - 1) \times n + 1 + k \% n
   \]

3. **Breakdown of the Expression:**
   - `r` is defined as `a[n-1] + k // n`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`, resulting in an integer.
   - `r - 1` is simply `a[n-1] + k // n - 1`.
   - `(r - 1) * n` multiplies the result of `r - 1` by `n`.
   - `1` is added to the result of the multiplication.
   - `k % n` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n`.

Given that `k` is either 0 or has been reduced throughout the iterations, let's consider both cases:

- If `k` is 0:
  - `r = a[n-1] + 0 // n = a[n-1]`.
  - `(r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n = (a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1 + 0 = (a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1`.

- If `k` is not 0 but has been reduced, it still results in a non-negative integer less than `n` because `k` is reduced through iterations. Therefore, `k % n` will still be a value between 0 and `n-1`.

In both cases, the expression simplifies to a specific form involving `a[n-1]`, `n`, and `k`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers and `a[n-1]` is the last element of the list, and considering the expression, the output will be a specific integer value derived from the formula.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1 + k % n**
