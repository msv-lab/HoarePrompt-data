Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `r` is updated accordingly, and `rem` and `y` are defined as specified in the if part. Specifically, if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k` when `i` is 0, then `r` is set to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1`, `k` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
