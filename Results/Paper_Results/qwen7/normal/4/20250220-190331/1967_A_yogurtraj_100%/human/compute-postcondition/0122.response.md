Output State: **`r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)` and assigns it to the variable `rem`. The value of `r` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Therefore, the output state includes both the unchanged value of `r` and the newly calculated value of `rem`.
