Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `k` is not 0
   - `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 1
   - `ii` is 1

2. **Expression to be Printed:**
   ```python
   (r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - We know `r = a[n-1] + k // n`.
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, `a[n-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`.
   - `k // n` is the integer division of `k` by `n`, which gives the quotient.
   - Therefore, `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the quotient of `k` divided by `n`.

4. **Substitute `r` into the Expression:**
   - The expression becomes `(a[n-1] + k // n - 1) * n + 1 + k % n`.

5. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Distribute `n` inside the parentheses: `a[n-1] * n + k // n * n - n + 1 + k % n`.
   - Since `k // n * n` is `k` (because integer division followed by multiplication returns the original number), the expression simplifies to `a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n`.

6. **Final Simplification:**
   - Combine like terms: `a[n-1] * n + k - n + 1 + k % n = a[n-1] * n + k + k % n`.
   - Since `k % n` is the remainder when `k` is divided by `n`, it is a value between 0 and `n-1`.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to `a[n-1] * n + k + k % n`.

Given this, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **a[n-1] * n + k + k % n**
