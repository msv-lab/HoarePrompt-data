Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. The remainder of any number divided by 1 is the number itself. Therefore, `rem` is `k % 1`, which is `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
