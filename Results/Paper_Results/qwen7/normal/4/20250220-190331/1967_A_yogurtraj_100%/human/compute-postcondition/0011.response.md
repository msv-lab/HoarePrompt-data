Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value of `n - 1 - i`. Given that `i` is 0, `y` becomes `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
