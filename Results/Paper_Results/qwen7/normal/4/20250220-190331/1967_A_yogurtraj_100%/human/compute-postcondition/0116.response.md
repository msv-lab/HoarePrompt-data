Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is decreased by (2 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])**.

Explanation: The code `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Given that `i` is initially 2, the expression `(i + 1)` evaluates to 3. However, since `i` is updated to 1 within the expression due to the decrement operation, `i` becomes 1 after the execution of the line of code. The value of `k` is decreased by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by this line of code and remains valid.
