Output State: **`r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**

The code assigns the value of `n - 1 - i` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `r` and `rem`, which remain as they were initially. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `y` and retains the initial values of `r` and `rem`.
