Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `n` is decreased by 1, `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Since `i` was initially 1, `i + 1` becomes 2, so `r` is now equal to `a[2]`. The values of `k` and `n` are decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `n` is also decreased by 1. The value of `i` is incremented to 2. The initial state of `r` being undefined is no longer relevant since it has been updated.
