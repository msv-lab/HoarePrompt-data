Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ii` is 0.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `n` is a value greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is either 0 or has been reduced throughout the iterations.
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was never met for any `i` in the loop, otherwise, `r` is the element at the position where the condition was last met.
   - `rem` is `n - (n-1) - 1 = 0`.
   - `y` is `0`.
   - The condition `(k != 0)` is false.

2. **Understanding `r`:**
   - Since the condition `(k != 0)` is false, it means `k` must be 0.
   - Given that `r` is determined by the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, and since `k` is 0, the condition simplifies to checking if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > 0`.
   - For a sorted list `a`, the difference between consecutive elements is always positive, so the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > 0` will always be true.
   - Therefore, `r` will be the last element of the list `a`.

3. **Substituting Values into the Print Statement:**
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `n` is a value greater than or equal to 1.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - The expression to print is `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

4. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - Let's assume the last element of the list `a` is `last_element`.
   - The expression becomes: `(last_element - 1) * n + 1 + 0 + 0 = (last_element - 1) * n + 1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `(last_element - 1) * n + 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **(last_element - 1) * n + 1 (where last_element is the last element of the list `a`)**
