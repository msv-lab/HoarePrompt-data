Output State: **`i` is 1, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k`. The only changes are that we indicate that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `r` remains as `a[0] + 0 // 1`, which simplifies to `a[0]`, and `rem` remains 0. The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.
