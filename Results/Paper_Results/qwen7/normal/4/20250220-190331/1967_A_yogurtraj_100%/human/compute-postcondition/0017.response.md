Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `r` is updated accordingly, `rem` is defined, `y` is `n - 1`, and `k` is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise `k` is reduced by the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
