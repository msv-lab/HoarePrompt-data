Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0**.

Explanation: The code sets `k` to 0. All other variables retain their initial or calculated values from the initial state.
