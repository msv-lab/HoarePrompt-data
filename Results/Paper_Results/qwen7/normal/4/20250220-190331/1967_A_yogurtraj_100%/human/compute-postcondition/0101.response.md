Output State: **`i` is 0; `r` is `a[0] + k // (0 + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (0 + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. The remainder of any number divided by 1 is the number itself. Therefore, `rem` is `k % 1`, which is `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
