Output State: **`i` is 1; `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is `k % 1`; `y` is `n - 1 - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The values of `r` and `rem` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given line of code. The expression `n - 1 - i` is evaluated to `n - 2`, and `y` is assigned this value.
