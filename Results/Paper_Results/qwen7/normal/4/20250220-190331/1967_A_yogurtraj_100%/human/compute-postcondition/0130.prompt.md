Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ii` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either 0 or has been reduced throughout the iterations, `r` is `a[0]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If the condition is true, then `k` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, and `n` remains greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, and other variables are set as follows: if `i` is 2, then `r` is `a[2] + 0 // 3`, `rem` is `0 % 3`, and `y` is `n - 1 - 2`. If the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true, `k` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `i` becomes 1, and `k` is decreased by `(2 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, while `r` is set to `a[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false. If the condition is true, `r` is set to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
