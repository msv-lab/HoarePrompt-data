The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)`.

State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**
