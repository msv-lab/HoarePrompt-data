Postcondition: **`same` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` starting from `ar[0]` up to the last element processed, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is the current number being tracked, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution, and `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations and moved past the last index of the list. `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the current value of `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either equal to infinity or the length of the list `ar`**.
