Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 6**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
