Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is increased by 1, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`**.

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the same as `ar[i]`. Since `i` was previously increased by 1, `ar[i-1]` was equal to `num` before this line of code. Now, `num` is updated to be `ar[i]`, which means `num` is now equal to `ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
