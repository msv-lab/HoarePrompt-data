You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Postcondition: `same` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` throughout the entire list, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final input integer after all iterations, `ar` is the final list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the current number being tracked, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution, and `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations and moved past the last index of the list. `minn` is the smallest value of `same` found during the loop, and it is either equal to infinity or the length of the list `ar` in the if part, or `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar` in the else part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `num` to track the current element.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements (`minn`).

3. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The loop correctly identifies sequences of identical elements.
   - `minn` is updated to store the minimum length of such sequences.
   - If `minn` is infinite (`inf`) or equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for identifying the minimum sequence length is correct.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when the array is already uniform) is appropriate.
   - The final check to ensure the array cannot be made non-beautiful if `minn` is infinite or equal to the array length is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
