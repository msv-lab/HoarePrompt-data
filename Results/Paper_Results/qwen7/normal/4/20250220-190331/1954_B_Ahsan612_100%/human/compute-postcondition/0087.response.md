Output State: **`same` is between 1 and len(ar)-1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to len(ar), `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the current value of `same`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `minn`.
