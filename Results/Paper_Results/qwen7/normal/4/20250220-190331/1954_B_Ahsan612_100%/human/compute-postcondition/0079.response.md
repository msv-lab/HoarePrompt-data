Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[i]`, `minn` is 2, `i` is `i + 1` and is less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to `ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and it is still less than the length of the list `ar`.
