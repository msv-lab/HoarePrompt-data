Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now the value of `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, and `i + 1 < len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `i + 1 < len(ar)` also remains true since `i` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, and the length of the list `ar` does not change.
