You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `same` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar` throughout the entire list, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final input integer after all iterations, `ar` is the final list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the current number being tracked, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop's execution, and `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations and moved past the last index of the list. `minn` is the smallest value of `same` found during the loop, and it is either equal to infinity or the length of the list `ar` in the if part, or `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar` in the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. Based on these inputs, the function determines if the array a meets certain criteria and returns a result accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
