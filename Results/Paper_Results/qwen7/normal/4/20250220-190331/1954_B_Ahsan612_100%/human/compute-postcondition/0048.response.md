Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: We need to consider the state of the variables at the start of the loop, based on the given postconditions.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `same`: This variable remains unchanged within the loop and is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `t`: This variable is not mentioned in the loop head, so it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `n`: This variable remains unchanged within the loop and is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `ar`: This list is not modified within the loop head, so its state remains the same.
   - `num`: This variable is not mentioned in the loop head, so it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `minn`: This variable is updated within the loop, but since we are considering the state at the start of the loop, we need to determine its value before the update.
   - `i`: This variable is set to `len(ar)` at the start of each iteration, so it will be updated to the length of the list `ar`.

Given the information, the only variable that changes at the start of each iteration is `i`, which is set to the length of the list `ar`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `same` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ar` remains the same.
- `num` remains the same.
- `minn` remains the same.
- `i` is set to the length of the list `ar`.

Since the list `ar` and its elements (`num` and `minn`) are not directly modified in the loop head, their values remain the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, and `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`**.
