Output State: `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `same` will hold the value of the minimum consecutive count of the same elements found in the list `ar`, starting from the second element. The variable `minn` will be updated to reflect the minimum value between the first two elements of the list `ar` and the `same` value after the loop completes. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`) retain their initial or updated values as described in the previous iterations.
