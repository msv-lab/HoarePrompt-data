The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is incremented by 1 (let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`)
- `i_new = i + 1`

For the loop to continue, `i_new` must be less than `len(ar)`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i + 1 < len(ar)`.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]`, and `i + 1 < len(ar)`**
