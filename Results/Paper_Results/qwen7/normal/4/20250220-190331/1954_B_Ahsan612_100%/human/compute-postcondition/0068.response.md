Output State: **`same` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 5**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
