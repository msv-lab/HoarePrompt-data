Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` updates the value of `i` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `same` remains 1, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, `n` remains an input integer, `ar` remains a list of integers, `num` remains `ar[0]`, `minn` remains infinity, and `i` changes to 1.
