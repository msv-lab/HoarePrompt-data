### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of elements `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to count consecutive identical elements and `num` to track the current element.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements (`minn`).

3. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The loop correctly identifies sequences of identical elements.
   - `minn` is updated to store the minimum length of such sequences.
   - If `minn` is infinite (`inf`) or equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for identifying the minimum sequence length is correct.
   - However, the program does not actually check if removing the identified sequences would make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it simply prints the length of the shortest sequence of identical elements.
   - For the array to stop being beautiful, there must be at least two different elements in the array. If the array consists of only one unique element, removing any sequence of that element will not change the fact that the array remains beautiful.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum sequence length is 1 (the first '1'), but removing this '1' does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining elements are still alternating between 1 and 2.
   - Similarly, for the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the minimum sequence length is 3 (any segment of 3s), but removing these 3s does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining elements are still alternating between 3 and 5.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that finding the minimum sequence length is sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - The program fails to account for the fact that the array can only stop being beautiful if there are at least two different elements present after removal.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only finds the minimum sequence length of identical elements, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Final:
**False**
