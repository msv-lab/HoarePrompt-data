Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is 2, `i` is 7 if the condition `ar[i] == num` is false, otherwise `same` is 3 and `i` remains 5.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial value of `i` is 6 if the condition `ar[i] == num` is false, and it remains 5 if the condition is true. After incrementing, if the condition was false, `i` becomes 7. If the condition was true, `i` remains 5, but since `same` is 3 in this case, no change in `same` is mentioned. All other variables remain unchanged.
