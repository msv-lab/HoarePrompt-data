Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while i < len(ar)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `same` is either 3 or 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers.
   - `num` is now `ar[0]`.
   - `minn` is 2.
   - `i` is 7 if the condition `ar[i] == num` is false, otherwise `same` is 3 and `i` remains 5.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 7.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. This means `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure it is less than `len(ar)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[0]`, `minn` is 2, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**.
