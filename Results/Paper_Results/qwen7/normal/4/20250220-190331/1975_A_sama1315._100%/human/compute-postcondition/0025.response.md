Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is int(data[11]), `idx` is 14 + int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index idx + n and of length n, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a)**.

Explanation: The line `result = func_1(a)` assigns the return value of `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t`, `n`, `idx`, `a`, and `results` retain their previous values, and `result` is updated to the return value of `func_1(a)`.
