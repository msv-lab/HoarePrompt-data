Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is int(data[11]), `idx` is 14 + int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index idx + n and of length n, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a), `results` is updated to include the new element result**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(a)`) to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the `results` list.
