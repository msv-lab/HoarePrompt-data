Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index 10 and of length `n`, `idx` is 11, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)` and `results` has an additional element which is `result`.**

In this case, the code snippet appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`, the list `results` now contains one more element, which is `result`. All other variables remain unchanged.
