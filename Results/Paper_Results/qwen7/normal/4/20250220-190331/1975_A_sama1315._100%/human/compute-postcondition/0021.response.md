Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index 10 and of length n, `idx` is 12, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[11]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The index `idx` is updated to `idx + 1`, which is now `12`.
