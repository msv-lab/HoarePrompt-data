Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index 10 and of length n, `idx` is 13, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a)**.

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 12, so after executing this line, `idx` becomes 13. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
