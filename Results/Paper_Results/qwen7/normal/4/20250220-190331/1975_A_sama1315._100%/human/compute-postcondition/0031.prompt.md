You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is int(data[11]), `idx` is 14 + int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index `idx + n` and of length `n`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 since it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 in each iteration. The final value of `idx` will be 14 plus the value of `n` (which was determined in the third iteration) because `idx` is incremented by `n` at the end of each iteration. The value of `a` will be the last list of integers extracted from `data` based on the final value of `idx` and `n`. The `results` list will contain the results of applying `func_1(a)` to each list `a` processed during the loop's iterations.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of func_1(a) for each iteration, separated by newlines
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables t (an integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 50), and a (a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6). It returns a value based on these predefined variables.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
