Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is int(data[11]), `idx` is 14 + int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index `idx + n` and of length `n`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 since it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 in each iteration. The final value of `idx` will be 14 plus the value of `n` (which was determined in the third iteration) because `idx` is incremented by `n` at the end of each iteration. The value of `a` will be the last list of integers extracted from `data` based on the final value of `idx` and `n`. The `results` list will contain the results of applying `func_1(a)` to each list `a` processed during the loop's iterations.
