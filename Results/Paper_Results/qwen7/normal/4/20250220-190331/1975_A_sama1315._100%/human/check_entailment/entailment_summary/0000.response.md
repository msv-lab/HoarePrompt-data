Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze both `func_1` and `func_2` in the context of the problem description.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The goal is to check if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - The key insight is that if the array can be split and swapped in such a way that it becomes non-decreasing, there must exist a point in the array where the elements from that point onwards are in non-decreasing order and the elements before that point are in non-increasing order.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` checks if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by finding a subarray in the concatenated array that matches the sorted version of the original array.
   - However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and swapping the array. Instead, it checks if the array can be rearranged into a sorted form by simply looking at substrings of the concatenated array, which is not equivalent to the allowed operation of splitting and swapping.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` reads input data and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Since `func_1` is flawed as explained above, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
