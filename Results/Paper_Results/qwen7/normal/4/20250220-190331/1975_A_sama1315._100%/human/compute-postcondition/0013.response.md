Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50
   - `a` is a list of n integers where each element `a_i` is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1
   - `idx` is 8
   - `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`n`, `a`, `idx`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element `a_i` is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1, `idx` is 8, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**
