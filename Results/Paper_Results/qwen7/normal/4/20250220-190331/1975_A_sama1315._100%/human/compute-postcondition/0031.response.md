Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases (determined by the value of `t`) where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1(a)` to compute a result, collects these results in a list, and finally prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value directly but modifies the global variables `t`, `n`, `idx`, and `a` as it processes the input data.**
