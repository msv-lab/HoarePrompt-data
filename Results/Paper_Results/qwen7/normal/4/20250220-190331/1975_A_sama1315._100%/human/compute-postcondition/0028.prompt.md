Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer from the list `data` at index 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
    idx += n
    result = func_1(a)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1, `idx` is 8, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index 10 and of length `n`, `idx` is 11, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)` and `results` has an additional element which is `result`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is int(data[11]), `idx` is 14 + int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index idx + n and of length n, `results` is a list containing the result of func_1(a) plus the new element result, `result` is the return value of func_1(a), `results` is updated to include the new element result




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
