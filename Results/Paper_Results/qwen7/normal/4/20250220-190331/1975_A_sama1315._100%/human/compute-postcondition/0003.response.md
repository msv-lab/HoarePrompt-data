Output State: **`t` is an integer from the list `data` at index `idx`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `idx` is 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from the list `data` at the current index `idx` to the variable `t`. Since `idx` was initially 0, after executing the line `t = int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
