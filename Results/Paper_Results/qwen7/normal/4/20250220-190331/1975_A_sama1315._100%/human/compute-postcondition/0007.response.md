Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `n` and converts it to an integer. Initially, `idx` is 2, so `data[idx]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `data`. After executing the code, `idx` is incremented by 1 (since list indices are zero-based), making `idx` equal to 3. The value of `t` and the list `a` remain unchanged, and `results` remains an empty list.
