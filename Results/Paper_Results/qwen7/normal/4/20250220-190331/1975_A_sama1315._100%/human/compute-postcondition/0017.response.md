Output State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is int(data[8]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from index 10 and of length `n`, `idx` is 11, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)` plus the new element `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by `n`. Since `n` is `int(data[8])`, `idx` becomes `10 + int(data[8])`, which is `11`. All other variables remain unchanged.
