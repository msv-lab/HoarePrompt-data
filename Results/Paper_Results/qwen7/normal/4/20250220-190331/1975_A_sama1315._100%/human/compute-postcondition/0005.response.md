Output State: **`t` is an integer from the list `data` at index 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
