### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Let's break down why:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if there exists a way to split `a` into two parts such that concatenating them in reverse order results in a sorted array.
   - Specifically, it concatenates `a` with itself and then checks if any substring of this concatenated array matches the sorted version of `a`.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to split the array and swap parts. Instead, it only checks if the entire array plus itself contains a subarray that is sorted, which is not sufficient.

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
   - The function `func_1` would concatenate this array with itself to get `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
   - It then checks if any substring of this concatenated array matches the sorted version `[1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]`.
   - However, this approach fails to recognize that the array cannot be made non-decreasing through the allowed operations. For instance, splitting the array into `[1, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]` and swapping them does not result in a non-decreasing array.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - While the input handling is correct, the core logic in `func_1` remains flawed as explained above.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
