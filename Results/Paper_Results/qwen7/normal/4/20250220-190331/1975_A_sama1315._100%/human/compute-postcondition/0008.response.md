Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `idx` is 4, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `results` remain unchanged.
