Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is equal to the corresponding elements in `data` from index 8 to 8 + n - 1, `idx` is 8, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(a)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

The code `result = func_1(a)` assigns the return value of `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `results` is updated to include this return value. All other variables retain their initial states.
