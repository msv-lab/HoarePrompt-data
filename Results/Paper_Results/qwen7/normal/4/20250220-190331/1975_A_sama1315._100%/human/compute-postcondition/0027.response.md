Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is int(data[11]), `idx` is 14 + int(data[11]), `a` is a list of integers extracted from data starting from index idx + n and of length n, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

In this final state, `t` has been decremented to 0 after the loop completes its iterations. The value of `n` is determined by the integer at index 11 of the `data` list. The `idx` variable points to the position right after the last processed list `a`. The `a` list contains integers extracted from the `data` list based on the current value of `n` and the current value of `idx`. The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.
