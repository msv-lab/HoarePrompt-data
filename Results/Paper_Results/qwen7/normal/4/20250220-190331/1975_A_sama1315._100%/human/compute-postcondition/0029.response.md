Based on the initial state and the operations described:

- `t` starts at 0 and remains 0 throughout the loop since it is decremented by 1 in each iteration but starts as 0.
- `n` is set to `int(data[11])`, which is a specific integer value derived from the `data` list.
- `idx` is initially set to `14 + int(data[11])`, and it is incremented by `n` at the end of each iteration of the loop.
- `a` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `idx + n` and of length `n`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.

Given that `t` starts at 0 and never changes, and considering the loop's behavior, the `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(a)` applied to different slices of `data` as `idx` and `n` change with each iteration.

However, without knowing the exact number of iterations or the specific values of `data`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `results`. But we know that `results` contains the outputs of `func_1(a)` for each iteration.

Therefore, the print statement will output the results of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, formatted as a newline-separated list.

Output: **the results of func_1(a) for each iteration, separated by newlines**
