Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 9, `i` is 0.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop increments `res` by \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) in each iteration. Starting from `i` being 9, the loop continues until `i` reaches 0. Given that the initial value of `res` is 204 and the loop adds values based on the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\), after 9 iterations (from `i` = 9 to `i` = 0), `res` remains 204 because no further additions are made once `i` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `res` is still 204, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 9, and `i` is 0 since the loop has completed all its iterations.
