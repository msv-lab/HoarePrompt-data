Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `n-2`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `'1 %d' % i`: This part formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 1.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n+1` into individual arguments for the print function.

4. **Determine Values**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 4. Therefore, `i = n - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.
   - If `n` is 4, then `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The formatted string `'1 %d' % i` with `i = 2` becomes `'1 2'`.
   - The unpacked range `*range(1, n + 1)` becomes `1 2 3 4`.

6. **Combine the Parts**:
   - The print statement combines these parts into a single output: `'1 2' 1 2 3 4`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 2 1 2 3 4**
