Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The given program initializes a matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to `n` for each row, which means the matrix will look like:
   ```
   1 2 3 ... n
   1 2 3 ... n
   ...
   1 2 3 ... n
   ```
3. The sum of all elements in such a matrix is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \cdot n = n \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
4. The program calculates this sum using the formula \( \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \), which simplifies to \( n \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
5. The program then prints this result along with \( 2n \), indicating that it uses exactly \( 2n \) operations.
6. The operations printed are of the form:
   - Type 1: Setting the entire \( i \)-th row to the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - Type 2: Setting the entire \( i \)-th column to the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

Given these points, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum and performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
