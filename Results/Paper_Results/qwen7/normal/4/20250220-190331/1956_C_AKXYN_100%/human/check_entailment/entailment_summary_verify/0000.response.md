### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- There are two types of operations:
  1. Type 1: Permute the rows.
  2. Type 2: Permute the columns.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it initializes a square matrix `mat` of size \( n \times n \) with values ranging from 1 to \( n \).
- It calculates a result `res` using a specific formula involving \( i \) and prints this result along with \( 2n \).
- It then prints a sequence of commands involving the matrix `mat` for each value of \( n \) from \( n \) down to 1.

#### Analysis:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row. This means:
     ```python
     mat = [
         [1, 2, 3, ..., n],
         [1, 2, 3, ..., n],
         ...
         [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
     ]
     ```
   - This initialization ensures that each row is identical, and each element in the matrix is unique within its row but not across rows.

2. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result `res` is calculated using the formula:
     ```python
     res = sum((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i in range(n))
     ```
   - This formula does not directly relate to the problem's goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix elements through permutations.

3. **Operations**:
   - The program prints a sequence of operations for each value of \( n \) from \( n \) down to 1:
     ```python
     for i in range(n, 0, -1):
         print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
         print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
   - Each operation is a permutation of the entire row or column, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Initialization**: The matrix is correctly initialized with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
- **Operations**: The operations printed do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. They simply permute the rows and columns, which does not ensure the maximum possible sum.
- **Result Calculation**: The result `res` is calculated using a formula that does not relate to the problem's goal of maximizing the sum through permutations.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix within the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. The operations it prints are unnecessary and do not achieve the desired result.
