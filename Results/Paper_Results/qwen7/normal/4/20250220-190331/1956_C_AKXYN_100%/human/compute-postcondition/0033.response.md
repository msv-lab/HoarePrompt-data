Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, `n` must remain the same or be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `res` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 but can be any value greater than or equal to 3.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `mat` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`res` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**
