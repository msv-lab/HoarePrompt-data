Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` is explicitly given as 204.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). Since no specific value for `t` is provided, we don't need to consider it for the print statement.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`, which is 3. So, this part becomes `'2 3'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object from 1 to `n + 1`, where `n` is 3. This results in the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Combining the Parts**:
   - The formatted string `'2 3'` is combined with the unpacked range `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - The output will be a single line of text combining these parts.

Final Output:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3**
