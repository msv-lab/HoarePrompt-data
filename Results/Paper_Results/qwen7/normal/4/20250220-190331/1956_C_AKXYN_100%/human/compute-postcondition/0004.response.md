State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to n, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the loop head (`for i in range(n)`).
2. The loop condition depends on the variable `n`, which determines the number of iterations.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
4. No adjustments are needed for `res` or `t` as they are not involved in the loop initialization.
5. `mat` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.
6. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the other variables remain as stated.
