Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement is `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**:
   - `'1 %d' % i`: This part formats the string `'1 %d'` with the value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, it becomes `'1 %d' % 0`, which results in the string `'1 0'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into separate arguments. The range `range(1, n + 1)` generates numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Given `n` is 2, this becomes `range(1, 3)`, which generates the numbers `[1, 2]`. Unpacking this range gives `1` and `2` as separate arguments.
   - Combining these, the print statement effectively becomes `print('1 0', 1, 2)`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - When the print statement `print('1 0', 1, 2)` is executed, it will print the string `'1 0'` followed by the numbers `1` and `2` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **1 0 1 2**
