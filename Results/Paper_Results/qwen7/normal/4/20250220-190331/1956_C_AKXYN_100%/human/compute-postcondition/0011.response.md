Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is equal to `n`.

To calculate the final value of `res`, we observe the pattern in the given loop. The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and in each iteration, it adds `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`. We can sum up these terms from `i = 0` to `i = n-1` to find the total value of `res` after all iterations.

For `n = 4` (since the loop has executed 3 times so far, it will execute one more time to complete the full cycle):

- When `i = 0`, `res += (0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1`
- When `i = 1`, `res += (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 6 - 1 = 6`
- When `i = 2`, `res += (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 15 - 6 = 15`
- When `i = 3`, `res += (3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 28 - 15 = 28`
- When `i = 4`, `res += (4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 63 - 28 = 204`

Thus, after all iterations, `res` is 204. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `mat`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
