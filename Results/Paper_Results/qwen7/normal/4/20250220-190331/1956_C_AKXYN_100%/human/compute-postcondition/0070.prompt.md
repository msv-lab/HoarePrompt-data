Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is 4; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 30.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`. Given `n` is 2, the loop will run twice. Let's calculate the value of `res` step-by-step:

1. **First iteration (i = 0):**
   \[
   res += (0 + 1) \times (2 \times 0 + 1) = 1 \times 1 = 1
   \]
   So, `res` becomes 1.

2. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   \[
   res += (1 + 1) \times (2 \times 1 + 1) = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]
   Adding this to the previous value of `res`, we get:
   \[
   res = 1 + 6 = 7
   \]

Since the loop runs twice, `i` will be incremented to 2 after the loop completes. However, the problem statement asks for the final state of the loop, which means after the loop has fully executed its iterations. Therefore, `i` will be 2 + 1 = 3, but the question specifically asks for the state after all iterations, so `i` will be 4 as per the loop's final increment.

The other variables (`n`, `mat`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states because they are not modified within the loop. Thus, the final state is `i` is 4; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 7 + 18 = 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `n` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 0, `n` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
