### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
2. Two types of operations are allowed:
   - Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
   - Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.
3. The sum of the matrix should be maximized.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This initializes the matrix `mat` with each row being a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). For example, for \( n = 2 \), the matrix would be:
   ```
   [[1, 2],
    [1, 2]]
   ```

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   This calculates a sum based on a formula, but it does not reflect the actual sum of the matrix. Instead, it seems to be a placeholder or a misunderstanding of the problem.

3. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(res, n << 1)
   ```
   This prints the calculated sum (`res`) and \( 2n \), which is the maximum number of operations allowed. However, `res` is not the actual sum of the matrix.

4. **Operations:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   This part of the code prints out operations for both types 1 and 2, but they do not actually change the matrix to achieve the maximum sum. Instead, it prints the same permutations repeatedly, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Sum Calculation:** The sum calculation (`res`) is incorrect and does not reflect the actual sum of the matrix.
- **Operations:** The operations printed do not change the matrix to achieve the maximum sum. They simply print the same permutations repeatedly, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix within the specified constraints. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the matrix and instead prints unnecessary operations.
