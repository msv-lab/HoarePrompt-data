Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a matrix (a list of lists) named `mat`. Each inner list contains integers ranging from 1 to `n`, and there are `n` such inner lists. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
