Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 144.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). However, this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. Again, the exact value of `n` is not needed for the current print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as `n`.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. This value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```

Here, `res` is explicitly given as 144. The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the binary representation of `n` one position to the left, effectively multiplying `n` by 2.

Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, let's denote `n` as some value \( n \geq 3 \). The expression `n << 1` will then be \( 2n \).

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **144, 2n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 3)**
