Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is 2
- `n` is 2

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 2
   - `n` is currently 2

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - Since `i` is now 1, the loop will continue to execute because it will run from 2 down to 1 (inclusive).

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We only need to adjust the state of `i` because it is the variable being modified within the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not being modified within the loop.

### Updated State
- `i` is now 1
- `n` remains 2

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 2**
