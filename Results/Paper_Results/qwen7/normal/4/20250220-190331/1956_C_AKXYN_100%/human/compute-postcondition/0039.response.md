Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `'2 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 2. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this part of the string will be `'2 n'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into separate arguments. This means it will print all numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, let's consider a specific example where `n = 3` (the minimum value).

- If `n = 3`, then `i = 3`.
- The string `'2 %d' % i` becomes `'2 3'`.
- `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3]`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
```
2 3 1 2 3
```

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3**
