Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still satisfy the condition \(n > 0\).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`res` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**
