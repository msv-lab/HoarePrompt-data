Output State: `i` is 0; `n` is 1; `mat` is [[1]]; `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given that `n` is initially set to 1, the loop will run only once with `i` starting from 1 and decrementing to 0. During this single iteration, the value of `res` is not modified, so it remains 0. The matrix `mat` is initialized as a list containing a single list `[1]` since `n` is 1. After the loop completes, `i` will be 0, `n` will be 1, `mat` will be `[[1]]`, and `res` will be 0.
