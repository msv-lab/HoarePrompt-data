Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `s` is a set containing `arr[i + 2]`, `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i]`**

Explanation: The code adds `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contains `arr[i + 2]` and `arr[i + 1]`. After adding `arr[i]` to `s`, the set `s` now contains `arr[i + 2]`, `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i]`. The conditions `i < n` and the nature of `s` as a set (which does not allow duplicate elements) remain unchanged.
