Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, the list `s` is a sorted version of the set containing all elements from the list `arr` with 0 at the beginning, and `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the initial conditions of the other variables.
