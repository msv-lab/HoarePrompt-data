Output State: **`i` is within the range [2, n-2], `n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `ans` is the opposite of its original value, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` toggles the value of `ans`. If `ans` was originally 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The conditions involving `i`, `n`, `s`, and the comparison `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` remain unchanged.
