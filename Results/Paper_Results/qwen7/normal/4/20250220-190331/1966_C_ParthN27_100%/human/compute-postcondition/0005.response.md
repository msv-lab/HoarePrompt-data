Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is a non-negative integer; `s` contains `arr[0]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the first element of the list `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`) is added to the set `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
