Output State: **`i` is less than `n` and equal to `n-1`; `s` is a set containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`), and the set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr`.
