Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; `ans` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i` or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `i` and `s`, and introduces the new value of `ans`.
