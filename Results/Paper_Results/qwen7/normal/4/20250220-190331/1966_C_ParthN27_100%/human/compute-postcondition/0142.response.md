Postcondition: **`i` is within the range `[n-2, n-2]`, `n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and the first element of `s` is 0; `ans` is 0.** 

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` will be `n-2`, `n` will be at least 3, `s` will be a sorted list containing all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` with the first element being 0, and `ans` will remain 0. The value of `ans` will stay 0 regardless of whether the condition inside the if statement is true or false because the if part sets `ans` to 0 and the else part does not change `ans`.
