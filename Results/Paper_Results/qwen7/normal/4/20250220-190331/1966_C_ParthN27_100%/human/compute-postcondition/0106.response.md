Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `s` is a set containing `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition `i < n` must still hold true for the next iteration.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Set the New State**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `s` will now contain `arr[(i + 1) + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`, which simplifies to `arr[i + 2]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is less than `n`, `s` is a set containing `arr[i + 2]` and `arr[i + 1]`**.
