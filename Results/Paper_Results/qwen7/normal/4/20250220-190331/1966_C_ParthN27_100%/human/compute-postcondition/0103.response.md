Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` is less than `n`, the index `i` is within the bounds of the list `arr`. The set `s` did not exist before, so it is initialized with the element `arr[i]`. The conditions that `i` is less than `n` and `n` is an input integer remain unchanged.
