Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `s` contains `arr[0] + arr[1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must still be a non-negative integer and `i` (now 2) must be less than `n`.

5. **State the new state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `s` contains `arr[0] + arr[1]`**
