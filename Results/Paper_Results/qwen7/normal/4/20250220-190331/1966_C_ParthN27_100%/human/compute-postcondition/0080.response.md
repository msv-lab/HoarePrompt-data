Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `s`, `i`, or `n`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the program will break out of the implied context, which is described in the output state.
