Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`; `n` is a non-negative integer; `s` is a list containing the sorted sum of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `s` now contains the sorted sums of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.
