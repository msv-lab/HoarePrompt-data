Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a non-negative integer; `s` contains `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the element `arr[2]` is added to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contained `arr[0] + arr[1]`. After adding `arr[2]`, `s` now contains `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
