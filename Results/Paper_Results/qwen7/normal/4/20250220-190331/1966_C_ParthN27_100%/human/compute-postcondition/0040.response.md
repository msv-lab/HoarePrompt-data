Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2. The variable `ans` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was ever met for any `i` in the range from 1 to `n-2`. If the condition was never met, `ans` remains 1. If the condition was met at least once, `ans` is flipped to 0.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `ans` will be 0 if the difference between consecutive elements in the list `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) was ever greater than 1 during the loop's execution. Otherwise, `ans` will remain 1.
