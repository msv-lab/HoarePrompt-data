Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `s` is an empty set.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting value) and `n` should be a non-negative integer (since `range(n)` will not include `n` itself).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` should be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer**
