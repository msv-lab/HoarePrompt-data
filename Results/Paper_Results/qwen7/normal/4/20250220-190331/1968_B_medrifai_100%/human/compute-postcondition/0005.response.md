The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and `i` and `j`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b). 

If the binary string `b` contains the character at index `i` of `a` starting from index `j` in `b`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`. Otherwise, it returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the character at index `i` of `a` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is not found, it returns -1.**
