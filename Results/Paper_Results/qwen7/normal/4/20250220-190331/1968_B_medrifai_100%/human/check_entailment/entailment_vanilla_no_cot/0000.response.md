Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`, starting from the current position `j`. If found, it updates the indices and continues checking. The loop terminates when either the end of one of the strings is reached or no more matches are found. The final count `c` gives the required length `k`. The implementation matches the problem description accurately.
