Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The main loop iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, followed by the strings themselves.
3. It initializes three variables: `i` (index for string `a`), `j` (index for string `b`), and `c` (count of matching characters).
4. It uses a helper function `func_1` to find the next character of `a` in `b` starting from index `j`.
5. If the character is found, it increments both `i` and `j` and increases the count `c`.
6. If the character is not found, it breaks out of the loop.
7. Finally, it prints the count `c`.

The helper function `func_1` correctly searches for the character at index `i` of string `a` within the substring of string `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence relative to `j`. If not found, it returns `-1`.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program should work as intended according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
