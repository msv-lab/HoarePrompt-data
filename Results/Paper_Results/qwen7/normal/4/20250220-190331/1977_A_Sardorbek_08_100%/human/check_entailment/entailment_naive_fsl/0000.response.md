Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes), or if `b` is less than `c`. However, it fails to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves and the desired number of cubes properly.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`. According to the problem description, it should be possible to achieve this by making 5 moves: adding 1 cube four times and removing 1 cube once. However, the program incorrectly prints 'No' because `b % 2 != c % 2`.

To fix this, the program should check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, since each pair of add and remove operations results in a net change of zero cubes. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program works for all valid cases as described in the problem statement.
