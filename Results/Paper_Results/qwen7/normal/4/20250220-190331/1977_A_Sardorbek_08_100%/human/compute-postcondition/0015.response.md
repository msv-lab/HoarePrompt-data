Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is an integer.
- `c` is an integer.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- The current value of `b` modulo 2 is equal to the current value of `c` modulo 2.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
