Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `a` is an input integer; `i` is 3; `b` is the first input integer; `c` is the second input integer; `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**

Explanation: The code `q = b, c` assigns the values of `b` and `c` into a tuple and assigns it to the variable `q`. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
