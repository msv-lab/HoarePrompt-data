Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Case where `b` (number of moves) is greater than `c` (number of cubes):**
   - The program checks if `b == c` and prints 'YES' if true.
   - It also checks if `b < c` and prints 'NO'.
   - However, it should allow `b > c` as long as the difference between `b` and `c` is even because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the total difference must be even.

2. **Case where `b` and `c` have the same parity:**
   - The program checks if `b % 2 == c % 2` and prints 'Yes' if true.
   - This condition alone is not sufficient. The difference between `b` and `c` must also be even.

To fix this, the program should check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This version correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement.
