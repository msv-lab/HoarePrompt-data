Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `a` is an input integer; `i` is 3; `b` is the first input integer; `c` is the second input integer; `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**

Explanation: The if condition checks whether `b % 2 == c % 2`. Both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the if condition, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
