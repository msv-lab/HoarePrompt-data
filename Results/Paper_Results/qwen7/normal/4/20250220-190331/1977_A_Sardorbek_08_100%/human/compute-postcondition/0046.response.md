Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\); `a` is an input integer; `i` is equal to `a`; `b` is the first input integer; `c` is the second input integer; `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a` because the loop runs from `0` to `a-1`, inclusive. Therefore, after `a` iterations, `i` will be `a`. The values of `b` and `c` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `q` will hold this last pair as a tuple. All other variables remain in their initial or updated states as per the loop's execution.
