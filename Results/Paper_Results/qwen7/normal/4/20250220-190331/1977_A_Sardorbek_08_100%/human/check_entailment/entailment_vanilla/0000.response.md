Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `0` to `a-1`.

2. **Reading Test Case Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` (separated by a space) using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - These integers represent the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` in the tower.

3. **Conditions for Output**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes), it prints 'YES'. This is because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired result.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'. This is because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves since each move can only add or remove one cube.
   - If `b` is greater than `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'YES'. This is because the parity of the number of moves and the number of cubes must match. If they do, it means the number of additions and removals can balance out to leave `c` cubes.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `3 3`
   - `b = 3`, `c = 3`
   - Since `b == c`, the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

2. **Test Case 2**: `2 4`
   - `b = 2`, `c = 4`
   - Since `b < c`, the output should be 'NO'.
   - The program correctly outputs 'NO'.

3. **Test Case 3**: `5 3`
   - `b = 5`, `c = 3`
   - Both `b` and `c` are odd, so the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly outputs 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
