You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. Based on the values of `b` and `c`, it prints one of four possible responses: 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's not impossible to have more cubes than moves; it just means that the number of cubes cannot be greater than the number of moves without removing cubes, which is not allowed.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is also incorrect because it does not fully cover all scenarios where it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves. For example, if `b = 3` and `c = 1`, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` would fail, but it's still possible to achieve this by adding one cube and then removing two cubes.
   - The default case prints 'No', which is incorrect because it doesn't handle all possible valid scenarios.

### Correct Conditions:
- To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves, we need to check:
  - If `b >= c`: It's always possible to end up with `c` cubes by adding `c` cubes and possibly removing excess cubes.
  - If `b < c`: It's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the conditions. The corrected program should be as shown above.
