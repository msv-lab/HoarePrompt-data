### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `b` and `c` which represent `n` and `m` respectively.
   - It checks if `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes). If they are equal, it prints "YES". This is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube at a time to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints "NO". This is correct because it is impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves available.
   - The condition `if b % 2 == c % 2:` is intended to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes. However, this condition is unnecessary and incorrect. The key point is whether the total number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes, not just the parity. For example, if `b` is even and `c` is odd, it is still possible to achieve `c` cubes if `b` is sufficiently large (e.g., `b = 2` and `c = 3`).

3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Loop Execution**: The loop correctly iterates over all test cases and processes each one independently.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is flawed due to the unnecessary and incorrect parity check. However, the overall structure and handling of the test cases are correct. The program would produce the correct output if the parity check is removed.

### Correctness:
**False**
