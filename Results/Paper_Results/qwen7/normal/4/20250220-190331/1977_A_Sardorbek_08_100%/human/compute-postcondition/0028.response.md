Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` modulo 2 equals `c` modulo 2.

The key point here is the print statement itself:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'`. The values of other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`) do not affect this specific print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **YES**
