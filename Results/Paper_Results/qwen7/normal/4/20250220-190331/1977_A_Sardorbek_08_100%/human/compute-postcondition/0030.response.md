Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 2.
- `b` is equal to `c`.
- If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains less than `c`.
- If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` modulo 2 equals `c` modulo 2.

Given these conditions, the only thing being printed is the string `'Yes'`.

Since no other variables or values are being printed, the output will simply be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
