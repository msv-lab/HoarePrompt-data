Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `v` is a list of integers entered by the user, converted from a space-separated string input, and `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` if the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd. Otherwise, `result` remains unchanged.
