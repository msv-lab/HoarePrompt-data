Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `v` is a list of integers entered by the user, converted from a space-separated string input**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a space-separated string input from the user and converts it into a list of integers. The variable `t` is not affected by this operation, so its value remains as `t - 1`. The variable `v` is updated to be a list of integers based on the user's input.
