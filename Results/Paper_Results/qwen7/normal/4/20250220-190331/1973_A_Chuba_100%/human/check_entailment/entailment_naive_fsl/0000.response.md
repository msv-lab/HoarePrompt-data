Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The logic in the program does not account for the possibility of draws among different pairs of players. Specifically, the program only checks if the total sum of points is even and then calculates the number of draws based on the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores. This approach fails to consider the constraints and possibilities of draws among different pairs.

For example, consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, the scores could be achieved with two draws (one between the first and second player, and one between the second and third player), but the program incorrectly prints `-1` because it does not properly handle the distribution of draws among different pairs of players.
