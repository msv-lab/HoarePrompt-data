Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each test case and checking if the sum of the scores \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, indicating an inconsistency. If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula \((p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - \max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2\).

However, the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is incorrect. The formula should consider the total points distributed among the three players and ensure that the points can be split into wins, losses, and draws correctly. Specifically, the correct approach should involve ensuring that the total points (which is always even) can be distributed in a way that respects the constraints of the game.

To fix this, we need to check if the sum of the scores is even and then determine if the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins, losses, and draws. The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of draws would involve ensuring that the difference in scores can be balanced out by the number of draws.

Given the provided code, the logic to determine the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the distribution of points among wins, losses, and draws.

Correctness: **False**
