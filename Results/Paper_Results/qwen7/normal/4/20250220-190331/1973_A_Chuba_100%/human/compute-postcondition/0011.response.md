Output State: **`t` is decreased by 1; `v` is a list of integers entered by the user, converted from a space-separated string input.**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a space-separated string input from the user and converts each element into an integer, storing them in the list `v`. The variable `t` is decreased by 1 but its specific new value is not provided, so we only note that it has been decreased. The initial state of `v` being a list of integers entered by the user remains valid and is updated to reflect the conversion from string to integer.
