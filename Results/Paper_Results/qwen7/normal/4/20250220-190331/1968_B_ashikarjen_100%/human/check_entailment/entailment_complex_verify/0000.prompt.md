You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `k` is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the condition `b[j] == a[i]` was met for any `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the final value it was set to after the loop, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, and `j` is the final value it was set to after the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `k` will be incremented each time the character `a[i]` is found in the string `b` up to index `m-1`. If `a[i]` is found for any `i` in the range of `n`, `k` will be greater than 0; otherwise, it will remain 0. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The value of `n` and `m` will be the final values they were set to after the loop completes. The variables `a` and `b` will retain their input values, and `j` will be the final value it was set to after the loop exits.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is 0 if no characters from a are found in b within the specified range, and greater than 0 if at least one character from a is found in b)
    return
    #The program returns k which is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the condition b[j] == a[i] was met for any i in the range of n, t which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n which is the final value it was set to after the loop, m which is the final value it was set to after the loop, a which retains its input value, b which retains its input value, and j which is the final value it was set to after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two binary strings, `a` and `b`, of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It counts the number of times a character from string `a` is found in string `b` within the first `m` characters. The function returns the count (`k`), the original value of `t`, the final value of `n` after processing, the final value of `m` after processing, the original string `a`, the original string `b`, and the final value of `j` after processing. If no characters from `a` are found in `b`, `k` is 0; otherwise, `k` is greater than 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. 

The issue lies in the way the indices `i` and `j` are incremented. Specifically, after finding a matching character `a[i]` in `b`, the index `j` is incremented twice (`j += 1` inside the if block), which skips a character unnecessarily. This can lead to missing valid subsequences.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
5
5 4
10011
1110
3 3
100
110
1 3
1
111
4 4
1011
1111
3 5
100
11010
3 1
100
0
```

Expected Output:
```
2
2
1
1
3
0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
2
1
1
3
0
```

The program incorrectly increments `j` twice when a match is found, which can cause it to miss valid subsequences. For instance, in the first test case, the program should find that the prefix "10" of `a` is a subsequence of `b`, but it only finds "1", which is incorrect.

To fix this, the inner loop should increment `j` only once after finding a match. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        k = 0
        j = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
                j += 1
            if j < m:
                k += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                break
        print(k)
        return
```

This corrected version ensures that `j` is incremented only once per match, allowing the program to correctly find the maximum prefix length `k`.
