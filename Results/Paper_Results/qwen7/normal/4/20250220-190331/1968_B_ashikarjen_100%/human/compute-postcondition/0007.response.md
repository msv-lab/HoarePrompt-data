Output State: **`k` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, `j` is 1, and `b[0] != a[i]`**.

The variable `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
