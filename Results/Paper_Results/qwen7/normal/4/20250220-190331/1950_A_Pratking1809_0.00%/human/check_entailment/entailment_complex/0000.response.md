Reasoning:
- The program correctly defines the function `func()` which processes multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
- It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
- If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
- The logic for checking the conditions is correct.
- The function does not return anything explicitly, but it prints the results directly, which is appropriate for the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the program appears to be functioning as intended.

Correctness: **True**
