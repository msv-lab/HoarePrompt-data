You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user. If `a < b < c`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, the conditions `a < b > c` or `b` is not greater than `c` hold true for each iteration of the loop. The variable `mn` remains 100 as it is not affected by the loop.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, `q` will be a positive integer indicating the number of iterations, `i` will be equal to `q` (the total number of iterations), and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `mn` will remain unchanged at 100 since it is not involved in any operations within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` is equal to `c`. According to the problem description, if `a < b == c`, it should still be classified as a "NONE" case. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify such cases as "STAIR" or "PEAK".

For example, consider the input `1 5 5`. Based on the problem description, this should be classified as "NONE", but the current program will incorrectly classify it as "STAIR" because it checks `a < b < c` first, which fails, then it checks `a < b > c` which also fails, but since it doesn't handle the equality case properly, it might mistakenly classify it as "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of the checks.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check for the equality case before classifying it as "STAIR" or "PEAK". Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This ensures that all potential cases are handled correctly according to the problem description.
