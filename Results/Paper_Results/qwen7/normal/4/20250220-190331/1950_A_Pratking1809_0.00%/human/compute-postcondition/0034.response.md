Functionality: **The function reads multiple sets of three integers (a, b, c) from the user, each set within the range 0 to 9. For each set, it checks if a < b < c, in which case it prints 'STAIR'. If a < b > c, it prints 'PEAK'. Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function does not return anything (None).**
