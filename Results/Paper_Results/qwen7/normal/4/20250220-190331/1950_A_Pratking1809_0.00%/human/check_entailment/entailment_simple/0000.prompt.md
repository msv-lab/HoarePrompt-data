Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user. If `a < b < c`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, the conditions `a < b > c` or `b` is not greater than `c` hold true for each iteration of the loop. The variable `mn` remains 100 as it is not affected by the loop.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, `q` will be a positive integer indicating the number of iterations, `i` will be equal to `q` (the total number of iterations), and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The variable `mn` will remain unchanged at 100 since it is not involved in any operations within the loop.
