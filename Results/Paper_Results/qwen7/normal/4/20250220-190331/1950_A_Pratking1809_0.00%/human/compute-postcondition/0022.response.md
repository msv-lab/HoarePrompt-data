Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user.
- The condition `a < b > c` holds true, or `b` is not greater than `c`.

Regardless of the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (as they are determined by user input), the print statement is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement will always print the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **'NONE'**
