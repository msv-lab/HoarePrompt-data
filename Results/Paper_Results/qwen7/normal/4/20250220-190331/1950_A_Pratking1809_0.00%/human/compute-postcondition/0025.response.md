Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` depend on the user's input, but their types and the conditions they satisfy (either `a < b > c` or `b` is not greater than `c`) are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, these values are left as user inputs.
