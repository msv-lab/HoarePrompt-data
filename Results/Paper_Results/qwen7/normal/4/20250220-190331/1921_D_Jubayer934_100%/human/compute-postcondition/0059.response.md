Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended with the absolute difference of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is `i`.**

Explanation: The line `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `temp`. Since `i` was previously `n + 1`, `temp` now holds the value `n + 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
