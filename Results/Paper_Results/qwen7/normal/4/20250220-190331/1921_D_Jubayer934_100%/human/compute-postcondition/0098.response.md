Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp - 1]` and `b[temp - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `temp = i` assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, `temp` is now equal to `i`, and `ans` retains its initial state with one additional element being the absolute difference between `a[temp - 1]` and `b[temp - 1]`.
