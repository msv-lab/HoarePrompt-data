Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list of the first `n` sorted integers entered by the user, `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code takes a sequence of integers as input, splits it into individual integers, converts them to integers, sorts them in descending order, and then takes the first `m` elements from this sorted list. The original `n` and `m` values, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is created and contains the `m` largest integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
