Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `temp` is equal to `i`.
   - `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `temp` will now be equal to the new value of `i`, which is `i + 1`.
   - `ans` will have one additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.

Based on these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`**.
