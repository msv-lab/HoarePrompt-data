Output State: **`ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n-1]`; `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`; `temp` is not -1; `n` must be greater than 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain the absolute differences between each element of `a` starting from index `temp` and the corresponding element of `b` from the end, which is calculated as `b[-(n - i)]`. The loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`, so it will cover all elements from `a[temp]` to `a[n-1]` with their respective counterparts from the end of `b`.
