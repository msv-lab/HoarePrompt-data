The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and needs to be incremented by 1 for each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`**
