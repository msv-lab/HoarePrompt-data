Output State: `n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to the last index `i` where the condition was met or remains -1 if no such index was found, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `n` will still be greater than 0 (assuming it started as such), `temp` will hold the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was last true, or it will remain -1 if the condition was never met. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all indices from 0 to `n-1`.
