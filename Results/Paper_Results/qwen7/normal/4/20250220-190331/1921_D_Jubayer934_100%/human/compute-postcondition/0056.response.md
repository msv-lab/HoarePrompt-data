Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `i` is set to `temp` (which is `i`), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to `i` or `ans`.
