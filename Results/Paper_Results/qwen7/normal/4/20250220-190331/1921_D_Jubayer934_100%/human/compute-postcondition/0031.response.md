Output State: **`ans` now contains the value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `i` is `temp + 1`, `temp` is less than `n`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. Here, `i` is updated to `temp + 1` from the previous state, and `temp` remains less than `n`. The value of `ans` is updated with the new element, while the conditions on `i` and `temp` are preserved.
