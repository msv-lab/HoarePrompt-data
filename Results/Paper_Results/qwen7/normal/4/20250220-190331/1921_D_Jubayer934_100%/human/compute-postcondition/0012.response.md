Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
