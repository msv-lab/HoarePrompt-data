Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `i` is set to `temp` (which is `i`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.
