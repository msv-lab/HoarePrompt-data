Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop itself.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `temp` to `n` (exclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `i` must now be at least `temp` and less than `n - 1` (since `i + 1 < n`).

5. **Other States:**
   - The values of `ans`, `a`, `b`, `temp`, and `n` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n - 1`.
- `temp` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ans` remains the same.
- `a` and `b` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` now contains `abs(a[i + 1] - b[-(n - (i + 1))])` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n - 1`; `temp` is not -1; `n` must be greater than 0**
