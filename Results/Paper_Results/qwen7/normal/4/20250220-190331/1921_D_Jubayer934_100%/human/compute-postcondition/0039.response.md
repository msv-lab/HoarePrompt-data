Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `temp` is less than `n`, and the list `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index `temp` to `n-1` in ascending order, and the input value is now two integers `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on spaces, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `m`. The variables `i` and `temp`, and the list `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated input values `n` and `m`.
