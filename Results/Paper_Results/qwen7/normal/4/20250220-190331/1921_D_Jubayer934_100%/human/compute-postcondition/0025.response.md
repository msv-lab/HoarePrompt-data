Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, the value appended to `ans` is `abs(a[3] - b[3])`. No other changes occur to the variables, so `i` remains 3 and `n` remains greater than 1.
