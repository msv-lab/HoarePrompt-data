Output State: **`vis[next_node]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1, `q` contains the next node appended.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `vis[node]` to 1, meaning that the node has been visited. The initial state of `vis[next_node]` remains 1, and `q` still contains the next node appended as before.
