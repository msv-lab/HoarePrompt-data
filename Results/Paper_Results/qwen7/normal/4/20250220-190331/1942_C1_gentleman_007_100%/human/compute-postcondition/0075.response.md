Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while i != 0 and j != 0:`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `j`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is `len(b)`
   - `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters
   - `x` is the length of `a`
   - `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`
   - `y` remains 0
   - `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`
   - `l` is a list containing the character at index `-1` of `a` if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list

3. **Determine Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, both `i` and `j` must not be 0 simultaneously.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, `j` must be adjusted to a non-zero value for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is already 0, we need to change `j` to a non-zero value.
   - `j` is currently `len(b)`, so we need to reduce `j` to a value that is not zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `j` is not 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` must be a non-zero value, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing the character at index `-1` of `a` if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list**
