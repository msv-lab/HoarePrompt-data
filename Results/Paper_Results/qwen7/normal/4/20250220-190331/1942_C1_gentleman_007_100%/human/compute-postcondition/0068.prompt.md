You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, vis is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0, indicating whether each vertex has been visited.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: All nodes in the graph `graph` that are reachable from the initial vertex `ver` have their corresponding `vis[node]` set to 1. The deque `q` is empty since all nodes that could be processed have been visited. The variable `ver` holds the value of the last node that was processed in the loop. The graph `graph` remains unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, every node in the graph that can be reached from the initial vertex `ver` will have been visited, meaning `vis[node]` will be set to 1 for all such nodes. The deque `q` will be empty because all nodes have been processed. The variable `ver` will hold the value of the last node that was processed. The structure of the graph `graph` remains the same as it did before the loop started.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a vertex `ver`, a graph represented as a dictionary, and a visitation status list `vis`. It marks the given vertex as visited in the `vis` list and may traverse the graph to mark all reachable vertices as visited.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
