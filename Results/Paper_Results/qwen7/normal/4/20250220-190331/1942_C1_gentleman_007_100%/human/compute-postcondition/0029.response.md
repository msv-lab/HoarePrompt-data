Output State: **`q` is a list with one more element than before, `ver` is the first element of `q` before it was removed, and `graph[ver]` must have at least one element; `node` is added to `q`.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` adds the variable `node` to the list `q`. Since `q` had one less element before, now it has one more element. The variable `ver` remains unchanged and still represents the first element of `q` before `node` was appended. The condition that `graph[ver]` must have at least one element is still valid. The variable `node` is now part of the list `q`.
