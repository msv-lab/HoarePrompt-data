Output State: **`q` is a list with the same number of elements as before, `ver` is the first element of `q` before it was removed, `graph[ver]` must have at least one element, and `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `q` now contains an additional element which is `node`.**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
