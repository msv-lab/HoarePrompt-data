Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is a non-zero value - 1, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` remains an empty list.**

The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since `j` was a non-zero value initially, it is now one less than that non-zero value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
