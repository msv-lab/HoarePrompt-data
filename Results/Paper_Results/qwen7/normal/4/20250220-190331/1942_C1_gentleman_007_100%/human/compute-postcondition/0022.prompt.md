Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element, `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` remains unchanged except for `vis[ver]` which is set to 1.
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis[node]` is 1, and either q contains the node (if `vis[node]` was initially 1) or no change is made to q (if there is no else part).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `vis[next_node]` is 1, `vis[node]` is 1, and `q` contains the next node appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vis[node]` is 1, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` contains the next node appended. Since the condition `not vis[node]` is false, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
