Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `q` is a deque containing `ver`, `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list or array of the same length as the number of vertices, initialized to 0, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while len(q):
    ver = q.popleft()
    print(ver, end=' ')
    for node in graph[ver]:
        if not vis[node]:
            q.append(node)
            vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All nodes that are reachable from `ver` in the graph `graph` have `vis[node]` set to 1, and `q` contains all these nodes that were added during the loop executions. The variable `ver` retains its final value, which is the last node processed in the loop, and `graph` remains unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, every node that can be reached starting from `ver` through the graph's edges will have been visited, indicated by `vis[node]` being set to 1 for those nodes. The deque `q` will contain all such visited nodes. The specific node `ver` that was initially processed and any changes to it during the loop are not specified, so we assume it retains its final value from the last iteration. The graph structure itself does not change.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The final state of `q` will be an empty list, and `ver` will be the last unvisited element that was popped from `q`. All elements in `graph[ver]` that were not previously visited will have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All nodes in `graph[ver]` have been visited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
