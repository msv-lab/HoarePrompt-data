Output State: **`vis[next_node]` is 1, `q` contains the next node appended.**

Explanation: The code appends `node` to the list `q`. Since `vis[next_node]` was initially 1, the condition for appending to `q` is met, and `node` is added to `q`. The state of `vis[next_node]` remains unchanged as it was already 1.
