Output State: **`i` is -1, `j` is `len(b)`, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `len(b) + 1` to `len(b)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
