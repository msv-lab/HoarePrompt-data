Output State: **`vis[node]` is true, q contains the node**.

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. Since `vis[node]` was initially false, it remains unchanged in terms of its boolean value but is marked as having been visited. The list `q` now contains the `node`.
