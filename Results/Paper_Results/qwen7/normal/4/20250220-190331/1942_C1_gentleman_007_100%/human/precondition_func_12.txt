n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. The input is structured such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0. The input also includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices.
