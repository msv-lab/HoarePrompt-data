Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node (initially stored in `ver`) and have not been visited yet will have their corresponding `vis` flags set to 1, and they will be added to the queue `q`. The variable `ver` will continue to be updated with new nodes as they are dequeued from `q` and processed, ensuring that all connected, unvisited nodes are eventually visited and added to `q`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, all nodes that can be reached from the starting node through a series of edges will have their `vis` flag set to 1, indicating they have been visited, and they will all be in the queue `q`.
