Output State: **`q` is a list with the same number of elements as before, `ver` is the first element of `q` before it was removed, `graph[ver]` must have at least one element, and `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`; `q` now contains an additional element which is `node`, `vis[node]` is set to 1.**

This means that the variable `vis[node]` has been assigned the value 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
