The function `func_7` takes a list `l` of integers as input, where each integer represents a vertex chosen by Bessie. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a unique integer from the list `l`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `l`. The original list `l` and the variable `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
