Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` is a deque containing the remaining elements after removing the first element.
- `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`.
- `graph` remains unchanged.
- `vis` remains unchanged except for `vis[ver]` which is set to 1.

The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ver`, which is the first element that was removed from `q`.

Output: **ver**
