Output State: All nodes in the graph `graph` that are reachable from the initial vertex `ver` have their corresponding `vis[node]` set to 1. The deque `q` is empty since all nodes that could be processed have been visited. The variable `ver` holds the value of the last node that was processed in the loop. The graph `graph` remains unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, every node in the graph that can be reached from the initial vertex `ver` will have been visited, meaning `vis[node]` will be set to 1 for all such nodes. The deque `q` will be empty because all nodes have been processed. The variable `ver` will hold the value of the last node that was processed. The structure of the graph `graph` remains the same as it did before the loop started.
