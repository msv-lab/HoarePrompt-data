Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer obtained from input, `m` is an integer obtained from input, `k` is an integer obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged.
