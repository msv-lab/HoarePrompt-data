You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, m, and k such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, itest equals the total number of iterations specified by t, n, m, and k are integers obtained from the input split for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO'.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it also prints 'NO'.
     3. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint all parts. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

4. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
   - This condition checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that at least one color appears at least `ceil(n / m)` times.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'NO'. 
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly.
   - For other cases, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. 

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
