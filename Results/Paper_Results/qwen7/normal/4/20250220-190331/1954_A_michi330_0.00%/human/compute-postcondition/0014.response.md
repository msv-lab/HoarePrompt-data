Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `n` and `m` are integers, `k` is an integer. The condition of the if statement does not change the values of these variables, so the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
