Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `itest` is 2, `n` is an integer obtained from input, `m` is an integer obtained from input, `k` is an integer obtained from input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made as well.
