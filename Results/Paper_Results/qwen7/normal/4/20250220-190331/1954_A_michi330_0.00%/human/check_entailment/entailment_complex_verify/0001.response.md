### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO'.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it also prints 'NO'.
     3. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - This condition checks if Bob can repaint all parts. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

4. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
   - This condition checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that at least one color appears at least `ceil(n / m)` times.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the program should print 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly.
   - For other cases, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct according to the problem statement.

However, there is a logical flaw in the second condition check. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` does not accurately determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Instead, it checks if Bob can still make all parts the same color after repainting.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
- If `n > k`, we need to check if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. This can be done by ensuring that no single color appears more than `k` times.

The correct approach is to check if `m * k < n`. If this condition is true, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color appears more than `k` times, making it impossible for Bob to repaint all parts to the same color.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or m * k >= n:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original assessment incorrectly used the condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- The corrected condition `m * k < n` accurately determines if Alice can achieve her goal.

Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final: **False**
