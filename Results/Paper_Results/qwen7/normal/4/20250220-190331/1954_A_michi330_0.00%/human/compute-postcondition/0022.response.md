Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes three positive integers n, m, and k such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, where t represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it checks the relationship between n, m, and k and returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

However, since the exact return values based on the conditions are not specified in the given output, the functionality description focuses on the parameters and the general process.
