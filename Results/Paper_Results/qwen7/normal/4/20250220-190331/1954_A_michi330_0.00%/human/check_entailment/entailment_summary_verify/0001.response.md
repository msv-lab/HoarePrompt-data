### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed analysis of the program and concluded that it correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to confirm the accuracy of this conclusion.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `n <= k`, it prints 'NO'.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it prints 'NO'.
     3. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Condition 1: `n <= k`**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

4. **Condition 2: `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**
   - This condition checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of different colors needed to ensure that at least one color appears at least `ceil(n / m)` times.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`, it means Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the program correctly prints 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly.
   - For other cases, the program prints 'Yes', which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description, function summary, and the original assessment.
