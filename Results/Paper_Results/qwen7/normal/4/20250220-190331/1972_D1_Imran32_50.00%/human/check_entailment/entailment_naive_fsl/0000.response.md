Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program attempts to solve a different problem related to counting pairs based on a square root calculation, which does not match the actual problem statement.

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided solution does not address this condition at all. Instead, it calculates a value based on the square root of \(n\) and adds some counts without considering the gcd condition or the specific relationship between \(a\) and \(b\).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 2
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  4
  ```

- Explanation:
  The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). For each pair, \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\):
  - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), which is true.
  - \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), which is false.
  - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\), which is false.
  - \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\), which is true.

However, the program will not correctly identify these pairs and will likely produce an incorrect result.

Since the program does not handle the required conditions and produces incorrect results for the given problem, the correctness is **False**.
