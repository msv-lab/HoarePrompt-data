### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description and the annotated code step-by-step to determine the correctness of the provided program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function takes two integers \(n\) and \(k\) as input.
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

2. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1()` does not use the variable `k` at all, which suggests that `k` might be a typo or unused.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - This logic does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case: `2 2`.
   - The expected output is 4 because the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
   - However, the program will only consider the pairs where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\), which is true.
   - For \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\), which is false.
   - For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\), which is false.
   - For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\), which is true.
   - Therefore, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\), resulting in an output of 2, which is incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required conditions and will produce incorrect results for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the required conditions and produces incorrect results for the given problem.
