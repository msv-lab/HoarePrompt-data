Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n` plus `(n + i) // cnt`, `root` must be at least 2, `cnt` is `i * i`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `root`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
