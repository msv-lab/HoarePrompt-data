Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n` plus \((n + i) // cnt\), `root` is at least 2, `cnt` is `i * i`, and `i` is `root`, `cnt` is updated to `i * i`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cnt` to `i * i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `cnt` is now explicitly defined as `i * i`, where `i` is equal to `root`.
