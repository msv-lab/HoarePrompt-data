Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` must be at least 2, `cnt` is `i * i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i * i` to the variable `cnt`. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, `cnt` is updated to the square of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `root`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
