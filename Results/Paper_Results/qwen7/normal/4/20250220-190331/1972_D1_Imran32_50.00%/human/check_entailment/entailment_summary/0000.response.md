Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a formula that does not match the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\right)\), which is not related to the conditions that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To verify this, let's compare the program's logic with the required conditions:

1. The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is the number of valid pairs when \(b = 1\).
2. It then iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n} + 1\), adding terms \(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\) to `ans`. This part of the logic does not account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the execution summary and the example inputs, the program does not produce the correct output for any of the test cases. For instance, the correct answers for the given examples should be:

- For \(1 \leq a \leq 1\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 1\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), so the answer is 1.
- For \(1 \leq a \leq 2\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), so the answer is 3.
- For \(1 \leq a \leq 3\) and \(1 \leq b \leq 5\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((3, 1)\), so the answer is 4.
- And so on...

The program's logic does not align with these requirements, and thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
