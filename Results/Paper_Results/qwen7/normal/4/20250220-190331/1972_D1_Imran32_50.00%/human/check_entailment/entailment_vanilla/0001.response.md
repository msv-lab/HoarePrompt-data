Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. The function should be called with `n` and `m` as arguments.
   - The variable `k` is used in the function definition but is not defined in the main loop where the function is called.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically, it does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop and calculations inside the function do not relate to the problem constraints.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
