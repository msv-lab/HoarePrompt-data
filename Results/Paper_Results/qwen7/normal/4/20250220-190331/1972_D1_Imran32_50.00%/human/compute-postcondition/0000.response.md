Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, k is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
