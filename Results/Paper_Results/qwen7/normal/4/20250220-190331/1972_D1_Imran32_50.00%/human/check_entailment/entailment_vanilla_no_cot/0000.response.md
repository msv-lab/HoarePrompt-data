Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not follow the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The problem requires checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided code does not include this check and instead seems to be implementing a different logic related to the square root of `n`.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n` and `m`.
3. Iterate through all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and `b` from 1 to `m`.
4. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
5. Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.
6. Print the count for each test case.

The current implementation does not perform these steps and thus will not provide the correct output for the given problem.
