Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`, `root` is at least 2, and `i` is `root + 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to \(10^4\), `n` and `k` remain as they were initially, and `ans` is updated to include the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each `i` starting from 2 up to `root + 1`. The value of `root` is at least 2, and the last value of `i` used in the loop is `root + 1`.
