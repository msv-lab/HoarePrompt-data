Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 0 (if `c` equals `a` or `b`) or the total number of iterations the loop executed (if `c` does not equal `a` or `b`), `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is a string (neither `a` nor `b`), `no` is False, and `x` is the last character in `c` (if the loop breaks due to a character not being in `a` or `b`).**
