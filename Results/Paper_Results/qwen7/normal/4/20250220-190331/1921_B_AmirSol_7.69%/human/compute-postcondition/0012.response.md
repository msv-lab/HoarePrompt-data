Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, and the following conditions hold: if `i` is less than `n - 1`, then the next element in `s1` is not equal to the next element in `s2` and the current element in `s1` is not equal to the next element in `s1`.
