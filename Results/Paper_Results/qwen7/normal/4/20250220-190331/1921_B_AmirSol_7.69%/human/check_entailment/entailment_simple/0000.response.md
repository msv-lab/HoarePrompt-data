### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`). Each operation can either add a cat, remove a cat, or move a cat from one box to another.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to count the number of positions where the initial state (`s1`) differs from the desired state (`s2`).
   - If `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` differ, it counts this as an operation.
   - The function iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` and increments the counter whenever a mismatch is found.
   - The function does not account for the types of operations (add, remove, move), but simply counts the number of mismatches.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly identifies the number of positions where the states differ.
   - However, the problem statement specifies that the scientists can perform three types of operations (add, remove, move). The function does not differentiate between these operations; it just counts the number of mismatches.
   - The function does not consider the efficiency of operations (e.g., moving a cat might be more efficient than adding or removing a cat).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example given:
     - Test Case 1: `n = 5`, `s1 = "10010"`, `s2 = "00001"`
       - Mismatches: (1st, 4th, 5th positions)
       - Output: `2` (Correct, as two moves are needed: move cat from 1st to 5th, remove cat from 4th)
     - Test Case 2: `n = 1`, `s1 = "1"`, `s2 = "1"`
       - No mismatches
       - Output: `0` (Correct)
     - Test Case 3: `n = 3`, `s1 = "000"`, `s2 = "111"`
       - Mismatches: (all positions)
       - Output: `3` (Correct, as three adds are needed)

5. **Conclusion**:
   - While the function correctly counts the number of mismatches, it does not account for the different types of operations and their efficiencies.
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations, which includes considering the types of operations.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly solve the problem as stated because it does not consider the different types of operations and their efficiencies.
