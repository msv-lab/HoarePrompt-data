Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, and the current value of `i` is less than `n - 1` and the next element in `s1` is not equal to the next element in `s2` and the current element in `s1` is not equal to the next element in `s1`.**

Explanation: The `counter` variable was incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
