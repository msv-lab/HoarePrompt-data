Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was either 1 or 2 initially, after executing the code, `i` will now be either 2 or 3. All other variables (`counter`, `n`, `s1[i]`, and `s2[i]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
