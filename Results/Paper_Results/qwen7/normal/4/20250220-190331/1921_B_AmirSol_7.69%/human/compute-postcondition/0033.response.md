Output State: **`counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is either 2, 3, or 4, after incrementing, `i` will now be either 3 or 4 (it cannot be 2 because it was incremented from 2). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
