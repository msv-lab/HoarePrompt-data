Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, and either `i` is not less than `n - 1` or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]` or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged as per the initial state.
