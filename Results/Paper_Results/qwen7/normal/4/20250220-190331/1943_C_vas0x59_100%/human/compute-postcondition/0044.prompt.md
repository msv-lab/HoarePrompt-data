Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will execute `n-1` times, after all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` will be the first integer input decreased by `n-1`, `v` will be the second integer input decreased by `n-1`, and both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain each other as elements. The variables `d` and `previous` are the results of the bfs function call `bfs(a)`, and `a` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will execute \( n-1 \) times, after all iterations, \( n \) must be greater than 1, \( u \) will be the first integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), \( v \) will be the second integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), and both \( u2vs[u] \) and \( u2vs[v] \) will contain each other as elements. The variables \( d \) and \( previous \) are the results of the `bfs` function call `bfs(a)`, and \( a \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`; \( b \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of \( b \); if \( n \) is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; \( path_ba \) now contains the value of \( n \).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The loop will execute \( n-1 \) times, after all iterations, \( n \) must be greater than 1, \( u \) will be the first integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), \( v \) will be the second integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), and both \( u2vs[u] \) and \( u2vs[v] \) will contain each other as elements. The variables \( d \) and \( previous \) are the results of the `bfs` function call `bfs(a)`, and \( a \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`; \( b \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of \( b \); \( n \) is updated to be `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. If \( n \) equals -1, we break out of the loop; `path_ba` now contains an additional element which is the new value of \( n \).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `path_ba` is updated to include `n`, and `n` is equal to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
