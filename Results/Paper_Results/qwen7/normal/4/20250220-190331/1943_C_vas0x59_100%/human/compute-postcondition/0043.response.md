Output State: **`path_ba` is updated to include `n`, and `n` is equal to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. According to the initial state, `n` is equal to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. After appending `n` to `path_ba`, the last element of `path_ba` (i.e., `path_ba[-1]`) is now `n`. The condition `if n == -1` is not met here since the value of `n` is derived from `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, which means `n` is not -1 initially. Therefore, no loop or if statement is broken out of.
