Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a common convention when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop runs for `n - 1` iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\).
   - `u2vs` is a list of length `n`, and each element is an empty list.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `n - 1` times, meaning the loop will execute if `n - 1` is a positive integer (i.e., \(n > 1\)).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop runs `n - 1` times, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, so no adjustments are needed for `_`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `n`, which must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
