Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `u` is the first integer input decreased by `n-1`, `v` is the second integer input decreased by `n-1`, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` contain each other as elements, `d` and `previous` are the results of `bfs(a)`, `a` and `b` are the results of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` contains a sequence of values representing the path from `b` back to `a`, `n` is the number of steps taken to reach from `b` to `a` in the graph, `ops` is an empty list, `c1` is the value of `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is the value of `path_ba[ci2]`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing tuples `((c1, 1), (c2, 2))

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 4, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 4, `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 4)` and `(c2, 4)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 6, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 6, `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 6)`, `(c2, 4)`, `(c2, 6)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
