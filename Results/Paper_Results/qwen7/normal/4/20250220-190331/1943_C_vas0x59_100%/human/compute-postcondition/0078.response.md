Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10³) and a list `u2vs` representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. It constructs the tree based on the given edges. Then, it performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find the shortest path between two specific nodes. Based on the length of this path, it generates a list of operations and prints the count of these operations followed by the detailed operations themselves. Finally, the function returns None.**
