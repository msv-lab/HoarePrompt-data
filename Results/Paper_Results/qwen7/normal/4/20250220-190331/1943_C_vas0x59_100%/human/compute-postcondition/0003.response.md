Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input, `v` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers `u` and `v`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still greater than 1, while `u` and `v` are now specific integers derived from the input.
