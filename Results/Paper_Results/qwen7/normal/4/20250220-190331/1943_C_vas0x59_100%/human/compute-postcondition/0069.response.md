Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 6, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than 6, `ops` now contains the tuples `(c1, 6)`, `(c2, 4)`**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 6, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c1, 6)`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
