Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 1, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing the value of `u`.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input, splits them, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively. Both `u` and `v` are then decreased by 1. The initial conditions for `n`, `u2vs[v]` remain unchanged except that `u2vs[v]` is updated to contain the value of `u`.
