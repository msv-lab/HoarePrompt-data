Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 2, `u2vs[u].append(v)`, `u2vs[v].append(u)`**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Before this line of code, `u2vs[u].append(v)` had already appended the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Now, `u` is added to the list `u2vs[v]`. The conditions and values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from the initial state.
