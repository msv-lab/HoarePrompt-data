Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

The code initializes a string `s` with the alphabet. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
