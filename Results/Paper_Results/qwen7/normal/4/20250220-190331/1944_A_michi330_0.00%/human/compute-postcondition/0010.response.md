Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` is converted to an integer from input, `k` is converted to an integer from input.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still at least 1, `i` is still `t + 1`, and `n` and `k` are now integers from the input.
