Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `t` is at least 1, meaning `t` could be any integer greater than or equal to 1.
2. `i` is defined as `t + 1`, so `i` will be one more than whatever value `t` has.
3. `n` is described as the first integer input, and `k` is described as the second integer input. These values are not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
