Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k within specified ranges (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2) as part of its input through a test case structure where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 test cases are considered. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts two integers `n` and `k` through a series of test cases, where `t` defines the number of such test cases. For each test case, `n` is between 1 and 100, and `k` is between 0 and (n * (n - 1)) / 2. The function then determines and returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.
