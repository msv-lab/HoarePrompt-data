You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` will be 0, as the loop runs from `range(t)`, and after all iterations, `t` will reach 0 since each iteration decreases `t` by 1. For each remaining value of `t`, the same process of taking three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, checking if their sum is even, and then calculating `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b` will occur. If the sum is odd, `-1` will be printed and the loop will continue with the next value of `t`. After all iterations, if there are no more values of `t`, the loop ends, and `t` is set to 0. Variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` will retain their last computed values based on the last set of inputs provided before `t` became 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the final values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` will be those from the last set of inputs processed before `t` reached 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is even, it calculates two values: \(x\) as half of the sum and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\). If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\). After processing all test cases, the function sets the counter \(t\) to 0. The final output consists of the results for each valid test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 1 point to each player in a draw).
   
3. **Calculating Maximum Possible Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents half of the total points, which can be distributed among the games.
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Draws:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of draws is simply the minimum of `x` and `y`. However, this does not necessarily give the maximum number of draws.
   - The correct approach should consider the distribution of points more carefully. Specifically, the maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the points are distributed such that the number of draws is maximized while still satisfying the constraints.

2. **Handling Cases with No Draws:**
   - The program does not handle cases where no draws are possible correctly. For example, if `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 2`, the program will output `1` (which is incorrect since no draws are possible).

### Example Analysis:

- **Case: `0 0 0`**
  - Sum is `0`, which is even.
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
  - Output: `0` (correct).

- **Case: `0 1 1`**
  - Sum is `2`, which is even.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (correct).

- **Case: `1 1 1`**
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1` (correct).

- **Case: `1 1 2`**
  - Sum is `4`, which is even.
  - `x = 2`, `y = 2`.
  - Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `1`).

- **Case: `3 3 3`**
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1` (correct).

- **Case: `3 4 5`**
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`.
  - Output: `6` (incorrect, should be `4`).

- **Case: `1 1 10`**
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`.
  - Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `4`).

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
