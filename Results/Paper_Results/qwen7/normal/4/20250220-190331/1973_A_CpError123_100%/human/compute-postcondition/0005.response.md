Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **-1**
