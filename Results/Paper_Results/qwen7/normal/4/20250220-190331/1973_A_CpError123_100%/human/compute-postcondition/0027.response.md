Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is the integer value of (`a` + `b` + `c`) divided by 2, `y` is `a` + `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a + b` to `y`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `y` is updated to be the sum of `a` and `b`, while `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` retain their original values.
