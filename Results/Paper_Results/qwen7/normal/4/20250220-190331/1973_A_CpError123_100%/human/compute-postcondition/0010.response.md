Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2, `y` is `a + b`.**

In this case, the code `y = a + b` simply assigns the sum of `a` and `b` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
