You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` will be 0, as the loop runs from `range(t)`, and after all iterations, `t` will reach 0 since each iteration decreases `t` by 1. For each remaining value of `t`, the same process of taking three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, checking if their sum is even, and then calculating `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b` will occur. If the sum is odd, `-1` will be printed and the loop will continue with the next value of `t`. After all iterations, if there are no more values of `t`, the loop ends, and `t` is set to 0. Variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` will retain their last computed values based on the last set of inputs provided before `t` became 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the final values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` will be those from the last set of inputs processed before `t` reached 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined constraints for t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, it processes these values; otherwise, it returns an appropriate value or error message.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
