Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `x` is the integer division of `(a + b + c)` by 2.
- `y` is `a + b`.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the values entered by the user.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints `-1`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, or `y`, and it directly prints the integer `-1`, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
