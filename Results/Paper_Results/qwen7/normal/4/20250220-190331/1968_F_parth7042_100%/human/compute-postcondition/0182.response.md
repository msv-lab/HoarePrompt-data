Output State: **`i` is 4, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `index` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. Given `i` is 4, `pf[4]` is calculated as `pf[3] ^ a[4]`. The value of `i` itself does not change, and `index` is increased by 1 as per the initial state.
