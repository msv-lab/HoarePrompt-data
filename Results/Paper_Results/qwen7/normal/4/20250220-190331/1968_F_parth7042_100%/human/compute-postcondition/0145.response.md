Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given that `index` was initially `index + 5`, after the increment, `index` becomes `index + 7`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged as they are based on the updated `index` value. Therefore, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])` (which was `int(data[index + 2])` before) and `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])` (which was `int(data[index + 6])` before). The condition that `q` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
