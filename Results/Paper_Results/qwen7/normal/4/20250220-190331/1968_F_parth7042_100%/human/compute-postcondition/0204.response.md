Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in the sorted list `v1` using binary search; `it2` is the index of `r` in the list `v2` using `bisect_left` minus 1; if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` hold, then `results` list contains 'YES'; otherwise, `results` list contains 'NO'.
