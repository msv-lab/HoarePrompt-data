Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], `v1` is mp[pf[r]], `v2` is mp[pf[l - 1]], `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l), `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'YES' and we continue to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` assigns the result of the `bisect_left` function, which finds the leftmost index where `l` can be inserted to maintain sorted order in `v1`, to the variable `it1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
