Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; the current value of `x` is 0; `results` is a list containing 'YES'.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
