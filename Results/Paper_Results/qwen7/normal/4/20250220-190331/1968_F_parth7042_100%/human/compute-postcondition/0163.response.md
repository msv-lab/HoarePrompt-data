Output State: **`q` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 6`, and `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `q`. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 6`, and `n` remains an integer value from `data[index]`, which was the case before the code execution.
