Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `pf[i]` is set to `pf[1] ^ a[2]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 2 (and it will become 3).
- We need to ensure that `i < n + 1` for the loop to continue.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we can only adjust `i` and ensure that the condition `i < n + 1` holds true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
