Output State: **`results` list will have `q + 1` elements, `data` list remains unchanged, `index` is updated to `index + 4`, `l` and `r` are set based on the current values of `data` at the positions determined by `index`, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is decremented by 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**

This means that the list `a` has been created with `n + 1` elements, all initialized to 0, while the other variables remain as they were before the execution of the code.
