Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the same as before (`mp[pf[r]]`), `v2` is the same as before (`mp[pf[l - 1]]`), `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), `q` is `q - 1`, `results` is `['YES']`.**

The code appends 'YES' to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `data`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `q` remain unchanged from their previous states.
