Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head in this case is simply `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable, often used when the loop variable itself is not needed), but we need to consider the variables that might change within the loop and affect its continuation.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Continuation:**
   The loop condition is controlled by the variable `q`. For the loop to continue, `q` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `q` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`.
   - `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`.
   - `index` is increased by 2.
   - `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`.
   - `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.
   - `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1.
   - The `results` list is updated based on the conditions involving `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, and `v2`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `index` is increased by 2 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `index` should be `index + 2`.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `q` stays the same.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `q` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `index` is now `index + 2`.
   - All other variables (`l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, and `results`) remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration because they are not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `index` is `index + 2`; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, the `results` list contains 'YES'; otherwise, the `results` list contains 'NO'.**
