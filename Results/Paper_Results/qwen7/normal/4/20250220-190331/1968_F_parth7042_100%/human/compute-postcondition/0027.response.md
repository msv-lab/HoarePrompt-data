Output State: **`a[1]` is updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`, `index` is now `index_current + 3`, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] XOR a[1]`, `mp[pf[1]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1` and now also contains `i_current + 1`, `pf[i]` is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `i_current + 1` to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `i` was not specified in the code, it is assumed to be the last index used, which is `1` in this case. Therefore, `mp[pf[1]]` now contains `i_current + 1` twice. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
