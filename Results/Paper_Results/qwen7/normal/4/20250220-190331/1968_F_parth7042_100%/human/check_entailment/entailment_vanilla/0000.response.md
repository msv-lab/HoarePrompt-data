### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the input to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `q` are the size of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
   - Arrays `a` and `pf` are initialized with zeros. `a` stores the original array, and `pf` stores the prefix XOR values.
   - `mp` is a dictionary that maps prefix XOR values to their indices.

3. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in `pf`.
   - It also populates the dictionary `mp` with the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program extracts the start (`l`) and end (`r`) indices.
   - It calculates the XOR value for the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the formula `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If this XOR value is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a split point within the subarray such that the XOR of the left and right parts is equal to the calculated XOR value.
   - This is done by using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find suitable indices in `mp`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results for each query and prints them.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating prefix XOR and checking for the interesting condition is correct.
- The use of `bisect_left` to find suitable indices is appropriate for determining if a split is possible.
- The overall structure and flow of the program match the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
