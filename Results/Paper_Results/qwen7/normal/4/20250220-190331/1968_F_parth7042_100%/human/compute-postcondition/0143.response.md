Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 5`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 1])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to `int(data[index])`. Since `index` was previously `index + 4`, it is now updated to `index + 5`. The value of `l` is set to `int(data[index - 1])` because `index` is now `index + 5`, making `index - 1` equal to the original `index + 4 - 1 = index + 3`. However, since `l` was originally set to `int(data[index - 2])`, and now `index` is `index + 5`, `l` is updated to `int(data[index - 1])`. The value of `r` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that `q` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid.
