Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is ['YES']**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially empty, after appending `'YES'`, it now contains one element, which is `'YES'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
