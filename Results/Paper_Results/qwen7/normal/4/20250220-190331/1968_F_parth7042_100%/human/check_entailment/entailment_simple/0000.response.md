### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings (`data`).
   - It then iterates through the test cases, processing each one separately.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it initializes arrays `a` and `pf` (prefix XOR array).
   - It populates `a` with the integers from the input and calculates the prefix XOR values in `pf`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that value occurs.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it extracts the start and end indices (`l` and `r`).
   - It calculates the XOR value of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If this XOR value is zero, the subarray is considered interesting.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a valid split point within the subarray that makes it interesting.

5. **Split Point Check:**
   - It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find potential split points and checks if they satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

6. **Result Collection:**
   - The results for each query are collected in the `results` list.

7. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description. There are no apparent logical errors or issues in the code.
