Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `index` is increased by 1**.

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid. The variable `index` is incremented by 1, but its specific new value is not provided, so we only state that it has been increased by 1.
