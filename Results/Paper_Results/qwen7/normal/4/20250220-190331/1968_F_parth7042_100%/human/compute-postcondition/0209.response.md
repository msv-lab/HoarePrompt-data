Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
