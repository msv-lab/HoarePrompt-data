Output State: **`q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 2`, `l` is now `int(data[index])`, all other variables (`r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, and `results`) remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `q` stays the same (greater than or equal to 1), `index` increases by 2, and `l` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables retain their values from the previous iteration.
