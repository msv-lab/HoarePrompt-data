Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. The current value of `x` is 0; `results` now contains 'YES'.**

The code `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
