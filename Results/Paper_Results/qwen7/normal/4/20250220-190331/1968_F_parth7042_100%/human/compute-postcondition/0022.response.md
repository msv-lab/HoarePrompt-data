Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `int(data[index_current + 2])`, `index` is now `index_current + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] XOR a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing `i_current + 1`, and `mp[pf[i]]` appends `i_current + 1` to itself.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is `i_current + 1`) to the list stored in `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `i` was previously set to `i_current + 1`, the list `mp[pf[i]]` now contains two elements: `i_current + 1` and `i_current + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
