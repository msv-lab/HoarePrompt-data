The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of variables outside the loop. Given the initial state and the code snippet, the values of `q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 7`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 3])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is now `['YES']`.**
