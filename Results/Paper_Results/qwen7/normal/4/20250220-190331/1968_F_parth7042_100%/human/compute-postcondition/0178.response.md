Output State: **`i` is 3; `index` is increased by 1; `a[3]` is equal to `data[index]` as an integer; `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`; `mp[pf[3]]` contains the list `[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list stored at the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Given the initial conditions, `pf[3]` is calculated as `pf[2] ^ a[3]`, and since `a[3]` is `data[index]` as an integer and `index` is increased by 1, `mp[pf[3]]` now contains the list `[3]`.
