Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is now the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is updated to the value of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is updated to the value of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` now contains 'YES', and `q` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `it2` to the value of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Since `v2` was previously assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is now updated to the value of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
