Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the same as before (`mp[pf[r]]`), `v2` is the same as before (`mp[pf[l - 1]]`), `it1` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v1, l)`), `it2` is the same as before (`bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`), `q` is `q - 1`, and `v1` is updated to `mp[pf[r]]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `v1` to `mp[pf[r]]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their previous states.
