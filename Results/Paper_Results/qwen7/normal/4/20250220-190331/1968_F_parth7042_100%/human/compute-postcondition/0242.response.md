Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, q, and a list of n integers a. It then handles q queries, each defined by integers l and r. For each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the given range [l, r] whose bitwise XOR is zero. If such a subarray exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints the results list, where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', corresponding to each query.**
