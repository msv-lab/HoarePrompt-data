Output State: **`q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 4`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is a list containing 'YES', all other variables (`r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously unchanged, it now contains the element `'YES'`. All other variables (`q`, `index`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain in their respective unchanged states as per the initial conditions.
