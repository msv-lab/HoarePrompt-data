Output State: **`q` remains greater than or equal to 1, `index` is now `index + 4`, `l` is now `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is a list containing 'YES', 'NO', `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` (or the position where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted), `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contained only `'YES'`. After appending `'NO'`, `results` now contains both `'YES'` and `'NO'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
