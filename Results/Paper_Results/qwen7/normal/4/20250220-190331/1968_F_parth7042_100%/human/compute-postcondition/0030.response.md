Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code `l = int(data[index])` takes the value at the index `index` from the list `data`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `l`. The initial values of `data` and `index` remain unchanged.
