Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 5, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is int(data[index + 1]), `x` is pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1], `v1` is not yet defined, `v2` is not yet defined, `it1` is not yet defined, `it2` is not yet defined, `q` is `q - 1`, `results` contains 'YES' and we continue to the next iteration.**
