Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]**.

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. This means that `index` now holds a value that is 2 more than its original value. The values of `data`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The new value of `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` (since `index` was incremented by 2), and the new value of `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
