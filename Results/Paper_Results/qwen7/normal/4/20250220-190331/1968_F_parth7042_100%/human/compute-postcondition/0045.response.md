Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l), `it2` is the result of bisect_left(v2, r) - 1, `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1` or `it2` is less than 0 or the value at `v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to the value at `v2[it2]`**
