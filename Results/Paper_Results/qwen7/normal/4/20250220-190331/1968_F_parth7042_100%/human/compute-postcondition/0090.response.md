Output State: **`i` is 1; `index` is increased by 1.**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The variable `index` is incremented by 1, but its exact new value depends on its original value before the increment. Since the original value of `index` is not specified, we only know that it has been increased by 1.
