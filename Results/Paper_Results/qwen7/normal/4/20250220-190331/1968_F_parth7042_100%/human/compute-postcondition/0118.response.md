Postcondition: `q` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1, `it1` is an index in `v1` such that `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` and `it2` is non-negative.
