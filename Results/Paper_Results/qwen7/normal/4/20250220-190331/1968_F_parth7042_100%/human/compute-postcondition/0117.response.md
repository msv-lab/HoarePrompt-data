Output State: **`q` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using binary search (bisect_left) - 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `it2` as the index of the first occurrence of `r` in `v2` using `bisect_left` and then subtracts 1. This does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, `x`, `v1`, or `v2`. The value of `it2` is derived from the binary search operation on `v2` for the value `r`, and then adjusted by subtracting 1.
