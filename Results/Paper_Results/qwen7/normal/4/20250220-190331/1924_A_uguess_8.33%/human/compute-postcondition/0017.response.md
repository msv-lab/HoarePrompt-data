Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is incremented by 1 and then shifted left by `cur_ss` bits.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by 1 and then shifts the result to the left by `cur_ss` bits. The value of `cur_ss` remains unchanged, and `s` is also unchanged.
