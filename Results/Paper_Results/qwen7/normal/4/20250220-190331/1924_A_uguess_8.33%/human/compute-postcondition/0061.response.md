Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s` remains the same, `cur` remains the same, `cnt` remains the same, `cur_ss` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. However, the initial values of `i`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
