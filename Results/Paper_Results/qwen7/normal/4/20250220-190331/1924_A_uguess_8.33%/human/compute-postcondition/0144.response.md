Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for ss in s`. This means the loop variable is `ss`, which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ss` is the second character of the string `s`.
   - `cnt` is 2.
   - `cur` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ss` is the second character of the string `s`, the next character in the string (the third character) will be assigned to `ss` in the next iteration.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cur` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ss` will be the third character of the string `s`.
   - `cnt` remains 2.
   - `cur` remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`ss` is the third character of the string `s`, `cnt` is 2, and `cur` is 0**.
