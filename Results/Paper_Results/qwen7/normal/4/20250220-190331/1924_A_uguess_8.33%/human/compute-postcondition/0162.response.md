Postcondition: **`tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, `i` is 0, and the current value of `cur` satisfies `cur & 1 << i == 0`**
