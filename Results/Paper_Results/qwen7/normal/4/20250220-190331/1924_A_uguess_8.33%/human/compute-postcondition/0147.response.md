Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of the string `s`, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 1 shifted left by the ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a' if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0. If the bit is 1, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `ss` is the third character of the string `s`, `cnt` is 2, and `cur` is 1 shifted left by the ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a'.
