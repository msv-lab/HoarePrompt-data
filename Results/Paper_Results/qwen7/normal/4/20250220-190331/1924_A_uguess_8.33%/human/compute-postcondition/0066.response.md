Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` to the variable `cur_ss`. Here, `ss` is a character from the string `s`. The values of `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged, and `s` remains a non-empty string. The exact value of `cur_ss` depends on the character `ss`, but it is calculated as the Unicode value of `ss` minus the Unicode value of `'a'`.
