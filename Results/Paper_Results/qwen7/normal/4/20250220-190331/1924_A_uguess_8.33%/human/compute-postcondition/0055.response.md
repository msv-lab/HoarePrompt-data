Output State: `s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (from `i` = 0 to `i` = `k-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `k-1`. Since `tmp` is assigned the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)`, and `i` goes from 0 to `k-1`, the final value of `tmp` will be `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, which is 'c' if `k` is 3. The value of `ans` will be the string 'c' repeated `cnt` times because `tmp` is used to build `ans` within the loop, and since `cur & 1 << i == 0` always holds true for all `i` from 0 to `k-1` in this case, `tmp` will always be 'c'. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
