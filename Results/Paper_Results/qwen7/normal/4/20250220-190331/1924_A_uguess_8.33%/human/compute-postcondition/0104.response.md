Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a', `ans` is 'z', `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cur` & 1 << `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ord('a') + i` equals 97 (which is the ASCII value of `'a'`), and `chr(97)` is `'a'`. Thus, `tmp` is updated to `'a'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
