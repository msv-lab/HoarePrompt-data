Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `s` is an empty string.
- Since `s` is empty, `cur` is 0.
- `cnt` is equal to the number of characters in the original string `s`, which is 0.
- `cur_ss` is undefined because `s` is empty.
- The print statement simply outputs the string "YES" without referencing any of the other variables or their values.
