Output State: **`tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. `cnt`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `cur_ss` retain their initial or final states as given.**

Explanation: The code assigns a string of length `cnt` (where `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, with each character's bit in the substring matching the corresponding bit in `cur`) to the variable `ans`. Each character in this string is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. The other variables (`tmp`, `cur`, `i`, `t`, `ans`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`) retain their initial or final states as given.
