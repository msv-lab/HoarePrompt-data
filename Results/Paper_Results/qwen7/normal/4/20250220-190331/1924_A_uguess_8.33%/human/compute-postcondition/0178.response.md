Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `tmp` is set to 'e'.
- `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`. Since `s` is not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt`.
- `cur` is initialized to 0.
- `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Here, `n` is not explicitly provided, but it is the length of the string `ans`.

Given these details, let's construct the value of `ans`:

1. Each character in `ans` is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, which translates to the character at position `k - 1` in the alphabet (since `ord('a')` is 97).
2. This character is followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

So, if we denote the character at position `k - 1` in the alphabet as `c`, then each character in `ans` would be `c` followed by `n - cnt - 1` 'a's.

Since `n` and `cnt` are not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output: **a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times**
