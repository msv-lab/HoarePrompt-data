Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'c', `ans` is 'z', `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp`. Since `i` is 2, `ord('a')` gives the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Adding `i` (which is 2) to this gives 99, and `chr(99)` returns the character corresponding to the ASCII value 99, which is 'c'. All other variables remain unchanged.
