Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), input from user, all other variables are not defined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: If the number of characters in the string `s` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `s` remains an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the number of characters in the original string `s`, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the last character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a' if `s` is not empty; otherwise, it is undefined. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) times, and `tmp` is 'c'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'zdaa', `i` is 2, and `k` is at least 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop has executed for all iterations, `cnt` will be the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` will be reset to 0, and `cnt` will contain the final count. If `cnt` is less than `n`, then `tmp` will be 'e', `cnt` will be the total count of valid substrings, `cur` will be 0, `ans` will be a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, and `k` will retain its initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
