Postcondition: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the number of characters in the original string `s`, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the last character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a' if `s` is not empty; otherwise, it is undefined, and the number of characters in `s` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
