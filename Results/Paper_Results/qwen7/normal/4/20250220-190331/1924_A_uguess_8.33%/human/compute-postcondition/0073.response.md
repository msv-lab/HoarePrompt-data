Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, where `k` is the value of `cur_ss` plus one. The first bit set in `cur` is the `k`-th bit from the right.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `cur` and its relationship to `k` remain unchanged.
