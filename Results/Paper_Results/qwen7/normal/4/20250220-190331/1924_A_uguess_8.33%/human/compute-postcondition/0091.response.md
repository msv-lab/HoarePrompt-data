Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `cur` is either 0 or `1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `cur` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, `cur` is still either 0 or `1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`, and `cur_ss` is still `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
