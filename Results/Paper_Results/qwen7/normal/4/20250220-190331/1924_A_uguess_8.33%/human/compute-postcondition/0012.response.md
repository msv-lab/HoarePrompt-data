Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a', `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cnt` is equal to `cnt + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `s` remains a string with at least one character, `cur_ss` retains its initial value, `cur` remains equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`.
