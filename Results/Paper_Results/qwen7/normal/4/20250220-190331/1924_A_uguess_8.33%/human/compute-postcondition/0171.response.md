Output State: **`tmp` is 'e', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `tmp` to 'e' by calculating `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is 4. The calculation `ord('a') + 4` results in the ASCII value of 'e'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
