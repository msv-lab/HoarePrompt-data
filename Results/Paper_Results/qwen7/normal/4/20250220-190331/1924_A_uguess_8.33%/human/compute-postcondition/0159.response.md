Output State: **`tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` is reset to 0, and `cnt` holds the final count. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`) retain their initial or final states as given.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `tmp`. This does not affect the values of `cnt`, `cur`, or any other variables mentioned. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `cnt` and `cur`, while updating `tmp` to an empty string.
