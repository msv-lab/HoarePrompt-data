Output State: `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'z', `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Explanation: The loop runs for `k` iterations. After the loop completes its execution, the value of `i` will be equal to `k-1`. In the given scenario, since we observe the state after 3 iterations, it implies that `k` must be at least 3. The variable `cur` remains 0 throughout the loop because none of the bits in `cur` (which starts as 0) are being set to 1 during the loop iterations. The variable `tmp` is updated with the character corresponding to the current iteration index, and since the loop has completed, `tmp` will hold the character 'd' (which corresponds to the third iteration). The variables `cnt` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
