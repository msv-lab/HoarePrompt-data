Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `s` is an empty string.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cnt` is less than `n`.
   - `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.
   - `i` is 0.
   - If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, then `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   - The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `tmp`) are not directly affected by the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

4. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `s` remains an empty string.
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `cnt` remains less than `n`.
   - `ans` remains a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - The condition `if cur & 1 << i == 0` needs to be checked with `i = 1`. If `cur & 1 << 1 == 0`, then `tmp` will be `chr(ord('a') + 1)`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 1, and if `cur & 1 << 1 == 0`, then `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + 1)`**.
