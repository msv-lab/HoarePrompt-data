Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 << `cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, the current value of `cur & 1 << `cur_ss` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Given that the initial value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` was 0, and since `1 << cur_ss` is being added to `cur`, the new value of `cur` will be `1 << cur_ss`. This means that the bitwise AND operation between `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` will now yield 1, indicating that the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is set in `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
