Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k` used in the `range(k)` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, the initial value of `i` should be 0.

3. **Determine the Value of `k`**: The value of `k` is already given as part of the initial state and does not change within the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and that `k` remains consistent with its initial state.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `k` retains its initial state (no adjustment needed).

Therefore, the modified state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, `i` is 0**.
