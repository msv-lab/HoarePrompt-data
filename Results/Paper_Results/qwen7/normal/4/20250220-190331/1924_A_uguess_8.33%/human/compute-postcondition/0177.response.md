Output State: **`tmp` is 'e', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, `k` retains its initial state.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends to the string `ans` the character 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Given the initial state, `ans` was initially a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. After appending 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, `ans` now consists of these characters followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. All other variables remain unchanged.
