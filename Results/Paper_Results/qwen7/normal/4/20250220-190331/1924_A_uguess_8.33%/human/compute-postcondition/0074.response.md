Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0**.

Explanation: Initially, `cur` is set to `(1 << k) - 1`, where `k` is the value of `cur_ss` plus one. However, the code snippet simply assigns `0` to `cur`. This means that regardless of the initial value of `cur`, after executing the code, `cur` is now `0`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged at `1`.
