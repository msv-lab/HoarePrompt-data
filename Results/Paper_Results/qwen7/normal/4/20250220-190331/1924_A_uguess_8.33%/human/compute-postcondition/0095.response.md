Output State: **cnt is 3, cur is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cnt` will be the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met. Given that the loop has executed 3 times and each time it increments `cnt` when `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` will be 3. At the end of all iterations, `cur` will reset to 0 because the loop resets `cur` to 0 whenever `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`. Therefore, the final state of the variables is `cnt` being 3 and `cur` being 0.
