Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer that was initially set as the upper limit for the loop, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index `i - 1` of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop continues to increment `i` until it no longer satisfies the condition `i <= n - 1`. The variable `j` remains 1 because the condition `q == i + 1` never evaluates to true during any iteration of the loop, so the `break` statement is never reached. The values of `p` and `q` will depend on the specific values in the list `l` and the current value of `i` during the last iteration of the loop.
