Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`
- `j` is 1
- `p` is `l[n-1]`
- `q` is `l[p - 1]`
- The condition `j == 0` is true.

However, the condition `j == 0` being true does not affect the execution of the `print(3)` statement because the `print` function itself does not depend on the value of `j`. The `print` statement will simply output the integer 3.

Output: **3**
