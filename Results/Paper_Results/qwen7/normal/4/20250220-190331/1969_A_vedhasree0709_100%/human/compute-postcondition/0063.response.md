Output State: **`i` is 3; `p` is `l[3]`; `q` is `l[1]`; `q` is updated to `l[l[3] - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` updates the value of `q` to be the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. Given the initial state where `p` is `l[3]`, the new value of `q` becomes `l[l[3] - 1]`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
