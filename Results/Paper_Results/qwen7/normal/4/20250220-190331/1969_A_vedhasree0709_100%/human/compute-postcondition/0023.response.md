Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 2 of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`, and if `q` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
