Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned within the provided code snippet, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
