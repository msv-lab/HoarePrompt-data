Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n]`, `q` is `l[l[n]]`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `n + 1`, `j` is still 1, `p` is still `l[n]`, and `q` is still `l[l[n]]`. The new value of `n` is the integer input provided by the user.
