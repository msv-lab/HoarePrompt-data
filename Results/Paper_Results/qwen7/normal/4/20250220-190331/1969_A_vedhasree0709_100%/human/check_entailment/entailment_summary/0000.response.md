Reasoning:
- The program aims to find the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
- The logic in the provided program is flawed:
  - It only checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `p[q-1] == i+1` where `q = p[i]`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2`.
  - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, which is incorrect. The actual solution should check for cycles and ensure at least 2 friends are invited.
- The program does not handle cases where there are cycles involving more than 2 friends correctly. For example, in the case `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, the program would incorrectly print `2` because it finds the pair `(4, 5)`, but it should consider the entire cycle and print `3`.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
