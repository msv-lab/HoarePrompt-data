Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 0**.

The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. Since `i`, `n`, and `l` were unaffected by the code, their states remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, `j` is now 0.
