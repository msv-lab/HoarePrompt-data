Output State: `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will have incremented until it exceeds `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `j` is set to 1 and remains unchanged once the condition `q == i + 1` is met inside the loop. The values of `p` and `q` depend on the last iteration's values of `i` and `n`, respectively, and thus `p` will be `l[n-1]` and `q` will be `l[p - 1]`.
