Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `p` is `l[i]`, `q` is `l[l[n]]`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value of `l[i]` to `p`. Since `i` is initially 0, `p` is now set to the first element of the list `l`. The values of `j`, `q`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged.
