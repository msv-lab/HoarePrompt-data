Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables (`i`, `l`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
