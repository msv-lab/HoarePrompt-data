Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`, and if `q == i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `j == 0` is true.**
