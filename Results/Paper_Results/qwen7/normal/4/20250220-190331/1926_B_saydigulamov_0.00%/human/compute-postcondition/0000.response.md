Output State: **`a` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` between 2 and 10, inclusive, followed by a grid of `n` rows and `n` columns containing '0's and '1's, with exactly one triangle or one square containing all '1's.**

Explanation: The code reads the first integer `a` which represents the number of test cases. This integer is read from input and assigned to `a`. The initial conditions about `t` and the structure of the test cases remain valid, but now `a` holds the specific number of test cases to process.
