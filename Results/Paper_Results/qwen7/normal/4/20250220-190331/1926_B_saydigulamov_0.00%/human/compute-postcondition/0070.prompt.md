You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of t test cases, each test case starts with an integer n followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `a` is the initial number of test cases, `i` takes on the value of the total number of test cases processed (which is equal to `a`), `b` is the concatenated string of all input strings from each test case, and `k` is a list where the first element is the total count of '1's in all test cases, and the second element is also the total count of '1's in all test cases. Since the condition `if k[0] == k[1]: print(k)` always holds true given the problem constraints (both elements of `k` will be equal as they represent the same total count), `k` will be printed after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by a grid of n rows and n columns consisting of '0's and '1's. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's. The function determines whether the shape formed by '1's is a triangle or a square and returns the type of shape found.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
