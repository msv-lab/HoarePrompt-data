Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `a`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `a` is at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

To ensure the loop can execute, `a` must be greater than 0. Since `a` is already within the range of 1 to 100, it satisfies this condition inherently. However, we need to explicitly state that `a` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can start.

3. **Initial values for `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range(a)` function. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

Based on these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must be greater than 0 (which it already is).
- `i` must be 0.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
