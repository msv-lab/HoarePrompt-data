Postcondition: `b` is the concatenation of all input strings from each iteration of the loop. The variable `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's found in all the input strings `b` across all iterations. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this equality holds true. If there is no else part, the condition remains unchanged.
