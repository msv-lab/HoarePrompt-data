Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` between 2 and 10, inclusive, followed by a grid of `n` rows and `n` columns containing '0's and '1's, with exactly one triangle or one square containing all '1's.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a must be greater than 0, i is the count of '1' in the string b, k is a list containing the count of '1' in the string b for each iteration of the loop, and b is the final input string from `input()` after all iterations. If the current value of k[0] is equal to the current value of k[1], the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` is the concatenation of all input strings from each iteration of the loop. The variable `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's found in all the input strings `b` across all iterations. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this equality holds true. If there is no else part, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: b is the concatenation of all input strings from each iteration of the loop, and k is a list containing the cumulative count of '1' characters found in any of the input strings. If the first element of k is equal to the second element of k, no change is made to k.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
