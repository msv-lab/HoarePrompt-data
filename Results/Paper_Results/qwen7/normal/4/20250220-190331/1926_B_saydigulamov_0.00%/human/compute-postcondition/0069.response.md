Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by a grid of n rows and n columns consisting of '0's and '1's. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's. The function determines whether the shape formed by '1's is a triangle or a square and returns the type of shape found.**
