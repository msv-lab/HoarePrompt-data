Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know that `h` is 2, `n` is -1, and `k` is a positive integer.
2. We also know that `costs` is a list with two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`.
3. Since `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, this condition is satisfied, but it doesn't affect the values in the `costs` list directly.

Given the `costs` list:
- The first element is `1 - k`.
- The second element is `1`.

Therefore, the `costs` list is `[1 - k, 1]`.

The `print(*costs)` statement will unpack the list and print its elements separated by spaces.

Output: **1 - k 1**
