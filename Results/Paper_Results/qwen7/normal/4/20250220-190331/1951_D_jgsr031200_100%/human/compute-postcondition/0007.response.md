Based on the initial state provided, `n` and `k` are positive integers where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}`, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the current value of `n` is less than `k`. The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no variables or objects within the print statement depend on the values of `n` or `k`, and the print statement itself does not change any values, the output will be the literal string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
