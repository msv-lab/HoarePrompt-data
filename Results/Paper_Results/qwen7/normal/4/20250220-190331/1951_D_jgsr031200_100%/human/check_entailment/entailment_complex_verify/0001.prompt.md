You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `h` remains 2 because each iteration adds `n // i` to `h` and decreases `n` by `i * curr`. The loop terminates when `n` becomes less than the smallest element in `costs`, which is 1. Since `n` is reduced to -1, it means that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The `costs` list also remains unchanged as it was not modified during the loop's execution.

        print('NO')

        print(*costs)
        #This is printed: 1 - k 1
    #State: `h` is 2, `n` is -1, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is [1 - k, 1]. If `h` is less than `k`, no changes occur. If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, no changes occur either since the loop does not modify these variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, n and k, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If n equals k, the function prints 'YES', then prints 1 three times, and returns k. If n is less than k, the function prints 'NO' and returns None. If n is greater than or equal to k, the function calculates the minimum number of operations required to reduce n to a non-positive value using the values in the list [n - k + 1, 1], and prints 'YES', 2, the list [n - k + 1, 1], and 'NO' if the calculated number of operations (h) is less than k. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function returns None in all cases except when n equals k.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from the lowest priced stall to the highest.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is because Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is a heuristic approach to distribute the cost across two stalls.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - If the total number of stalls needed is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - The heuristic approach used in `func_1` might not always find a solution, but it is a reasonable attempt to solve the problem within the constraints.
   - However, the heuristic approach may fail in some edge cases, especially when the exact distribution of prices is required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle all edge cases, particularly when the exact distribution of prices is necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - The heuristic approach might not always find a valid solution, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The given code attempts to solve the problem but does not guarantee correctness in all scenarios. Therefore, the code is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
