### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from the lowest priced stall to the highest.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is because Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is a heuristic approach to distribute the cost across two stalls.
     - `costs[0] = n - k + 1`: This ensures that Alice can buy at least one jewel from the first stall.
     - `costs[1] = 1`: This ensures that Alice cannot buy any more jewels from the second stall after buying from the first stall.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - If the total number of stalls needed is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - The heuristic approach used in `func_1` is a reasonable attempt to solve the problem within the constraints. Specifically, setting the prices in such a way that Alice buys exactly one jewel from the first stall and no more from the second stall ensures that the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k` if `n >= k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `n == k` and `n < k`.
   - For the general case where `n >= k`, the heuristic approach ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting the prices appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels if `n >= k`. The heuristic approach used in `func_1` guarantees that the solution is correct in all valid scenarios.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
