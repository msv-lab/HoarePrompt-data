### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as inputs.
   - It checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If true, it prints "YES", 1, 1, and returns `k`.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it proceeds to calculate the minimum number of stalls needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Stalls:**
   - The function calculates the minimum number of operations (`h`) required to reduce `n` to a non-positive value using the values in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints "YES", 2, and the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n == k`, the function correctly prints "YES" and returns `k`.
   - When `n < k`, the function correctly prints "NO".
   - When `n >= k`, the function correctly calculates the minimum number of stalls and prints the appropriate output.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

- **Case 1: \( n = k \)**
  - The function prints "YES", 1, 1, and returns `k`.
  - This is correct because Alice already has the exact number of jewels she needs.

- **Case 2: \( n < k \)**
  - The function prints "NO".
  - This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

- **Case 3: \( n \geq k \)**
  - The function calculates the minimum number of stalls required to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - The calculation uses the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
  - This is correct because:
    - If `n - k + 1` is used as the price, Alice will buy 1 jewel and be left with `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins.
    - Repeating this process ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly handles all edge cases and logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
