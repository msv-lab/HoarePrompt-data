Output State: **The program returns None**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not contain any return statement with a value. In Python, if a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns `None` by default. Given the initial state where `n` and `k` are positive integers with specific conditions, the absence of a return statement means the function returns `None`.
