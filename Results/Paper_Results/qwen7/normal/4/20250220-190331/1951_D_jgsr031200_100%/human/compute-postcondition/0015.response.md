Output State: **`h` is `n // i`, `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. Here, `curr` is not defined in the initial state, but since `h` is initially `n // i`, we can infer that `curr` might be `h` (as it's the only logical variable related to `n` and `i`). So, `n` is updated to `n - i * h`. The values of `h`, `k`, and `costs` remain unchanged.
