Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is a positive integer; `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.**

This means that the variable `n` and `k` retain their initial conditions where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`. The new list `costs` is initialized with two elements: the first element is the value of `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.
