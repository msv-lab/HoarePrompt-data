Output State: **`h` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`, `curr` is `n // i`**.

This means that the variable `curr` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `i` using integer division. The other variables retain their initial states.
