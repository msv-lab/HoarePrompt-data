Reasoning:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n == k`, the program correctly prints 'YES', followed by 1 three times, and then `k`. This matches the expected output.
   - **Case 2**: When `n < k`, the program correctly prints 'NO' and returns `None`. This also matches the expected output.
   - **Case 3**: When `n >= k`, the program attempts to calculate the number of stalls needed using the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Instead, it tries to minimize the number of operations to reduce `n` to zero using the given list, which does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It only checks if `n` can be reduced to zero using the given list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and does not consider the greedy nature of Alice's purchasing behavior across multiple stalls.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example given in the problem statement:
     - **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
       - Expected Output: `YES`, 10 stalls with prices `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]`.
       - Actual Output: `YES`, 1, 1.
     - **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
       - Expected Output: `NO`.
       - Actual Output: `NO`.
     - **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
       - Expected Output: `YES`, 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.
       - Actual Output: `YES`, 2, `[2, 1]`.

   From the above examples, it is clear that the function does not generate the correct number of stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
