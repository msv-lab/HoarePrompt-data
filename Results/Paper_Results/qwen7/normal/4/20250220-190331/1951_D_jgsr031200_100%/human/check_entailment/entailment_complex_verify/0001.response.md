### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from the lowest priced stall to the highest.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", `1`, and `1`. This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is because Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is a heuristic approach to distribute the cost across two stalls.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and checks if the total number of jewels bought is at least `k`.
   - If the total number of stalls needed is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling `n == k` and `n < k` is correct.
   - The heuristic approach used in `func_1` might not always find a solution, but it is a reasonable attempt to solve the problem within the constraints.
   - However, the heuristic approach may fail in some edge cases, especially when the exact distribution of prices is required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle all edge cases, particularly when the exact distribution of prices is necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels.
   - The heuristic approach might not always find a valid solution, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- **Case 1: \(n == k\)**:
  - The code correctly prints "YES", `1`, and `1`, indicating that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if she has exactly `k` coins.
- **Case 2: \(n < k\)**:
  - The code correctly prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible for Alice to buy any jewels if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.
- **Case 3: \(n \geq k\)**:
  - The code initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and sums them up.
  - If the sum of the number of jewels bought is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two prices.

### Specific Issues:
- **Heuristic Approach**: The heuristic approach `[n - k + 1, 1]` might not always find a valid solution. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 8`, the heuristic would suggest prices `[2, 1]`, but this would only allow Alice to buy 7 jewels (3 from the first stall and 4 from the second), which is not enough.
- **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle cases where the exact distribution of prices is required to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not guarantee correctness in all scenarios. While it handles some basic cases correctly, it fails in more complex scenarios where the exact distribution of prices is necessary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
