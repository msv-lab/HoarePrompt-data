Output State: `h` is 2, `n` is -1, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is [1 - k, 1].

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `h` remains 2 because each iteration increments `h` by `curr`, which is `n // i` for the first iteration and then becomes 0 for subsequent iterations. The value of `n` becomes -1 because it is reduced by `i * curr` in each iteration, and `curr` becomes 0 after the first iteration when `n` is no longer divisible by `i`. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The `costs` list also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
