First, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State:
  - `h` is 2
  - `n` is `n - 1 * (n // 1)`. Since `n // 1` is `n` (as `n` is an integer), `n` becomes `n - n`, which is `0`.
  - `k` is a positive integer
  - `costs` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`. Given `n` is now `0`, the first element of `costs` is `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
  - `i` is `1`
  - `curr` is `n // 1`, which is `0`.

The code snippet is:
```python
h += curr
```
This means `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`. Since `curr` is `0`, `h` remains unchanged.

So, after executing the code, the values of the variables are:
- `h` is still `2`
- `n` is `0`
- `k` is still a positive integer
- `costs` is still `[1 - k, 1]`
- `i` is still `1`
- `curr` is still `0`

Output State: **`h` is 2, `n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is [1 - k, 1], `i` is 1, `curr` is 0**
