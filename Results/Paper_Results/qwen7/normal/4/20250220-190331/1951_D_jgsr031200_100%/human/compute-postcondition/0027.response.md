Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is explicitly given as -1.
- `k` is a positive integer but its exact value is not specified.
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `[1 - k, 1]`.
- `h` is less than `k`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
