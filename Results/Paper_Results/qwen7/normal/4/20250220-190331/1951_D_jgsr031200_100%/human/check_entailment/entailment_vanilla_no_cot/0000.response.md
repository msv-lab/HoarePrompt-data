Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The solution only considers two specific cases (`n == k` and `n < k`) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. However, the problem requires setting up to 60 stalls with specific prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Stall Prices**: The current implementation calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall but does not ensure that the total number of jewels bought equals `k`. It also does not handle the scenario where more than one stall is needed to achieve the exact count of `k` jewels.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic inside `func_1` does not properly distribute the number of stalls and their respective prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, the calculation of `h` and `curr` does not align with the requirement to set up stalls with specific prices.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Determine the number of stalls required.
- Set the price for each stall such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when she buys greedily from each stall.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # If n is less than k, it's impossible to buy k jewels
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        continue
    
    # We need to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels
    # We can use a greedy approach to set the prices
    stalls = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    current_stall_price = 1
    
    for i in range(60):
        if remaining_jewels == 0:
            break
        
        # Calculate how many jewels can be bought from this stall
        jewels_bought = min(n // current_stall_price, remaining_jewels)
        
        # Update the number of jewels remaining
        remaining_jewels -= jewels_bought
        
        # Add the stall price to the list
        stalls.append(current_stall_price)
        
        # Move to the next stall price
        current_stall_price += 1
    
    if remaining_jewels != 0:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(" ".join(map(str, stalls)))
```

This solution ensures that the number of stalls and their prices are set correctly to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.
