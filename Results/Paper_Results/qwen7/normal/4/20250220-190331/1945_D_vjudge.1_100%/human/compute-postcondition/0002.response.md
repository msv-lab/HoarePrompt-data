Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `-1`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is initially `n - 1`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer such that the loop can execute.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` should be `n - 1`.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

The other variables (`c`, `suff`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer**
