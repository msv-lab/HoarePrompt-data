Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, and `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`, and `b` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9`.**

This means that the list `c` has been created by taking the minimum value between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
