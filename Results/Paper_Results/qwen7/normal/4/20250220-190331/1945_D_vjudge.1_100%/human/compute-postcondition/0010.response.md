Output State: **`i` is 0, `suff[0]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `ans` is infinity.**

Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. In each iteration, `suff[i]` is updated to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. By the time `i` becomes `0`, `suff[0]` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in `c` because each `c[i]` is added to `suff[i + 1]` as `i` decreases from `n - 1` to `0`. The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity and does not change during the loop, so it remains `float('inf')`.
