Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` becomes `-1`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

### Next Iteration:
- Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i >= -1`, which means `i` should be at least `-1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be `n - 2`.
- `suff[i]` will be calculated as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`, where `i + 1` will be `n - 1`.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `n - 2`.
- `suff[i]` will be `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `suff[i]` is `suff[n - 1] + c[n - 2]`**
