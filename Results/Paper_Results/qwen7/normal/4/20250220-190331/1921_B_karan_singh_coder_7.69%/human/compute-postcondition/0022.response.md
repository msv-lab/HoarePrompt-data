Output State: **`cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`; `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer converted to an integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `n-1`.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
