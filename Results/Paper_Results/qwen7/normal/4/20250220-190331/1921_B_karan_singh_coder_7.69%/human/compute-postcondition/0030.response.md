Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. This means `i` is incremented within the loop, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `i` is the current index being processed.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `cnt` remains the same unless `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` during the next iteration.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is not explicitly provided in terms of `s` and `t`, we focus on the variables directly involved in the loop head: `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect:
- `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains unchanged.

If we denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`, then the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**.
