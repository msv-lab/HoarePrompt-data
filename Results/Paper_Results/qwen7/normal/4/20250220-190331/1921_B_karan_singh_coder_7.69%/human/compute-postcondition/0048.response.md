Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is the last index that was checked (which is `n-1`), `n` is reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`), the strings `s` and `t` remain the same as they were after the last iteration, `s1` is the count of '1's in string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in string `t`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `t`, `s1`, or `t1`. The values of these variables remain as they were after the last iteration, with `i` being the last index that was checked and `n` being reduced to the number of iterations performed (which is `i+1`).
