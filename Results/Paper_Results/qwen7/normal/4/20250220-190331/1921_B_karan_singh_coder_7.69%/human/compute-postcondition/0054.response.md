Output State: **`cnt` is `cnt + (s[i] != t[i]) + 1`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` is `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by the value of `s[i] != t[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, so the new value of `i` becomes `i + 2`. Since `n` was initially defined as `i + 2`, it remains unchanged. The updated value of `cnt` is the original `cnt` plus the value of `s[i] != t[i]` plus 1 due to the increment of `i`.
