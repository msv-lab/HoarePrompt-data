Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Given the initial state where `i` must be less than `n` and `n` is `i + 1`, these conditions remain true after the code execution. The only change is that `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the condition `s[i] != t[i]` is met.
