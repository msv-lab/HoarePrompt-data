Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` initially. Since `i` is set to `n-1`, this condition is already met.
   - However, if `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all because `i` would be `-1`, which is not less than `0`.

Given the above points, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `cnt` is 0 (not relevant for the loop execution).
- `t1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` (not relevant for the loop execution).
- `t` is a string input by the user (not relevant for the loop execution).
- `s1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` (not relevant for the loop execution).
- `s` is updated to the string input by the user (not relevant for the loop execution).

Therefore, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than 0**
