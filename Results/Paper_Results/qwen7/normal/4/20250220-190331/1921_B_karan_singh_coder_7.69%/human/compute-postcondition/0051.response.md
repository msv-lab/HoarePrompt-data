Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `n` is `i + 1`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is defined as `i + 1` at the start of each iteration.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `n` will also change.

3. **Variable `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is updated based on the condition `s[i] != t[i]`.
   - This variable is not directly controlled by the loop itself but is updated within the loop body.

### Adjusting States:
- We need to update `i` and `n` for the next iteration.
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` will be updated to `i + 1`.

### New State:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` will be `(i + 1) + 1 = i + 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is `i + 2`**.

This means:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` is now `i + 2`.
- `cnt` remains unchanged unless the condition `s[i] != t[i]` is met in the next iteration.
