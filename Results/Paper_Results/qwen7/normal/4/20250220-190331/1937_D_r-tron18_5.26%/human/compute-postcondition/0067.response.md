Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise equal to the length of `pre`; `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list containing indices `i+1` for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes the last element; `suffZero` is a list containing the value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `i - 1 + 1 = i`; `el` is equal to `s1[i]`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is assigned the value `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates `oneInd` by calculating `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. It does not affect the values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, or `zeroInd` from the previous state. `func_1` is called with arguments `suffZero` and `ol`, and its result is used in the calculation of `oneInd`. The values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd` remain unchanged from their previous states.
