Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr), ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` for each i.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `ans` list. For each index `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. However, the values of `fi` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` (which gives the value of `oneInd`) are not specified. Therefore, we keep them as expressions.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
