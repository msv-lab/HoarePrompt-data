Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1), `ans` is a list of n zeros with the i-th element updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1` which is not equal to '>', `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `oneInd` is twice the last element of `preOne`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` list by setting the i-th element to `zeroInd - oneInd`. Since `zeroInd` is `suffZero[i]` and `oneInd` is `preOne[-1] * 2`, the i-th element of `ans` is now `suffZero[i] - 2 * preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
