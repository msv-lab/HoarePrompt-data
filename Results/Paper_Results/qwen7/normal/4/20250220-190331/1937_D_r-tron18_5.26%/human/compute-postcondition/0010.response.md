Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 times the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `zeroInd` the value of twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Since `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, and `ol` is `totalOne`, the value of `zeroInd` is determined by the function `func_1([0], totalOne)`. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only express `zeroInd` in terms of the function's return value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
