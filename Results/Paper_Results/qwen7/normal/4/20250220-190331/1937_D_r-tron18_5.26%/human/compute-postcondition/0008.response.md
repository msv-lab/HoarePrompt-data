Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `totalOne` to `ol` and `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. Since `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, its length `len(suffZero)` is 1. Therefore, `zr` is `1 - 1`, which is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
