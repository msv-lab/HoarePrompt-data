Postcondition: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. 

- If `ol <= zr`, then `zeroInd` is 2 times the value returned by `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the value returned by `func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` for each index `i`.
- Otherwise, `zeroInd` is 0, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` for each index `i`.
