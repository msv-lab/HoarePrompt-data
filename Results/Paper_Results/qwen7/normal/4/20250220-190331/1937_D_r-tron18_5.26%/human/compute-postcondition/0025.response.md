Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1), `ans` is a list of n zeros, `el` is the character at index `i` in `s1`, and `el` is not equal to '>', `suffZero` is updated by appending the value of the last element in `suffZero` plus the current index (i+1).**

In more detail, the code appends the value of the last element in `suffZero` plus the current index (i+1) to the list `suffZero`. Since `suffZero` initially contains only the value 0, the first time this line of code is executed, `suffZero` will become `[0 + (i + 1)]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
