Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and computes a list `ans` where each element represents the balance of '<' and '>' characters up to that position in the string. Specifically, for each character in `s1`, it calculates the difference between the count of '>' characters seen so far and the count of '<' characters seen so far, adjusted by the remaining indices. The function then prints the list `ans`.**
