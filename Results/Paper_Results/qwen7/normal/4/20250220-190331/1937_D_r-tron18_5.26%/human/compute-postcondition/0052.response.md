Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is either `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` or `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is either `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` or `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `preOne` is reduced by one element (the last element is removed).**

Explanation: The code `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `ol` is updated to `totalOne - 1`, while `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` retain their original expressions. Additionally, `preOne` loses its last element due to the subtraction operation.
