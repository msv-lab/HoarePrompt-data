Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `preOne` using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module, which accumulates the sum of elements in `pre`. The `initial=0` parameter ensures that the accumulation starts from 0. Since `pre` contains indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` will contain the cumulative sum of these indices starting from 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
