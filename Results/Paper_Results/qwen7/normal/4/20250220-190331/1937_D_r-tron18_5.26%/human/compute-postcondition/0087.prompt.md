Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0, `ans` is a list of n zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1 if the character `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`. `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes the last element. `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1). `ans` is a list of `n` zeros. Depending on the condition `len(suffZero) - 1 <= totalOne`, the i-th element of `ans` is either updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)` if `len(suffZero) - 1 <= totalOne`, or twice the last element of `preOne` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise equal to the length of `pre`. `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list containing indices `i+1` for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` excluding the last element if `el` is '>', otherwise it includes the last element; `suffZero` is a list containing the value `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `suffZero` including the current index (i+1); `ans` is a list of `n` zeros. Depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `ans[i]` is either updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is equal to `s1[i]`; `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is equal to `totalOne`; `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are updated according to the respective conditions in the if and else parts.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `totalOne` is adjusted based on whether `el` is '>' or not. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is the length of `pre` minus 2, otherwise it is the length of `pre` minus 1. `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` and `preOne` lists are updated according to the value of `el`. `suffZero` is updated by appending `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros. `i` remains unchanged. `el` remains the same as `s1[i]`. `suffZero` now has one more element. `ol` and `zr` are updated based on the length of `suffZero`. `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are updated according to the conditions specified in the if and else parts.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
