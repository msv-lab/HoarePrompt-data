Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to 1, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**.

The code `pow = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `pow`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
