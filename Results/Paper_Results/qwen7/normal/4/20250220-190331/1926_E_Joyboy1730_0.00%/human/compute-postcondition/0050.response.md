The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero (i.e., `n > 0`). At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be set to a value that ensures `n > 0` after decrementing by 2.

Given that `n` was `n - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `n` must be such that when it is decremented by 2, it still remains positive. This means the original value of `n` before decrementing by 2 must have been at least 2.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 after the decrement operation.

State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `tot` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 2**
