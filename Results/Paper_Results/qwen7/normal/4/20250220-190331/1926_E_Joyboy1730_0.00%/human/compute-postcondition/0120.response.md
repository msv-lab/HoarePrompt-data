Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L`. The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `L`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2.
   - `k` is updated to `k - tot`.
   - `tot` remains unchanged.
   - `L` is a list with at least 1 element.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `L`. After each iteration, `a` takes the value of the next element in the list `L`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` is the variable that changes with each iteration, it will take the value of the next element in the list `L`.
   - The list `L` itself does not change; it still contains at least one element.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `pow` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` is updated to `k - tot` from the previous iteration.
   - `tot` remains unchanged.
   - `L` must still contain at least one element, but since we are moving to the next iteration, it means there is at least one more element left in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`pow` is multiplied by 2, `k` is `k - tot`, `tot` remains unchanged, `L` is a list with at least 2 elements**.
