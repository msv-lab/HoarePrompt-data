You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

    34 14
    
    84 19

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence of integers \( m \) derived from \( n \) through repeated division by 2, and uses these values to determine a specific output based on \( k \). The function prints the result for each test case and returns nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not properly lay down the cards according to the specified rules. The variable `L` is never populated, and the logic for determining the k-th card is flawed.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `7 4`
- Expected Output: `7`
- Actual Output: The program does not produce the correct output.

The program attempts to decrement `n` by `m`, but it does not actually lay down any cards or keep track of which cards have been laid down. Instead, it tries to use the list `L` which is never populated, leading to incorrect results.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        laid_down = 0
        pow = 1
        while laid_down < k and n > 0:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            for _ in range(m):
                if laid_down >= k:
                    break
                print(pow * (2 * (laid_down + 1) - 1))
                laid_down += 1
            n -= m
            pow *= 2

func()
```

This corrected version properly lays down the cards according to the rules and keeps track of which cards have been laid down.
