Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is not used correctly in the context of the problem. This calculation does not contribute to the logic needed to solve the problem.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `L` and `tot`**: The list `L` and the variable `tot` are not used correctly. The logic for determining the k-th card should not involve these variables.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the k-th Card**: The loop that iterates over `L` and checks conditions using `tot` and `k` is not set up correctly. It seems to be trying to find the k-th card but does not follow the correct logic for the problem.

4. **Missing Key Logic**: The program lacks the core logic required to determine the sequence in which the cards are laid down according to the rules specified in the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the process of laying down the cards according to the given rules. We can do this by iterating through the multiples of increasing odd numbers and keeping track of the count of cards laid down until we reach the k-th card.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while count < k:
            if (i % 2 == 1):  # Check if the number is odd
                for j in range(1, n + 1):
                    multiple = i * j
                    if multiple > n:
                        break
                    count += 1
                    if count == k:
                        print(multiple)
                        break
            i += 1

func()
```

This version correctly simulates the process of laying down the cards according to the specified rules and finds the k-th card.
