You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `L` will be a list containing all the values of `m` generated during each iteration, `pow` will be equal to \(2^n\) where \(n\) is the total number of iterations, `k` will be reduced to a non-positive value (since it is continuously subtracted by `tot` until it is no longer positive), `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`, and `m`, `n`, and `a` will be undefined.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `L` will contain all the values of `m` that were calculated during each iteration. The variable `pow` will be \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the total number of iterations. The variable `k` will be non-positive, as it is continually reduced by `tot` until it reaches zero or becomes negative. The variable `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`. The variables `m`, `n`, and `a` will be undefined since they are local to the loop and are no longer in scope after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initial Processing:**
   - The variable `L` is initialized as an empty list.
   - A while loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0. Inside this loop:
     - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
     - `n` is updated by subtracting `m`.
   - This loop seems to be calculating how many odd-numbered cards can be placed in the current iteration, but it does not store these values in `L`. Instead, it updates `n` to reflect the remaining cards after placing the odd-numbered cards.

3. **Calculating Total Cards Laid Down:**
   - Variables `tot` and `pow` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - A for loop iterates over the elements in `L`, which is still an empty list.
   - If `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, the program prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)` and breaks out of the loop.
   - `tot` is incremented by `a`, and `k` is adjusted by subtracting `tot`.
   - `pow` is doubled in each iteration.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Empty List `L`:**
   - The list `L` is never populated with any values. The while loop inside the function does not add any elements to `L`, making the subsequent for loop ineffective since `L` remains empty.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the k-th Card:**
   - The logic to find the k-th card is flawed because `L` is not populated correctly. The program attempts to find the k-th card using an empty list, which will always result in an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the k-th card according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
