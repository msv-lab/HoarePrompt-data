Output State: **`k` is decreased by `tot`, `pow` is 8, `m` and `n` remain unchanged, and `tot` is increased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` doubles the value of `pow`. Since the initial value of `pow` was 4, after executing the code, `pow` becomes 8. The values of `k`, `m`, `n`, `tot`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
