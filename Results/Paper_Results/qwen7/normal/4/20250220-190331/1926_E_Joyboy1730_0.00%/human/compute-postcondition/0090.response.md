The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Right before the loop, `n` is 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be non-zero for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is \(2^n\), `k` is an input integer, `m` and `n` must be non-zero, and `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.**
