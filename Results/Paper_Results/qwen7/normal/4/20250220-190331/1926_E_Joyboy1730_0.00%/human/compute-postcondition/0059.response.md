Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, and `n` is 0.**

The code `pow = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `pow`. Since `pow` was already 1 in the initial state, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`L`, `k`, `m`, `tot`, `n`) are not affected by this line of code.
