Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
            break
        tot += a
        k -= tot
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `pow` will be equal to \(2^{|L|}\), where \(|L|\) is the length of the list `L`. The variable `n` will still be 0, `k` will be 0, `L` will be an empty list, `m` will still be 1, `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`, and `a` will be undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `k` is less than `tot`. After all iterations, `L` will remain as it was filled during the loop's execution, `pow` will be \(2^n\) where \(n\) is the number of times the loop executed, `k` will be less than or equal to `tot`, `m` and `n` will remain 0, and `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `L` will retain its final state from the last iteration, `pow` will be \(2^n\) with \(n\) being the total number of iterations, `k` will be less than or equal to the total sum of elements in `L`, `m` and `n` will still be 0, and `tot` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `L` is a list with at least 3 elements, `pow` is multiplied by \(2^n\) where \(n\) is the number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is updated to `k - n * tot`, `tot` is incremented by the last element `a` added to the list `L`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `L` will contain at least as many elements as the number of times the loop ran. The variable `pow` will be equal to the initial value of `pow` multiplied by \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the total number of iterations. The variable `k` will be updated to `k - n * tot`, reflecting the cumulative reduction in `k` over each iteration. The variable `tot` will be incremented by the last element `a` added to the list `L` during the loop's final iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
