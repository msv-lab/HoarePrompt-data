Output State: **`pow` will be equal to \(2^{|L|}\), where \(|L|\) is the length of the list `L`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `L` will be an empty list, `m` will still be 1, `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`, and `a` will be undefined.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them by space, and converts them into integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The other variables (`pow`, `L`, `m`, `tot`, `a`) remain unchanged.
