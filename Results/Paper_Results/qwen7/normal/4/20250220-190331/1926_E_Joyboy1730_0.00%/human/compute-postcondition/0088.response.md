`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts the input into two integers. The values of `pow`, `k`, `m`, `n`, and `tot` are not affected by this operation. The output state is: `L` retains its final state from the last iteration, `pow` is \(2^n\) where \(n\) is the number of times the loop has executed so far, `k` is an input integer, `m` and `n` are 0, and `tot` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `L`.
