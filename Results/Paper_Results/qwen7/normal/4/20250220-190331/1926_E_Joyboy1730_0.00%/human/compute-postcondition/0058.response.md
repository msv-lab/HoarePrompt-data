Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, and `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The given code snippet simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tot`. Since `tot` was already 0 in the initial state, its value does not change. The loop condition and the operations within the loop do not affect `tot`. The values of the other variables (`L`, `pow`, `k`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations are performed on them in the provided code snippet.
