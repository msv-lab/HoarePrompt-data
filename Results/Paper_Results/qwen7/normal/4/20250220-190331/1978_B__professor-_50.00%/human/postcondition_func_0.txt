The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and prints a result based on these inputs according to specific conditions. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with `n` terms divided by 2. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the first part of an arithmetic series from `b - a` plus `a * n`. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the last set of inputs provided.
