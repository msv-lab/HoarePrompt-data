Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, `a` is assigned the second integer from the input, `b` is assigned the third integer from the input. If `b - a >= n`, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
