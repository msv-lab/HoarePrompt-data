Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the calculation).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is updated to the first input integer.
- `a` is updated to the second input integer.
- `b` is updated to the third input integer.

The expression inside the `print` function is \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\).

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. `n` is the first input integer.
2. `b` is the third input integer.
3. Substitute these into the expression: \((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2\).

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{result} = \frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2} \]

This formula represents the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `b - 0.5` and the common difference is 1.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the result of this calculation.

Output: **(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2 (where n is the first input integer and b is the third input integer)**
