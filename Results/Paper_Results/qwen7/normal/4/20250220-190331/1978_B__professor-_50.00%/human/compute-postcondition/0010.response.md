Given the initial state and the formula in the print statement:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer, and `b` is less than or equal to `a`.

The expression in the print statement is:
\[ \text{int}\left(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\right) \]

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate `(b - a)`: Since `b` is less than or equal to `a`, this value will be non-positive (it could be zero if `b == a`).

2. Calculate `(b - a + 1)`: This will be one more than the previous result, making it non-negative.

3. Multiply these two results: \((b - a) \times (b - a + 1)\). This product will be non-positive because one of the factors is non-positive.

4. Divide the product by 2: \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}\). This will still be non-positive.

5. Add `a * n` to the result from step 4: Since `a` and `n` are integers, `a * n` is also an integer. Adding this to a non-positive number will still yield a non-positive number if `a * n` is non-positive, or a number with the same sign as `a * n` if it is positive.

6. Convert the result to an integer using `int()`: This step does not change the value since the result is already an integer.

Therefore, the expression evaluates to an integer that is either zero or negative depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * n)**
