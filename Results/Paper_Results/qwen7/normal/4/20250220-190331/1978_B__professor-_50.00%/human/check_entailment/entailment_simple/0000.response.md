Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic inside the function checks different conditions to determine the maximum profit:
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price gives the maximum profit.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. This is because selling the first `n` buns at the modified prices gives the maximum profit.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, plus the remaining buns sold at the usual price `a`.

4. The formulas used in the code are mathematically sound and correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
