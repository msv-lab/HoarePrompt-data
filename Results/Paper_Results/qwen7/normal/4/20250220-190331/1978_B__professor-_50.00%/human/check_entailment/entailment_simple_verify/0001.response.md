### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - The program uses an `if-elif-else` structure to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `b` and `a`, and the value of `n`.

3. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \):**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the program prints `n * a`.
   - This is correct because if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.

4. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n - 1)`. However, this formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` with a common difference of `-1` is:
     \[
     S_k = \frac{k}{2} \left(2b - (k - 1)\right)
     \]
     Here, `k = n`, so the correct formula should be:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left(2b - (n - 1)\right) = \frac{n}{2} (2b - n + 1)
     \]
     Therefore, the program should print \(\frac{n}{2} (2b - n + 1)\).

5. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is less than the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \(b - a + 1\) terms (which is the number of buns sold at the modified price) plus the revenue from the remaining buns sold at the usual price. However, the formula \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2}\) is incorrect. The correct formula for the sum of the first \(k\) terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b - a + 1` with a common difference of `-1` is:
     \[
     S_k = \frac{k}{2} \left(2(b - a + 1) - (k - 1)\right)
     \]
     Here, \(k = b - a + 1\), so the correct formula should be:
     \[
     S_{b-a+1} = \frac{b - a + 1}{2} \left(2(b - a + 1) - (b - a)\right) = \frac{(b - a + 1)(b - a + 2)}{2}
     \]
     Therefore, the program should print \(\frac{(b - a + 1)(b - a + 2)}{2} + a * n\).

Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly handle the cases where \( b - a \geq n \) and \( b - a < n \). The formulas used in these cases are incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
