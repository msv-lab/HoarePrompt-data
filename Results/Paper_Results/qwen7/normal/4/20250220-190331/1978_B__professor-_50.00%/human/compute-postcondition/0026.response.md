Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `n` is updated to the first input integer.
- `a` is updated to the second input integer.
- `b` is updated to the third input integer.

The expression being evaluated in the `print` statement is:

\[ \text{int}\left(\frac{b - a}{2} \times (b - a + 1) + a \times n\right) \]

Let's break it down:

1. `b - a` gives the difference between the second and first input integers.
2. `b - a + 1` is this difference plus one.
3. \(\frac{b - a}{2} \times (b - a + 1)\) calculates the product of half the difference and the difference plus one.
4. This result is then added to \(a \times n\), where \(n\) is the first input integer.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to calculating a specific mathematical formula based on the inputs.

Output: **int(((input_integer_3 - input_integer_2) / 2 * (input_integer_3 - input_integer_2 + 1) + input_integer_2 * input_integer_1))**
