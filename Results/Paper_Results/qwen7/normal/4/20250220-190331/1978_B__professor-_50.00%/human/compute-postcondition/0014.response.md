Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no change occurs. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the condition holds as is, or `b` is adjusted so that the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`.
