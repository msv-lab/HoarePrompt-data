### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - The program uses an `if-elif-else` structure to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `b` and `a`, and the value of `n`.

3. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \):**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the program prints `n * a`.
   - This is correct because if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.

4. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n - 1)`. This is correct because it represents the total revenue from selling the first `n` buns at the modified prices.

5. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is less than the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \(b - a + 1\) terms (which is the number of buns sold at the modified price) plus the revenue from the remaining buns sold at the usual price. This is correct because it accounts for the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price to maximize profit.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used in Case 3. Let's break down the formula to ensure it is correct:

- The formula \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2}\) calculates the sum of the first \(b - a + 1\) terms of an arithmetic series starting from 1, which is not correct for the modified prices.
- The correct formula for the sum of the first \(k\) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \(b - a + 1\) with a common difference of -1 is:
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \left(2(b - a + 1) + (k - 1)(-1)\right) = \frac{k}{2} \left(2b - 2a + 2 - k + 1\right) = \frac{k}{2} \left(2b - 2a - k + 3\right)
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  \text{Sum} = \frac{k(2b - 2a - k + 3)}{2}
  \]

Thus, the correct formula should be:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 3 - n)}{2} + a * n
\]

Given this correction, the original assessment is partially correct but needs refinement. The formula in Case 3 is incorrect as stated.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but the formula in Case 3 is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
Final: **False**
