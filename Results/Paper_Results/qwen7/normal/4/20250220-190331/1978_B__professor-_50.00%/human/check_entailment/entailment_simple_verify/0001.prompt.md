You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the last set of inputs provided by the user for each iteration. The loop processes each of the `t` test cases sequentially, updating `n`, `a`, and `b` with the new inputs for each case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - The program uses an `if-elif-else` structure to handle different scenarios based on the relationship between `b` and `a`, and the value of `n`.

3. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \):**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the program prints `n * a`.
   - This is correct because if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.

4. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n - 1)`. This is correct because it represents the total revenue from selling the first `n` buns at the modified prices.

5. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \):**
   - If the difference between the modified price and the usual price is less than the number of buns `n`, the program prints \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first \(b - a + 1\) terms (which is the number of buns sold at the modified price) plus the revenue from the remaining buns sold at the usual price. This is correct because it accounts for the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price to maximize profit.

Given the analysis above, the program correctly handles all the specified cases and calculates the maximum profit accurately.
