Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[2]` (which is `b[j-1]`) does not equal `a[i+1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a string input by the user, and `k` remains 0.**

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially set to `m - 1`. After executing `j += 1`, `j` is now equal to `m`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
