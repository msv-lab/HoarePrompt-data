Output State: All iterations of the loop have completed, which means `j` equals `m`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `k` is the total count of matches found during the loop iterations. The value of `i` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has executed for each element in `a`.
