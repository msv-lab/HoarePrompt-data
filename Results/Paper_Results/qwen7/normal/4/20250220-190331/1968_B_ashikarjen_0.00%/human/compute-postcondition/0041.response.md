Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `b[j-2]` (which is `b[m-2]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `j + 2` (since it was initially `j + 1`). The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
