Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `b = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `a` was initially a string obtained from the input, which remains unchanged unless explicitly reassigned. Therefore, the output state includes the updated variable `b` along with the unchanged variables `t`, `n`, and `a`.
