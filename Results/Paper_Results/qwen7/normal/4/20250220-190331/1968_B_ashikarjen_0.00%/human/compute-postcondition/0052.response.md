Postcondition: **`j` is equal to `m`, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[m-1]`) does not equal `a[i]`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a user input string, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `j` reaches `m + 1`, `k` is increased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases: if `j` reaches `m + 1`, then `k` is incremented; otherwise, `j` remains at `m` and the loop terminates.
