Postcondition: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` must be at least 3, `b[j-1]` (which is `b[2]` if `j` is 3) must not be equal to `a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `b` is a string input by the user, `k` remains either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `j < m` was true or false, and the most internal loop or if statement has been exited.
