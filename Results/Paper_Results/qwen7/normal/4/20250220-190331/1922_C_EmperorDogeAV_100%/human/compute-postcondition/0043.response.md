Output State: **`back` is either `cities[i - 1]` if `i > 0`, or remains `-99999999999999999999`. `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, or remains `999999999999999999` if `i >= n - 1`. `prog_cities[1]` remains `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`. `prog_cities[i]` is updated to `abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])` if `i < n - 1`, or remains unchanged if `i >= n - 1`.**

This means that the value of `prog_cities[i]` is now the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the value of `prog_cities[i]` remains unchanged from its previous state. The other variables (`back`, `forward`, and `prog_cities[1]`) retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
