Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prog_cities` as a list of `n-1` zeros. The original list `cities` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `prog_cities` and retains the initial state of `cities`.
