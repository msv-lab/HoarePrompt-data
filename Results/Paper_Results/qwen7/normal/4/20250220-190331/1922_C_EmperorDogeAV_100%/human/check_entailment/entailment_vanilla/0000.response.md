Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost depends on whether you choose to move to the closest city or any other city.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to compute the distance to the closest city for each city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are lists that store these distances in forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, used to quickly calculate the sum of distances for any subarray.
   - Queries are answered using these prefix sums.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each city and calculates the distance to the closest city by comparing distances to the previous and next cities.
   - This logic seems correct for determining the closest city.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are correctly computed as prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

5. **Query Handling**:
   - The code correctly handles the queries by using the appropriate prefix sum arrays based on the direction of travel (forward or backward).
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost is sound.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where the city indices might be reversed in queries, ensuring the correct prefix sum is used.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
