Output State: **`i` is 0; `back` is -99999999999999999999**

The initial value of `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 2. The code simply assigns the value `-99999999999999999999` to the variable `back`. No other changes are made to the variables, so the output state retains the initial values of `i` and sets `back` to the specified value.
