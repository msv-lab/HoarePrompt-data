Output State: **`i` is 1, `back` is -99999999999999999999, `forward` is the value of `cities[1]`**

Explanation: The code does not change the value of `i`, `back`, or `forward`. It simply reassigns `back` to `-99999999999999999999`, which was its initial value. Therefore, the values of `i` and `forward` remain unchanged, and `back` retains its initial value.
