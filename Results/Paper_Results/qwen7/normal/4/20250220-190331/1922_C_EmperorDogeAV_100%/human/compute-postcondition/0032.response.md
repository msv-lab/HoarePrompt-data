Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2; `back` is `cities[0]`; `forward` is either `cities[2]` (if `i < n - 1`) or `back` remains `cities[0]` (if `i` is not less than `n - 1`); if `i` is 1, `prog_cities[1]` is 1; if `i` is 2, `prog_cities[1]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[1]`.
