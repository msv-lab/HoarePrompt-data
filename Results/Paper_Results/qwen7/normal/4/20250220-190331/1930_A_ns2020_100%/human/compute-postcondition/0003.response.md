Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `A`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
