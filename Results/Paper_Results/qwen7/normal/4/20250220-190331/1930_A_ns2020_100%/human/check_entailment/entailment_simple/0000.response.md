Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.

2. **Sorting**: The list `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a key step because it allows us to always pick the smallest available numbers when combining pairs, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.

3. **Summing Pairs**: After sorting, the program sums every other element in the list starting from the first element (`A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.). This is equivalent to summing the minimum of each pair `(A[i], A[i+1])` for `i` from `0` to `2n-2` in steps of `2`.

4. **Output**: The result of this summation is printed for each test case.

5. **Loop Control**: The loop continues until `t` becomes zero, ensuring that all test cases are processed.

Given these steps, the program correctly computes the maximum final score by always choosing the smallest available numbers when forming pairs, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
