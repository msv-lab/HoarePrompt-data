The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero. Given that `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 4999\) at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be adjusted to be non-zero.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**
