Output State: **`i` is 52, `x` must be greater than 51, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `x`, `n`, and `flag`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified, we assume it breaks out of the context implied by the initial conditions.
