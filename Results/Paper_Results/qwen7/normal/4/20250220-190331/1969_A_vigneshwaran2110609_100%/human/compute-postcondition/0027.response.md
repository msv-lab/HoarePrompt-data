Output State: **`i` is 50, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the input into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
