Output State: **`i` is 51, `x` must be greater than 51, `n` must be within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no loops or conditionals were specified in the context of this code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional we were in.
