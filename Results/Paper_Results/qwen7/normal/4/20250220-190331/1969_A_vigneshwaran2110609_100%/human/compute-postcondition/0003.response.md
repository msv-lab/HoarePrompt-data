Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a list from these integers. The original values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new list `l` is created based on the input provided.
