Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `p` is not modified by this operation. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition, and `n` is set to the input integer within the specified range. The list `p` remains as a list of n integers with the given conditions.
