Postcondition: `i` is 101, `x` is greater than 100, `n` is within the range [2, 50], `flag` is True, and `l` is a list of integers entered by the user. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no change occurs to the variables.
