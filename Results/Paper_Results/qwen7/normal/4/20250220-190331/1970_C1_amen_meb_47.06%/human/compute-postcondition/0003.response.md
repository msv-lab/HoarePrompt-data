Postcondition: **`numbers` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 2**.
