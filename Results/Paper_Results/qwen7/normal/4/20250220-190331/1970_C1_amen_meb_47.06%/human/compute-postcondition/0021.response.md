Postcondition: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2']], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `len(nums) != 2` is true or false, the variables `numbers`, `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial constraints, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
