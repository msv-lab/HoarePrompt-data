Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least one more time regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the variables inside the loop head to ensure the loop executes again.

State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2'], `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `num1` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[0])`, `num2` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[1])`**
