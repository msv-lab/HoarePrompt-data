Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `nums` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `num1` is the integer obtained from `int(nums[0])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of the first element in the list `nums` to the variable `num1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that the length of `nums` is not equal to 2 is checked, but since the code does not show any further actions based on this condition, we assume it passes this check.
