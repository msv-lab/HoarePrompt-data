Output State: `numbers` is a list containing pairs of integers read from the input until the loop condition is no longer met, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.

Explanation: The loop continues to append pairs of integers to the `numbers` list as long as the input consists of exactly two elements. Once the input does not meet this criterion (i.e., the input list has a length different from 2), the loop breaks. Therefore, the final state of `numbers` will be a list of all such pairs provided by the user, with no further additions once the loop terminates. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states, as they are not modified within the loop.
