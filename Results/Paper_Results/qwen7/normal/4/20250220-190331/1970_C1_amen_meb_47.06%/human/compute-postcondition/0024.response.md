Output State: **`numbers` is now ['num1', 'num2', ['num1', 'num2'], ['num1', 'num2']]; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `t` is 1; `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.append([num1, num2])` appends a new list containing the values of `num1` and `num2` to the existing list `numbers`. Since `num1` and `num2` are the integer values of the first and second elements in `nums` respectively, the updated `numbers` list includes the original elements and the newly appended list. All other variables remain unchanged.
