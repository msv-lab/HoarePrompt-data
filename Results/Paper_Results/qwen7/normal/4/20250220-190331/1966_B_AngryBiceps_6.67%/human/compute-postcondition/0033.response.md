Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each input string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each input string in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `a`. This means that the list `a` no longer contains any elements that were previously input by the user. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `first_row`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
