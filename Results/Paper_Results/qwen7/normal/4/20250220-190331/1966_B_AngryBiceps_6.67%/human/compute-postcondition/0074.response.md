Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n + 1`; `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user; `first_row` is updated by adding the first element of the second sublist in `a`; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element of the second sublist in `a` and then incrementing it by the last element of the last sublist in `a`.**

In more detail, the last element of the last sublist in `a` (which is `a[-1][-1]`) is added to `last_row`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
