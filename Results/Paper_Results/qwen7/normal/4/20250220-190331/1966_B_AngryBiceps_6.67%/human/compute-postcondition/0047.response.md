Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with three elements where the first element is an input from the user, the second element is another input from the user, and the third element is a new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the only element in the list `a` and the first element of the last element in the list `a` plus the first element of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in the list `a` plus the last element of the last element in the list `a` plus the first element of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increases the value of `last_row` by the last element of the last element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
