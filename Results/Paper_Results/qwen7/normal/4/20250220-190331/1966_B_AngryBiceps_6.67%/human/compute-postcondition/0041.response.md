Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the only element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends another input from the user to the list `a`. Initially, `a` had one element (an input from the user), and now it has two elements: the original input and a new input. The variables `i`, `n`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions and definitions.
