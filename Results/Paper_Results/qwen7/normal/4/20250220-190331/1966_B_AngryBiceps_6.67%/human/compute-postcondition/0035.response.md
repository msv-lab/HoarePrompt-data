Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string**.

The code assigns an empty string to `last_row`. Since `last_row` was initially an empty string, it remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
