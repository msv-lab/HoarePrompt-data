Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each element in the list `a` repeated according to their position in the list.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n`.
- The list `a` will contain `n` elements, each of which is an input provided by the user.
- The string `first_row` will consist of the first character from each element in `a`.
- The string `last_row` will consist of the last character from each element in `a`, with each character repeated as many times as it appears in the corresponding element of `a`.
