You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n × m filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if the first row is identical to the last row or if the first and last characters of each row are the same. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row in the list `a`.

2. **Extracting Rows and Columns:**
   - The first row (`first_row`) and the last row (`last_row`) are constructed by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.

3. **Checking Conditions for "NO":**
   - If the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) but different from the last row, the function prints "NO".
   - Similarly, if the first column (constructed from the first character of each row) is uniform but different from the last column (constructed from the last character of each row), the function prints "NO".

4. **Returning "YES" Otherwise:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "YES".

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Condition for "NO":**
   - The condition `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:` checks if the first row is uniform but different from the last row. This is not sufficient because it does not consider the possibility of making all cells the same color through operations involving internal cells.
   - Similarly, the condition `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:` checks if the first column is uniform but different from the last column. Again, this is not sufficient.

2. **Missing Consideration of Grid Operations:**
   - The problem allows operations that can change multiple cells at once. The current logic only checks the uniformity of the first and last rows/columns, which is too restrictive.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider the following grid:
```
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```

- The first row is "BWBW".
- The last row is "BWBW".
- The first column is "BWB".
- The last column is "BWB".

Both the first row and the last row are not uniform, and neither are the first and last columns. However, it is possible to make all cells white using the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 1) to color the first column white.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2) to color the second column white.
3. Select positions (1, 3) and (3, 3) to color the third column white.
4. Select positions (1, 4) and (3, 4) to color the fourth column white.

Thus, the current logic would incorrectly print "NO" for this grid.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it fails to account for the possibility of making all cells the same color through the allowed operations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
