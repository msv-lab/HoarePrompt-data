Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row in the list `a`.

2. **Extracting Rows and Columns:**
   - The first row (`first_row`) and the last row (`last_row`) are constructed by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.

3. **Checking Conditions for "NO":**
   - If the first row is uniform (all characters are the same) but different from the last row, the function prints "NO".
   - Similarly, if the first column (constructed from the first character of each row) is uniform but different from the last column (constructed from the last character of each row), the function prints "NO".

4. **Returning "YES" Otherwise:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints "YES".

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Condition for "NO":**
   - The condition `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:` checks if the first row is uniform but different from the last row. This is not sufficient because it does not consider the possibility of making all cells the same color through operations involving internal cells.
   - Similarly, the condition `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:` checks if the first column is uniform but different from the last column. Again, this is not sufficient.

2. **Missing Consideration of Grid Operations:**
   - The problem allows operations that can change multiple cells at once. The current logic only checks the uniformity of the first and last rows/columns, which is too restrictive.

### Example Counter-Case

Consider the following grid:
```
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```

- The first row is "BWBW".
- The last row is "BWBW".
- The first column is "BWB".
- The last column is "BWB".

Both the first row and the last row are not uniform, and neither are the first and last columns. However, it is possible to make all cells white using the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 1) to color the first column white.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2) to color the second column white.
3. Select positions (1, 3) and (3, 3) to color the third column white.
4. Select positions (1, 4) and (3, 4) to color the fourth column white.

Thus, the current logic would incorrectly print "NO" for this grid.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it fails to account for the possibility of making all cells the same color through the allowed operations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
