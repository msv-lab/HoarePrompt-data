Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with two elements where the first element is an input from the user and the second element is another input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the first element of the first element in list `a` and the first element of the second element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the second element in list `a` plus the last element of the last element in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2; `a` is a list with the first element being the last element's first character of the input list; `last_row` is updated by adding the last element's last character to its current value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
