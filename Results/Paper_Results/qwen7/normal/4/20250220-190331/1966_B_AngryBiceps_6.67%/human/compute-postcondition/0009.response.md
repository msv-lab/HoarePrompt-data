Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list with one element, which is an input from the user.
   - `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`**
