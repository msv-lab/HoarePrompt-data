Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the constraints, the input value should be between 1 and \(10^4\). Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is within this range.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input value will always be valid for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value itself, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected, given the constraints provided.
