Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `mid`, and `st` retain their original values. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is 0 and `high` is `mid`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `low` is `mid`, `high` is `mid` with `mid > 1`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1` with `mid < n-2`. `mid` is still defined as `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value `mid`.
