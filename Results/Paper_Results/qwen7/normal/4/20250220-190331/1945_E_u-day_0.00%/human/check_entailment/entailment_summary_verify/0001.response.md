### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3()` is not aimed at finding the correct position for `k` such that `p_l` becomes `k`. Instead, it performs a standard binary search to find the position of `k` in the array, which is not what is required.

2. **Insufficient Swapping**:
   - The program only performs one swap, which is insufficient as per the problem statement. The problem allows for up to two swaps, but the current implementation only handles one swap.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is not consistent with the problem requirements. The program should output the number of swaps and the pairs of indices for each swap, but it does not do so correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem. The original assessment accurately points out these flaws.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it fails to correctly implement the required logic and does not adhere to the specified output format.
