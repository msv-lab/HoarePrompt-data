Output State: **`low` is 0 and `high` is `mid` with `mid > 1`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1` with `mid < n-2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value `mid`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `st` now contains the value `mid`.
