The function takes three inputs: `n` (the length of the permutation), `k` (an integer between 1 and `n`), and `arr` (a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`). It performs a binary search on `arr` to find the position of `k`. If `k` is found, it prints `0`. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the indices `high` and `pos + 1`. The function returns nothing but prints the result based on the search outcome.
