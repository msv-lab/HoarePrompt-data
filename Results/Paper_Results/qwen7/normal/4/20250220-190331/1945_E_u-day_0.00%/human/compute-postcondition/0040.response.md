Output State: **`low` retains its original value, `high` retains its original value, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `st` retains its original value, and `st` now contains the value of `mid`.**

This means that the set `st` has been updated to include the value of `mid`, which is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
