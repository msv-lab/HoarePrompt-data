Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is `mid` with `mid > 1`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1` with `mid < n-2`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be the same as `mid`. The other variables (`high`, `mid`, and `st`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `low` while keeping the rest of the variables in their original conditions relative to each other.
