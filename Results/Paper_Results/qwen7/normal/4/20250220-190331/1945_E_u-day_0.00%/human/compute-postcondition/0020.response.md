Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step:

### Given Loop:
```python
while low + 1 < high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n-1`
- The final value of `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `pos` is either the index where `arr[i] == k` was found or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`
- `st` is an empty set

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `low = 0`
   - `high = n-1`

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true initially.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - With `low = 0` and `high = n-1`, the condition becomes `0 + 1 < n-1`, which simplifies to `1 < n-1`.
   - This inequality is always true for any positive integer `n > 2`.

Since `n` is specified as a positive integer, the condition `1 < n-1` will hold true for any `n > 2`. However, the problem specifies that `n` is a positive integer, meaning `n` could be as small as 1. 

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - If `n` is 1, then `low = 0` and `high = 0-1 = -1`, which would make the condition `0 + 1 < -1` false.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 2, the final value of `i` is `n-1`, `pos` is either the index where `arr[i] == k` was found or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set.**

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 2**
