Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `low` and `high` are consecutive integers such that `low + 1 == high`. This means `high = low + 1`.
   - `st` is a set containing all the unique midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
   - `mid` is the last midpoint calculated, which is `(low + high) // 2`. Given that `high = low + 1`, `mid` would be `(low + (low + 1)) // 2 = (2*low + 1) // 2`. Since `low` is an integer, `(2*low + 1) // 2` simplifies to `low` if `low` is even, or `low + 1` if `low` is odd.
   - `arr[mid]` is either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, depending on the binary search process.
   - `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(low + 1, pos + 1)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `pos`. From the context of binary search, `pos` likely refers to the position where `k` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. In a binary search, if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `k` would be placed to the left of `mid`, and if `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` would be placed to the right of `mid`.

Given the conditions:
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `pos` would be `mid + 1` because `k` would be placed to the left of `mid`.
- If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `pos` would be `mid` because `k` would be placed to the right of `mid`.

Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it implies that `k` is not at `low`, and thus `pos` must be `mid + 1` if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `low + 1` which is `high` since `low + 1 == high`.
- `pos + 1` which is `mid + 2` because `pos` is `mid + 1`.

Output: **high, mid + 2**
