Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `pos` is 1 (since it was set to 1 if `arr[i]` equals `k`)

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `pos` remains 1 because the condition for changing `pos` (i.e., `arr[i] == k`) has not been met yet (since `i` is now 2 and the previous value of `i` was 1).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `pos` remains 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `pos` is 1**
