You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: The final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `pos` is either the index where `arr[i] == k` was found or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The loop terminates when `low + 1 >= high`. At this point, `low` will be equal to `high - 1`, and `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations. The value of `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated before the loop condition was no longer satisfied. The values of `arr[mid]` will either be greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, depending on the position of `k` within the array `arr`.
    #
    #In more detail, the output state will be:
    #- `low` and `high` will be consecutive integers such that `low + 1 == high`.
    #- `st` will be a set containing all the unique midpoints calculated during the loop iterations.
    #- `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated, which is `(low + high) // 2`.
    #- `arr[mid]` will either be greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, depending on the binary search process.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high, mid + 2
    #State: `low` and `high` are consecutive integers such that `low + 1 == high`. `st` is a set containing all the unique midpoints calculated during the loop iterations. `mid` is the last midpoint calculated, which is `(low + high) // 2`. `arr[mid]` is either equal to `k` or either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, depending on the binary search process.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an integer based on the value of k and the elements in arr.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
