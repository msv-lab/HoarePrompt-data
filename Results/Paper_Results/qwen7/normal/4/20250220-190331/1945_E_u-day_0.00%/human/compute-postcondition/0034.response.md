Output State: **`low` is 0 and `high` is `mid`, or `low` is `mid` and `high` is `n-1`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value `mid`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. This does not affect the values of `low`, `st`, or the expression for `mid`. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as stated above.
