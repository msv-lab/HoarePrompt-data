Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - If `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is 0.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 1.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - The value of `pos` does not change unless `arr[i]` equals `k`, but since we are not given any information about the value of `arr[1]` or `k`, we assume `pos` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `pos` is 0**.
