Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n-1`, the final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `pos` is either the index where `arr[i] == k` was found or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `n-1` respectively. The values of `i`, `n`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial state.
