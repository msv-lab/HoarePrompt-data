You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints the ceiling of \( k/2 \). Otherwise, it prints \( k/2 + 1 \). After processing all test cases, it ensures that the number of remaining test cases \( t \) is reduced to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks three main conditions:
     1. If \( k = 1 \), it prints `1`.
     2. If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
     3. Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

3. **Checking Each Condition:**
   - **Condition 1:** If \( k = 1 \):
     - This condition is straightforward and correct. Coloring one cell will always satisfy the requirement of having at least one colored cell in one diagonal.
   - **Condition 2:** If \( k \leq 2n \):
     - For this case, the solution uses \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). 
     - Let's verify why this works:
       - In an \( n \times n \) grid, we can color cells in such a way that every other diagonal gets at least one colored cell. 
       - For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), we can color cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (1,3) to cover 4 diagonals.
       - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) ensures that we are covering as many diagonals as needed without over-coloring.
   - **Condition 3:** If \( k > 2n \):
     - The solution uses \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
     - This condition is more complex. We need to ensure that the additional cells are correctly counted.
     - For \( k > 2n \), we need to ensure that we are covering all required diagonals. The formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) seems to account for the extra cells needed beyond \( 2n \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases like \( k = 1 \) and \( k \leq 2n \) correctly.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the solution might not be optimal but still provides a valid answer.

### Conclusion:
The given solution appears to handle the problem correctly for the given constraints and examples. It covers the base cases and provides a reasonable approach for larger values of \( k \).
