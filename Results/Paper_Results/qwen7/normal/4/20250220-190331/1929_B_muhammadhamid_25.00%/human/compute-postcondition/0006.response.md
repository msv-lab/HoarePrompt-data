Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, and `k` is 1. The overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition since the else part is absent and the if condition does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`; it only confirms that `k` is 1.
