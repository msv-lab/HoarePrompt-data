Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is now the first integer input, and `k` is the second integer input, which is also an integer and is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 2 times `n`.
