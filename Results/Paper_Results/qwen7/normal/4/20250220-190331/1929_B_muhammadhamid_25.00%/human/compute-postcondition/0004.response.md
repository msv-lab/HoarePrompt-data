Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, and `k` is 1. We continue the loop or iteration we were inside.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, their values remain the same. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of these variables but indicates that the loop or iteration continues.
