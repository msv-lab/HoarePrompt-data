Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    if k <= 2 * n:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    else:
        print(k // 2 + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, and `k` is 1, with `k` being less than or equal to 2 times `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the first input and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, and after the execution of the if else block, `t` remains within the range 1 to 1000, and the program continues with the next iteration or statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer and is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, and after executing the if statement, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and the loop continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
