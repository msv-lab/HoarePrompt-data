Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is decreased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and `k` is still decreased by 1.
