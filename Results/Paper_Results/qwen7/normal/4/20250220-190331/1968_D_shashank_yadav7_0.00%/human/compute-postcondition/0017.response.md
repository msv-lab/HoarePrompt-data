Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` by subtracting 1 from the value of `p[b]`. However, since the initial value of `p[b]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `b`. Therefore, the updated state includes `b` being `p[b] - 1`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
