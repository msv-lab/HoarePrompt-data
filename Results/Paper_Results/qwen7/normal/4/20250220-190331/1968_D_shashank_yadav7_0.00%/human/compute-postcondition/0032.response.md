Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1` - 1, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`**

Explanation: The line `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Since `b` is defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, the value of `bp` is updated to `a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
