Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `-n + 1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n + 1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `b` respectively. The values of `i`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation. The values of `k` and `b` are updated to the input values, and `n` is also updated to the input value. The values of `s` and `i` are not directly dependent on the input but are defined in terms of `p` which remains unchanged.
