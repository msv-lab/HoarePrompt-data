### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`) are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are initially set to the product of `a[b]` and `k` for Bodya and `a[s]` and `k` for Sasha.

4. **Game Loop:**
   - The program enters a loop that simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - In each turn, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their new positions according to the permutation `p`.
   - The scores are updated based on the current positions and the remaining turns.
   - The maximum possible scores are recalculated using the maximum function to ensure the best possible score for each player.

5. **Final Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the final scores are compared.
   - The program prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly initializes the starting positions and scores.
- The loop simulates the game for `k` turns, updating positions and scores appropriately.
- The use of `max` ensures that the program considers the best possible outcome for each player at each turn.
- The final comparison and output are handled correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the logic correctly as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
