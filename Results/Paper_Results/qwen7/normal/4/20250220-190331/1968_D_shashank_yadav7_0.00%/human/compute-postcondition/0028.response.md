Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1` - 1, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by first evaluating `p[s]` and then subtracting 1 from it. Since the initial state of `s` is `p[s] - 1`, substituting this into the updated equation gives us `s` as `(p[s] - 1) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
