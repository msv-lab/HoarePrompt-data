Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
3. The starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` are adjusted to be zero-indexed.
4. The program initializes `bm` (Bodya's maximum possible score) and `sm` (Sasha's maximum possible score) with the initial scores at the starting positions.
5. It then iterates through up to `k` turns, updating the positions `b` and `s` according to the permutation `p` and recalculating the scores `bm` and `sm` at each step.
6. The final scores `bm` and `sm` are compared, and the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is printed.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program seems to correctly implement the rules of the game and calculate the scores accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions based on the provided code and the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
