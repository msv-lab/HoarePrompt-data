Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `-n + 1`, `b` is `p[p[...]] - n + 1` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `b`), `s` is `p[p[...] - (n-1)] - (n-1)` (where `p` is applied `n-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `n-1`), `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` over all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and splits them into a list, assigning this list to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
