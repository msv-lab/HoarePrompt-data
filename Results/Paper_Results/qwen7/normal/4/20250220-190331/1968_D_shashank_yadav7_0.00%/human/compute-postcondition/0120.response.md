Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is decreased by 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `sp` is the element at index `s` from list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `sp = a[s]` assigns the value of the element at index `s` from list `a` to the variable `sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
