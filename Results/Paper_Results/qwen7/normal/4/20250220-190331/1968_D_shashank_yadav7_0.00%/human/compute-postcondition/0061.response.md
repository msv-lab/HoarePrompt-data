Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `-n + 1`, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`, `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all iterations, `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` over all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `sp = a[s]` assigns the value of `a[s]` to `sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
