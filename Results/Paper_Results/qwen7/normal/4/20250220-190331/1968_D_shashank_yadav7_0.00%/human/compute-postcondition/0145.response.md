Output State: **`bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[p[b] - 1]`, `sm` is increased by `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `sp` was previously `a[s] + sp`, after this operation, `sp` becomes `a[s] + sp + a[s]`. The other variables (`bm`, `b`, `i`, `k`, `s`, `sm`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them.
