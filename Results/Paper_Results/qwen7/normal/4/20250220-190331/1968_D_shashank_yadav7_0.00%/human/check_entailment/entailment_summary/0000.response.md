Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters: \( n \), \( k \), \( b \), and \( s \).
3. It then reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).
4. The program adjusts the starting positions \( b \) and \( s \) to be zero-indexed.
5. It initializes `bm` and `sm` with the initial scores of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
6. In the loop, it simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores accordingly.
7. The logic for updating scores and positions seems to be correct, considering the rules of the game.
8. The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` determines the winner, which is correctly printed.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
