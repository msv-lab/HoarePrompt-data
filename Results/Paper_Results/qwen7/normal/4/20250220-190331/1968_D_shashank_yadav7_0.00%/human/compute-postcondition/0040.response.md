Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is increased by `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**.

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to it. Since the exact values of `a[s]`, `a[b]`, `bp`, and `sp` are not given, we keep them in their expressions. The other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
