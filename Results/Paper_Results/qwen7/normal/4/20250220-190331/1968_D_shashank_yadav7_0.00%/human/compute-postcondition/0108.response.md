Based on the initial state provided, the variables `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bm`, and `sm` have specific values and relationships. However, the print statement itself does not depend on these variables but instead directly prints a string.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

The output will be the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
