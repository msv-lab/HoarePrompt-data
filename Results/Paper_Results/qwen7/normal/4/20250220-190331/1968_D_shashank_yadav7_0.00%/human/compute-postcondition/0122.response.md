Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is decreased by 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `sp` is the element at index `s` from list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` from list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`**.

This means that the variable `bm` is now assigned the value of `a[b] * k`. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described in the initial state.
