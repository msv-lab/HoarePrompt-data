Output State: **`b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, and `s` is `p[s] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to `p[s] - 1`. Since the initial value of `s` is not explicitly given, it remains as `p[s] - 1`. All other variables (`b`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
