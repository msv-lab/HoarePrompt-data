Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the necessary parameters and arrays.

2. **Index Adjustment**: The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from their values.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation**: The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are calculated using the starting positions and the corresponding values in the array `a`.

4. **Game Loop**: The program simulates the game for `k` turns. In each turn, it updates the positions of both players according to the permutation `p` and calculates the maximum possible scores for both players considering their potential moves.

5. **Final Comparison**: After simulating the game, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

The logic for updating scores and positions is correct and follows the rules specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
