Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`
   - `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `k` is `-1`
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`
   - `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`
   - `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`
   - `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`
   - `sm` is increased by `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n - 2` and the loop iterates over `range(n)`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `(n - 2) + 1 = n - 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

So, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `-1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, `sm` is increased by `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]**
