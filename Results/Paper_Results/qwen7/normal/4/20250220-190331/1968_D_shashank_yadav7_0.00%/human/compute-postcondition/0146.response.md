Output State: **`bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, `sm` is increased by `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. The value of `b` is already defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, so `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
