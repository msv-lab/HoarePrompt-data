Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - According to the given state, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - For the loop `for i in range(n)` to execute, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(n)`. Since `range(n)` includes values from `0` to `n-1`, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Given that `i` is initially `n + 1`, it is currently out of the range `0` to `n-1`. To allow the loop to execute, `i` must be adjusted to be within this range. This means `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

4. **Adjust `n` if necessary**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1 for `i` to be within the valid range. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified in the problem, but we know that `n` must be a non-negative integer.

Given these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
