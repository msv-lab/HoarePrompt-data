Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `b` is unchanged, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code updates `bm` by adding the maximum of two values: `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`. The first part of the expression for `bm` is already given as `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, so we just add the new term `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` to it. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
