Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `k` is unchanged, `b` is `b-1`, `s` is a single integer obtained from the input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `sp` is the element at index `s` of list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` of list `a`, `bm` is the product of `a[b]` and `k`.**

Explanation: The code `bm = a[b] * k` assigns the value of `a[b]` multiplied by `k` to the variable `bm`. The values of `t`, `i`, `p`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
