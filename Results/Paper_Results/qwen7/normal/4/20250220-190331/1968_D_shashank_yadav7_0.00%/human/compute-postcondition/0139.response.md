Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of `bm`, `b`, `i`, `k`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states. We also note that the loop or if statement has been broken out of.
