Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer, and the current value of `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. In this case, since there is no loop or switch statement provided, the only effect is that the program exits the implied context (likely a loop or conditional block). The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
