Output State: **`bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1 - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-2`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or the else part is executed.**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` by subtracting 1 from `p[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The precondition that either the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or the else part is executed (which does not change the variables) remains valid.
