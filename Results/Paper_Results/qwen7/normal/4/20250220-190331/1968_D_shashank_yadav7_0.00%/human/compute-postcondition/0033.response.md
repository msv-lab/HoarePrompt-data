Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check if the loop condition is met**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1` - 1, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`**
