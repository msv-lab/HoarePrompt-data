### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1()` generates a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \) and reverses every other element.
   - This means the list will look like: \([1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots]\) if \( n \) is even, or \([1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots, n/2+1]\) if \( n \) is odd.

3. **Checking the Validity**:
   - Let's verify the provided solution with a few examples:
     - For \( n = 3 \): The permutation is \([1, 3, 2]\). Checking pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 3 \) and \( p_2 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
     - For \( n = 4 \): The permutation is \([4, 1, 2, 3]\). Checking pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \) and \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
       - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_1 = 4 \).

4. **General Case Analysis**:
   - While the provided solution works for small values of \( n \), it needs to be generalized to ensure it holds for all \( n \geq 3 \).
   - Consider \( n = 6 \):
     - The permutation is \([6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]\).
     - Checking pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 6 \) divides \( p_3 = 5 \) (since 6 does not divide 5, this is fine).
       - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 2 \) and \( p_4 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_6 = 3 \).
       - However, \( p_5 = 4 \) divides \( p_6 = 3 \) (since 4 does not divide 3, this is fine).

5. **Counterexample**:
   - For \( n = 6 \), the permutation \([6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]\) does not satisfy the condition because \( p_5 = 4 \) divides \( p_6 = 3 \).

Given the counterexample, the provided solution does not always generate a valid permutation for all \( n \geq 3 \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the provided solution fails to meet the problem's requirements for certain values of \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
