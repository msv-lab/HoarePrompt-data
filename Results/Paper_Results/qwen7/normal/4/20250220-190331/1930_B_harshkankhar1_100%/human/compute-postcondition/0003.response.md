Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). It also ensures that the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.**

Note: The exact operations to be performed on t and n are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the constraints and the fact that the function processes these test cases.
