### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1()` generates a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \) and reverses every other element.
   - This means the list will look like: \([1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots]\) if \( n \) is even, or \([1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots, n/2+1]\) if \( n \) is odd.

3. **Checking the Validity**:
   - The original assessment claims that the generated permutation meets the condition because the elements alternate between high and low values, making it impossible for \( p_i \) to divide \( p_{i+1} \).
   - However, this reasoning is flawed. While the alternating pattern ensures that no two consecutive elements are both high or both low, it does not guarantee that no two elements in the entire permutation satisfy the divisibility condition.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( n = 6 \):
     - The generated permutation is \([1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]\).
     - Check pairs:
       - \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 6 \).
       - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 5 \).
       - \( p_5 = 3 \) does not divide \( p_6 = 4 \).
     - Although \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 6 \), this violates the condition.

5. **General Case Analysis**:
   - The alternating pattern does not prevent all possible pairs from satisfying the divisibility condition. For example, in the permutation \([1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4]\), \( p_1 = 1 \) divides \( p_2 = 6 \), which is a violation.

Given the counterexample and the general case analysis, the provided solution does not always generate a valid permutation according to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
