Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive), and every second element in `a` is reversed.

Let's break down the list `a`:
- The list `a` starts as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... , t-1, t]`.
- Every second element is reversed, meaning the elements at even indices are swapped with their corresponding elements from the end of the list.

For example, if `t = 5`:
- Original list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- After reversing every second element: `[1, 5, 3, 4, 2]`

In general, the list `a` will look like this after the reversal:
- `a[0] = 1`
- `a[1] = t`
- `a[2] = 3`
- `a[3] = t-1`
- `a[4] = 5`
- `a[5] = t-2`
- And so on...

The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 5 3 4 2 ... (where the sequence continues with the pattern described above)**
