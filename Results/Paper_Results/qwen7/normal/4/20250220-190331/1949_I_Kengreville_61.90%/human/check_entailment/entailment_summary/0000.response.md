Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the provided functions correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to check if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that:
   - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
   - No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.
   - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Function `dfs` Analysis**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to perform a depth-first search starting from a disk `i`.
   - It marks the disk as visited and recursively visits all connected disks that are tangent to the current disk.
   - For each connected disk `j`, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values based on the tangency condition.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` initializes necessary variables and reads the input.
   - It iterates through each disk and performs a DFS if the disk hasn't been visited.
   - After performing DFS for each disk, it checks if any unvisited disk has a non-zero sum of specific coefficients (`c1`).
   - If any such disk is found, it prints 'YES' indicating that it's possible to adjust the radii as required.
   - If no such disk is found, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `dfs` correctly identifies which disks are tangent to each other and updates the coefficients accordingly.
   - The main loop in `func_1` ensures that all disks are checked, and the condition for printing 'YES' is correctly implemented.

Given the execution summaries and the problem requirements, the provided functions seem to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. They handle the tangency conditions and ensure that the sum of radii can be decreased while maintaining the tangency constraints.

Correctness: **True**
