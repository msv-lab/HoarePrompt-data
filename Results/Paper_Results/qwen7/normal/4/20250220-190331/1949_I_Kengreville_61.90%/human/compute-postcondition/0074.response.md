Output State: **`c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`, where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.**

This means that the value of `c0` has been updated by adding `coef0[j]` to its current value, where `j` is the next element in the list `nodes`. The other preconditions remain unchanged: `nodes` must contain at least one element.
