Output State: All elements in `nodes` have been iterated over; `c0` is increased by the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `c0` will hold the total sum of all `coef0[j]` values for every `j` present in `nodes`, and `c1` will hold the total sum of all `coef1[j]` values for every `j` present in `nodes`. The `nodes` list remains unchanged from its final state after the last iteration, and the other variables (`i`, `ok`, `coef0[i]`, `coef1[i]`, and `visited[i]`) remain in their post-loop conditions as per the initial and intermediate states provided.
