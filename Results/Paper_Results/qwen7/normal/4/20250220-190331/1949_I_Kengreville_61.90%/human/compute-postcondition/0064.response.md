Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `nodes` contains `i`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False, and the DFS function has been called with `i` as the argument.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function is called with `i` as the argument. This function typically performs a depth-first search starting from node `i`. Since the exact implementation of `dfs` is not provided, we assume it adds `i` to the `nodes` list and possibly updates other variables like `visited[i]` to `True`. However, without the exact implementation, we can only state that `i` is added to `nodes`, and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
