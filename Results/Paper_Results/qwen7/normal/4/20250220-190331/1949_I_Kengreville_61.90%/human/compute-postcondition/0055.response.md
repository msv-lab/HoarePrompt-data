Output State: The `nodes` list remains empty, `c0` remains 0, and `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` three times.

In natural language: The `nodes` list does not change and stays empty. The variable `c0` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `c1` is incremented by the value of `coef1[j]` three times, so `c1` will be equal to `3 * coef1[j]`.
