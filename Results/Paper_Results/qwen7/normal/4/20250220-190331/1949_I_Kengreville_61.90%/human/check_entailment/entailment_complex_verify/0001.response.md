### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to adjust the radii of disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.
   - The solution uses a graph representation where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each node. These coefficients help in determining how much the radius of each disk should be adjusted.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` are initialized for each node during the DFS traversal. For a node `i`, `coef0[i]` represents the sum of the original radii of the disks that are connected to `i` through tangency, and `coef1[i]` is set to 1 initially.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - After the DFS traversal, for each connected component, the code checks if the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero. If it is zero, it means there's no way to decrease the sum of radii for that component without violating the tangency condition.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly initializes the necessary arrays and starts the DFS traversal for each unvisited node.
   - The `dfs` function correctly updates the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - The logic to check if the sum of radii can be decreased is implemented correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles cases where disks are tangent and ensures no overlap after adjusting the radii.
   - It correctly identifies components where the sum of radii can be decreased.

6. **Detailed Analysis of the Code**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The `func_1` function initializes the necessary arrays and reads the input.
   - **DFS Traversal**:
     - The `dfs` function marks nodes as visited and updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for each connected node.
   - **Checking Sum of Radii**:
     - After the DFS traversal, the code checks if the sum of `coef1` values for each connected component is non-zero. If it is zero, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

7. **Example Analysis**:
   - **First Example**:
     - The given example shows that it is possible to decrease the radii of the first and third disks by 0.5, and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5, while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total sum of radii.
   - **Second Example**:
     - The given example shows that it is not possible to decrease the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total sum of radii.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if the radii can be adjusted as required. It correctly handles the tangency condition and ensures no overlap after adjusting the radii.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and ensuring no overlap.
