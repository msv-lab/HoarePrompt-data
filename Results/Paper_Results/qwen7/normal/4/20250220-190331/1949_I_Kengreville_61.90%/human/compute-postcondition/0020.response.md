Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `j` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The code `dx = x[i] - x[j]` does not affect the values of `j`, `visited[j]`, `coef0[j]`, or `coef1[j]`. It only updates the value of `dx` to be `x[i] - x[j]`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so it is now `j + 1`. All other variables retain their previous states.
