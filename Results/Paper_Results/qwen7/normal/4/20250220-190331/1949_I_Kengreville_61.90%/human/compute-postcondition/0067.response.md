Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in nodes`. The variables involved here are `j` and `nodes`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is a positive integer + 1.
   - `nodes` contains `i`.
   - `c0` is 0.
   - `c1` is 0.
   - `coef0[i]` is 0.
   - `coef1[i]` is 1.
   - `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `nodes`. For the loop to start, `nodes` must contain at least one element (which is `i`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `nodes` must contain at least one element (`i`), we need to ensure that `nodes` is not empty.
   - The value of `j` will be set to each element in `nodes` during the loop iterations, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it will be assigned within the loop.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `nodes` is not empty.
   - The values of `c0`, `c1`, `coef0[i]`, `coef1[i]`, and `ok` are not directly related to the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`nodes` must contain at least one element (i.e., nodes is not empty)**.
