Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `coef1[i]`. Since `i` is a positive integer + 1, the value of `coef1[i]` becomes `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
