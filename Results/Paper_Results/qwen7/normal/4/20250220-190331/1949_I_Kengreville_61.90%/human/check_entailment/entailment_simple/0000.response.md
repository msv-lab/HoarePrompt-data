Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input as specified.
2. It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the graph formed by the tangency relationships between the disks.
3. During the DFS traversal, it calculates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for each disk, which represent linear constraints derived from the tangency conditions.
4. After completing the DFS for all disks, it checks if there exists any disk that remains unvisited and if the sum of `coef1` values for such disks is non-zero. If so, it concludes that it's possible to adjust the radii as required.
5. The logic for adjusting the radii ensures that the tangency conditions are preserved and that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.
6. The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
