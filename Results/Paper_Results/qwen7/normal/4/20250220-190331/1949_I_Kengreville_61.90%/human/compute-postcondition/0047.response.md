Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `nodes` is an empty list and must have at least one element, but since no elements are added or removed from `nodes`, its state remains unchanged. The code `c0 += coef0[j]` increases the value of `c0` by the value of `coef0[j]`. Since `j` is not defined in the context provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `c0`, but we know it has been increased by `coef0[j]`.
