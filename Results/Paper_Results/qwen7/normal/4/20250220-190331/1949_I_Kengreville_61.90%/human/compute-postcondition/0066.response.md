Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `nodes` contains `i`, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1, `ok` is True if `visited[i]` is False.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `c1` to 0. This updates the value of `c1` from its previous state (which was 0) to 0 again, meaning it remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
