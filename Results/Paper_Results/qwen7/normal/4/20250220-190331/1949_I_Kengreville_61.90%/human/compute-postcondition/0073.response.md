Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop iterates over the elements in the list `nodes`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nodes` must contain at least one element.
   - `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been the last element processed from `nodes`.
   - Since `nodes` must contain at least one element, there must be at least one remaining element in `nodes` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `nodes` must still contain at least one element.
   - `c1` will be increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`. Since `j` was the last element processed, the next element in `nodes` will be the new value of `j`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `nodes` must contain at least one element.
   - `c1` will be increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`nodes` must contain at least one element, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the next element in `nodes`**.
