Output State: **`j` is 0; `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`; `visited[j]` is true; `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`; `coef1[j] is `-coef1[i]`.**

Explanation: The `dfs(j)` function is called with `j` as the argument. This function typically marks the node `j` as visited (changing `visited[j]` from `False` to `True`) and may perform other operations depending on its implementation. However, without the actual implementation details of `dfs`, we can only assume that `visited[j]` is set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values as given in the initial state.
