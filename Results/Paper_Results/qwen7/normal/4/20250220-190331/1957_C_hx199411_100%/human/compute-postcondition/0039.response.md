Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(3, m + 1)`. This means `i` will start from 3 and go up to `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The problem states that `i` is the final value of `k`. Since the loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m`, `i` must be initialized to `3` for the loop to start executing.

3. **Determine the state of `m`**: The loop will continue until `i` reaches `m + 1`. Therefore, `m` must be a positive integer (since `m` is not `0`).

4. **Other variables**: The variables `dp`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num` are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop starts. However, they might be used within the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute, we do not need to change these variables.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `i` should be `3` (the starting point of the loop).
- `m` must be a positive integer (since the loop will run until `i` reaches `m + 1`).

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be a positive integer**
