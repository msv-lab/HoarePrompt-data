Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is `0`, `dp[1]` is `1`, `dp[2]` is `3`, `i` is the final value of `k`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `c` and `r` are the inputs from the last iteration, `num` is `2 * k` if `c` was equal to `r` in all iterations, or `k` if `c` was not equal to `r` in any of the iterations, and `m` is not `0`.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` updates the second element of the list `dp` to `3`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
