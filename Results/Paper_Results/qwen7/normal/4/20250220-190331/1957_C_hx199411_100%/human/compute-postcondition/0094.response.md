Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is the total sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is `m + 1`, and `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with 0s, with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` if `m >= 7`, otherwise `m` is 1.**
