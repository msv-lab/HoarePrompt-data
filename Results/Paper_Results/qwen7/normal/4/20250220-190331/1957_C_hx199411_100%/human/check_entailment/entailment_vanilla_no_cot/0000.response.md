Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the number of possible configurations after the initial `k` moves. The logic in the `num` variable calculation is flawed. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of "independent" positions (positions that are not mirrored) is incorrect.

Here's a more detailed explanation and the correct approach:

1. **Initial Setup**: We need to track the positions of the rooks placed so far. For each rook placed, we need to ensure that no two rooks share the same row or column.

2. **Mirroring Effect**: When a rook is placed at `(r, c)`, the computer places a rook at `(c, r)`. This means that the positions are mirrored unless `r == c`.

3. **Counting Independent Positions**: We need to count the number of independent positions left after the initial `k` moves. An independent position is one that is not mirrored.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for the remaining independent positions.

### Correct Solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    def count_configurations(n, num_independent):
        if num_independent == 0:
            return 1
        dp = [0] * (num_independent + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, num_independent + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % MOD
        return dp[num_independent]

    while t:
        t -= 1
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        num_independent = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            r, c = map(int, input().split())
            if r != c:
                num_independent += 2
            else:
                num_independent += 1
        m = n - num_independent
        if m <= 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(count_configurations(n, m))

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the number of independent positions and uses dynamic programming to find the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions.
