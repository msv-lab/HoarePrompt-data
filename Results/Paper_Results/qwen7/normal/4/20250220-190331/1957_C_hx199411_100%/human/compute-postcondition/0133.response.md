Output State: **`t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is -1, `m` is `n - num`, and `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, and the third element dp[2] is 3.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` changes the value of `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
