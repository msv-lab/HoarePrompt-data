Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0, `c` and `r` are the last input integers provided during the loop's final iteration, and `num` will be the sum of 2 for each time the condition `c != r` was met plus 1 for each time the condition `c == r` was met.

This means that `num` will be calculated as follows: For every iteration where `c` is not equal to `r`, `num` increases by 2, and for every iteration where `c` is equal to `r`, `num` increases by 1. The final value of `i` will reflect the total number of iterations completed, which is equal to `k`.
