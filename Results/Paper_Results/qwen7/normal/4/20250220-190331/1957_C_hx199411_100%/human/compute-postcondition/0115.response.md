Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer input split into an integer, `r` is the second integer input split into an integer, `num` is either `num + 1` or `num + 2`, and `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `c` and `r`. The values of `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
