Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 10^4 exclusive; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space.**

In this scenario, the initial state of `t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 10^4 exclusive. The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `t` remain unchanged.
