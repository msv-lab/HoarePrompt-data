Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 10^4 exclusive; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `num` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `num` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `num` to 0.
