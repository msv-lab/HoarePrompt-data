Postcondition: `i` is the final value of `k`, `k` remains the same as its initial value, `c` and `r` are the inputs from the last iteration, `num` is `2 * k` if `c` was not equal to `r` in any of the iterations, or `k` if `c` was equal to `r` in all iterations, and `m` is `0` if the condition `m == 0` is true, otherwise `m` is either `1` or a positive integer, `dp[3]` is `8`, `dp[4]` is `14`, `dp[5]` is `20`, `dp[6]` is `30`.
