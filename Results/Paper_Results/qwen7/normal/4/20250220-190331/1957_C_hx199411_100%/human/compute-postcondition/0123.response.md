Postcondition: `t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given, `i` is `-1` since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration and starts from -1 when `k` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, and the current value of `m` is 0.
