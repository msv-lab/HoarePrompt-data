Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `num` is not present in the initial state, but the code increments `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` changes from 1 to 2. The values of `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
