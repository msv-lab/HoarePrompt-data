Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `r` is an input integer.
   - `num` is increased by either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` equals `r`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `r` is an input integer.
   - `num` is increased by either 1 or 2 based on the condition `c == r`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `k` stays the same.
   - The values of `c` and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
   - `num` will be increased by either 1 or 2 based on the condition `c == r`. Since this is the start of the next iteration, we don't know the exact value of `num` yet, but we know it will be updated accordingly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged values of `k`, `c`, `r`, and `num`.

**State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is increased by either 1 or 2 (based on the condition `c == r`), and `i` is `i + 1`**.
