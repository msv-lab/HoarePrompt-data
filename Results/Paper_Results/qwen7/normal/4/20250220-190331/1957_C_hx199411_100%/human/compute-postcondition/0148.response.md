Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers t, n, and k, and pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) representing moves. It verifies that the conditions 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and that no two rooks share the same row or column after each move are met. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**
