Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` will be the same as its initial value, `c` and `r` will be the last input integers provided during the loop's execution, and `num` will be the initial value of `num` (which is 0) plus `k` multiplied by 2 if `c` did not equal `r` for any iteration, or `k` if `c` equaled `r` for every iteration.

In simpler terms, `i` will be the final value of `k`, `k` remains unchanged, `c` and `r` will be the inputs from the last iteration, and `num` will be `2 * k` if `c` was not equal to `r` in any of the iterations, or `k` if `c` was equal to `r` in all iterations.
