Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `l` must be less than `r - 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 4, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `0` since `t = k % 2` and `k % 2` results in 0 if `k` is even.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the else part is not provided, we assume that the condition `mi - t - k // 2 == 0` is true, leading to the specified postcondition where `ans` is set to 4.
