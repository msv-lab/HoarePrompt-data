You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes the number of ships (n), a threshold value (k), and a list of ships' durabilities (a). It then iteratively reduces the durabilities of the ships from both ends towards the center until the threshold value (k) is exhausted or all ships' durabilities become zero. For each ship whose durability becomes zero, it increments a counter (ans). Finally, it prints the total count of ships whose durabilities became zero.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the logic for reducing the durability of the ships and determining when they sink is flawed. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Initial Durabilities:** The initial durabilities of the ships are `[1, 2, 4, 3]`.
2. **First Attack:** The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to `0`. Now, the durabilities are `[0, 2, 4, 3]`.
3. **Second Attack:** The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to `2`. Now, the durabilities are `[0, 2, 4, 2]`.
4. **Third Attack:** The Kraken attacks the first ship again, but since it already sank, this attack has no effect. The durabilities remain `[0, 2, 4, 2]`.
5. **Fourth Attack:** The Kraken attacks the last ship again, reducing its durability to `1`. Now, the durabilities are `[0, 2, 4, 1]`.
6. **Fifth Attack:** The Kraken attacks the first ship again, but since it already sank, this attack has no effect. The durabilities remain `[0, 2, 4, 1]`.

In this scenario, the first and last ships should both sink, resulting in 2 ships being sunk. However, the program incorrectly outputs `0`, indicating that neither ship was sunk. This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks according to the problem description.
