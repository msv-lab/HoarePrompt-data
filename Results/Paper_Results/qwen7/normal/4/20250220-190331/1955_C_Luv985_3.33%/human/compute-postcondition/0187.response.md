Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` must be at least 2; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2 > k`; `t` is `k % 2`; `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0**
