Output State: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is a string from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `T` is also unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. Therefore, `T` is still a positive integer less than its original value by 1, `n` is now an integer derived from the input string, and `k` remains as a string from the input.
