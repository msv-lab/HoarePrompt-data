Output State: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is a string from the input, `k` is a string from the input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state of `T` is a positive integer less than its original value by 1, `T` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the first and second parts of the input string, respectively.
