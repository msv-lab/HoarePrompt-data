Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k - 2 * mi` or remains as is), `l` is either `l + 1` or unchanged, `r` is either `r - 2` or `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is either 4 or 5 depending on the condition, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is 0 if `k` is even, otherwise `t` retains its original value.**
