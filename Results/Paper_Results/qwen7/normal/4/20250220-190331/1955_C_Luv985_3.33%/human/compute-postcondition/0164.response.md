Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
