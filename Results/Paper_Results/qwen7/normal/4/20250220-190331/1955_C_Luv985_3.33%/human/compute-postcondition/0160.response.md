Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (greater than 1)**

Explanation: The initial state of `T` is a positive integer (greater than 0). After executing `T -= 1`, `T` is decremented by 1. Since `T` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `T` will now be a positive integer greater than 1. Variables that were not affected by the code remain in their initial state.
