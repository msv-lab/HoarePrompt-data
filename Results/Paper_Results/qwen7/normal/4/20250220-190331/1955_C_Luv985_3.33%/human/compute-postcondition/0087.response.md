Output State: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**.

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
