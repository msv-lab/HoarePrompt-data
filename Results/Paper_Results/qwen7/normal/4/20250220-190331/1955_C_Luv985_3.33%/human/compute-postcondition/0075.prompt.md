Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda function, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `mi * 2` (either `k - mi * 2` or remains `k`), `a` is a list of integers, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 3, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k - 2 * mi` or remains as is), `l` is either `l + 1` or unchanged, `r` is either `r - 2` or `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is either 4 or 5 depending on the condition, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is 0 if `k` is even, otherwise `t` retains its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
