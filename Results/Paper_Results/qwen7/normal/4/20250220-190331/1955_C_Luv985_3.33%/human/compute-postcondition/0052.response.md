Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is 3, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `a[r]` is 0, then `T` decreases by `1 + 2 * mi`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` decreases by `2 * mi`, `l` increases by 1, `r` decreases by 1, `a[r]` is further decreased by `mi`, `ans` becomes 3, and `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. Since there is no else part, these changes apply unconditionally when `a[r]` equals 0.
