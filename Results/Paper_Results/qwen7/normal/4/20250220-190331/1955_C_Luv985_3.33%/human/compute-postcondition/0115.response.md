Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted according to the if condition, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is 2 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.**
