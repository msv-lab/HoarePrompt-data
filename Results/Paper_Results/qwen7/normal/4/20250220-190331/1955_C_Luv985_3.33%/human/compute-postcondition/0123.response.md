Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer less than the original value of `T` by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list `a`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `ans` is increased by 1, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.
