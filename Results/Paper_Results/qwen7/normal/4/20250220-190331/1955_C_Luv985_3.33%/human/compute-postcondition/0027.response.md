Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
