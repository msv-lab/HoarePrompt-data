Output State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 0 and has been decreased by 1, `_` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer and currently equals 2, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum between `x` and the current value of `ax`. Given that `ax` was initially 1000000007, if `x` is less than 1000000007, `ax` will now be equal to `x`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 1000000007, `ax` remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
