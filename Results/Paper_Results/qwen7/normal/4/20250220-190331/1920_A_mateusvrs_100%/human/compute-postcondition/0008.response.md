Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` are kept as per the initial state, while `a` and `x` are updated with the integers from the input.
