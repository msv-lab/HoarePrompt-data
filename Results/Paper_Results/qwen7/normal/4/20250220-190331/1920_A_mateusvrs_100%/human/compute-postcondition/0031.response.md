Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007 (or 1000000007 if `x` is greater than 1000007), `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum between `x` and the current value of `bx`. Since `bx` was initially `-1`, `bx` will now be updated to the value of `x` if `x` is greater than `-1`, or it will remain `-1` if `x` is less than or equal to `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
