Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be at least 1, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), and `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (-1 if no valid `x` is provided).**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still reflect the fact that the loop has run at least once, `_` will hold the number of iterations minus one, `n` will retain its original value as the input integer, `cx` will be a set containing every unique `x` value that was input during the loop, `ax` will be the smallest `x` value encountered during the loop (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` was smaller than this value), and `bx` will be the largest `x` value encountered during the loop (or -1 if no valid `x` was larger than -1).
