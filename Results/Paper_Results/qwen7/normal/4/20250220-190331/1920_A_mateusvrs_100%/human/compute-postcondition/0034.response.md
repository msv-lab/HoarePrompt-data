Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`; otherwise, `cx` becomes a set containing `x` and `ax` remains unchanged.
