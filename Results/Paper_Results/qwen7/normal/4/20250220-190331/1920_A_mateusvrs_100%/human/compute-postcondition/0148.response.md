Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

The code updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Since `x` and `ax` are both input integers, `ax` will take the smaller of the two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
