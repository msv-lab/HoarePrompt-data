Output State: **`i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is the same, `ax` is the same, `tmp` is `tmp` + 1**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `bx`, `ax`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still the next element in `cx`, `bx` is the same, `ax` is the same, and `tmp` is now one more than its original value.
