Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, and `x` is an integer from the input. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, and `ax` remains 1000000007. If `a` does not equal 1, then `cx` becomes a set containing `x`, and `ax` becomes the minimum of `x` and 1000007.
