Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1; `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1 is preserved, and now `a` and `x` are updated to the values provided by the user.
