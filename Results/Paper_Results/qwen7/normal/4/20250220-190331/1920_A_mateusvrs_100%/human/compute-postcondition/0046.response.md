Output State: **`i` is an integer, `bx` and `ax` are integers where `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `i`, `bx`, and `ax` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still an integer, `bx` and `ax` are still integers where `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is increased by 1.
