Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes variables and sets up the necessary data structures to process the constraints.
2. It iterates over each test case and processes the constraints to determine the valid range for `k`.
3. For each test case, it calculates the potential range of `k` using `ax` (the minimum upper bound) and `bx` (the maximum lower bound).
4. It handles the case where the range is invalid (`bx > ax`) by appending `0` to the result list.
5. For valid ranges, it subtracts the count of excluded values (`tmp`) from the total number of integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`).
6. The logic for determining the valid range and excluding specific values is consistent with the problem statement.
7. The final result is correctly printed for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program accurately implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
