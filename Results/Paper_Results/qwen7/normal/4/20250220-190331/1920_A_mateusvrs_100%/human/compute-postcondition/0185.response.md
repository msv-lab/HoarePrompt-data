Postcondition: **`_` is `n`, `t` is at least 0, `n` is the input integer provided initially, `cx` is a set containing all the `x` values that were added during the loop iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 2`), `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values that were processed (either directly or through the condition `a == 1`), and either `r` is a list containing the value 0, or `r` has the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` has been processed, `tmp` is equal to the size of the original `cx`, and `i` is the last value from `cx` that met the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.**
