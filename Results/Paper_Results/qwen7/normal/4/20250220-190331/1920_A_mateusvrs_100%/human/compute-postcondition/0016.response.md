Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is not equal to 2**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially an empty set, after adding `x`, `cx` now contains the single element `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
