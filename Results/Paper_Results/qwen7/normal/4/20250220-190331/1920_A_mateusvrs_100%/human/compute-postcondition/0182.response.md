Postcondition: **`cx` is a set containing all the values from the original set except the one that was just used and the next value, `i` is the next value from the updated `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, the condition holds as specified. If not, the condition does not change.**
