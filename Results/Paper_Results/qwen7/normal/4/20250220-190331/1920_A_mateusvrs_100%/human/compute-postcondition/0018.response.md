Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `a` is not equal to 1.

Explanation: 
- If `a` equals 2, then `ax` becomes the minimum of `x` and 1000007, and `cx` remains an empty set.
- If `a` does not equal 2, then `cx` becomes a set containing `x`, and `ax` remains 1000007.
