Output State: **`tmp` is increased by 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, the current index `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `cx` must still contain at least one element, and the current index `i` is still within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`.
