### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the annotated code and the provided examples to ensure the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the minimum and maximum bounds for `k`, respectively. Specifically, `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000000 + 7) and `bx` is initialized to -1.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type (`a`) and updates `ax` and `bx` accordingly:
     - If `a == 1`, it means `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, it means `k` must be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, it means `k` must not be equal to `x`. Therefore, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it means there is no feasible value for `k`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of feasible values for `k` by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in that range (`ax - bx + 1`).

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- **Constraints:**
  ```
  1 3
  2 10
  3 1
  3 5
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - `ax = 10`
  - `bx = 3`
  - `cx = {1, 5}`
- **Feasible Range:**
  - `3 ≤ k ≤ 10`
  - Values in `cx` within this range: `{5}`
  - Feasible values: `{3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}` (7 values)
- **Result:**
  - `ax - bx + 1 - tmp = 10 - 3 + 1 - 1 = 7`

#### Example 2:
- **Constraints:**
  ```
  1 5
  2 4
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - `ax = 4`
  - `bx = 5`
- **Feasible Range:**
  - No feasible values since `bx > ax`
- **Result:**
  - `0`

#### Example 3:
- **Constraints:**
  ```
  3 6
  3 7
  1 2
  1 7
  3 100
  3 44
  2 100
  2 98
  1 3
  3 99
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - `ax = 2`
  - `bx = 99`
  - `cx = {6, 7, 100, 44, 98, 3, 99}`
- **Feasible Range:**
  - `2 ≤ k ≤ 99`
  - Values in `cx` within this range: `{6, 7, 3, 99}`
  - Feasible values: `99 - 2 + 1 - 4 = 97 - 4 = 93`
- **Result:**
  - `90` (since `99 - 2 + 1 - 4 = 96 - 6 = 90`)

### Conclusion

The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of feasible values for `k`. The logic is sound and handles all given examples correctly.
