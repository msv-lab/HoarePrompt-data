Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The only variable here is `_`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `_` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `_` is 2
   - `t` is at least 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`
   - `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`
   - `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `x` is an input integer

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`_` is 3, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**
