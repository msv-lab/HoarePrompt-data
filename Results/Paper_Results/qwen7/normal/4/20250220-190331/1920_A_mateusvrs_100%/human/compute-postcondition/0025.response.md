Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially either an empty set or a set containing `x`, after adding `x` to it, `cx` now contains `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
