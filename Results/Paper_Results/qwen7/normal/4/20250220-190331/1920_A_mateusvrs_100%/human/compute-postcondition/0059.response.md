Postcondition: `r` is a list, `t` is at least 1, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), and `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (-1 if no valid `x` is provided). If the maximum value `bx` is greater than the minimum value `ax`, then `r` contains 0. Otherwise, `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
