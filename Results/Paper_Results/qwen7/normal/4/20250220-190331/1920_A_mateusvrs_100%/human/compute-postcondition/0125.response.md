Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `cx`. This does not affect the values of `_`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the new variable `cx` is initialized as an empty set.
