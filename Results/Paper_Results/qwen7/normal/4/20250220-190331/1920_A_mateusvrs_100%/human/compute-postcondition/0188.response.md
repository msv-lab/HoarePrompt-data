Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a set of constraints. Each constraint is described by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The function ensures that there are at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique.**
