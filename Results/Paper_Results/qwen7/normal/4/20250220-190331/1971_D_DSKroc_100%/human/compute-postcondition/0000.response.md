Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, after executing the code, `t` will hold the integer value entered by the user, which must still be within the specified range.
