Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(s) - 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the provided state, `i` is initially set to `len(s) - 2`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`. Given that `i` starts at `len(s) - 2`, the loop will execute because `len(s) - 2 < len(s) - 1` is true.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is correctly set to `len(s) - 2` and that the condition `i < len(s) - 1` holds true.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `len(s) - 2`.
- `len(s) - 1` should be the upper limit for the loop, ensuring that `i` is less than this value.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `len(s) - 2`, `len(s) - 1` is the upper limit for the loop**
