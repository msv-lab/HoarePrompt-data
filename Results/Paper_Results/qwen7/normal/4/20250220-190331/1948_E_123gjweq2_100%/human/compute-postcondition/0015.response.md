Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(not_mid)`.
   - Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` being 0 (as per the `range` function).
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, so `i` should be 0 initially.

3. **Determine the Value of `not_mid`:**
   - The loop will execute `not_mid` times.
   - To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusted States

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

### Final State

State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0**

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once and sets up the initial conditions for the loop to proceed as expected.
