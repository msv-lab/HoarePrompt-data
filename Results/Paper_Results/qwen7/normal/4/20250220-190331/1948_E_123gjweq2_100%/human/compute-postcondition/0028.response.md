Functionality: **The function `make_array` takes two integers `left` and `right` (where `0 <= left < right < n`), and one integer `clique`. It modifies two arrays `arr` and `cliquess` in place. Specifically, it fills a portion of the `cliquess` array with the value `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` and from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`, where `mid` and `not_mid` are calculated based on `left`, `right`, `small_element`, and `big_element`. Additionally, it fills a portion of the `arr` array with values ranging from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in reverse order and from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` in ascending order. The function does not return anything.**
