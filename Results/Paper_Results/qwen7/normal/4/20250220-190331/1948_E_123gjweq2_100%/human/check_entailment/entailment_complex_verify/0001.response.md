### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It then calls the helper function `make_array` to fill the array `arr` and `cliquess` according to the specified rules.

2. **Helper Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` within the range `[left, right]` with elements and assigns the `clique` value to all elements in this range.
   - The logic inside `make_array` seems to split the range into two parts and fill them differently:
     - The first part fills elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
     - The second part fills elements from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`.

### Verification Against Problem Statement

1. **Distinct Assignments**:
   - The assignment of values to `arr` ensures that all elements are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. This is achieved by filling the array in a specific pattern that guarantees uniqueness.
   - The pattern used in `make_array` ensures that each segment of the array is filled with unique values. Since `small_element` starts from `left + 1` and increases linearly, and `big_element` decreases linearly from `right + 1`, the values remain distinct.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - Given the way `arr` is filled, the difference between indices and values will often satisfy this condition, forming cliques.
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the values might be assigned as follows:
     - `arr[0] = 1`, `arr[1] = 2`, `arr[2] = 3`, `arr[3] = 4`, `arr[4] = 5`
     - The pairs `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 3)`, `(2, 3)`, `(2, 4)`, `(3, 4)` will form cliques because `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 3`.

3. **Clique Partition**:
   - The `cliquess` array is used to assign each vertex to a specific clique.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that all elements in the same range (determined by `left` and `right`) are assigned the same clique number.
   - This ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: the first line contains the values assigned to vertices, the second line contains the number of cliques, and the third line contains the clique assignments.

### Edge Cases and Validity

- The function handles the case where `n` and `k` are within the specified ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 40, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n).
- The logic in `make_array` ensures that the array is filled correctly and the cliques are formed as required.
- The use of `ceil(n / k)` ensures that the number of cliques is minimized.

### Conclusion
