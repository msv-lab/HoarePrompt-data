Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will execute `mid` times. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:

- `i` will range from `0` to `mid - 1`.
- For each `i` in this range, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique`.
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i`.

In simpler terms, the `cliquess` array will be filled with `clique` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1`. The `arr` array will have values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in reverse order starting from index `left + mid - 1` down to `left`.

All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`) will retain their values from the initial state or previous iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(not_mid):
    arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
    cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0; `not_mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 3]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `cliquess[left + mid + 4]` is equal to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + 1]` is set to `big_element - 1`, `arr[left + mid + 2]` is set to `big_element - 2`, `arr[left + mid + 4]` is set to `big_element - 4`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
