Output State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `small_element + i`. Given that `i` was initially 1 and the code decrements `i` by 1 (`i -= 1`), `i` becomes 0. So, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is now `arr[left + mid - 0 - 1]` which simplifies to `arr[left + mid - 1]` and is set to `small_element + 0`, which is `small_element`. However, since the initial value of `arr[left + mid - 2]` was `small_element + 1`, and no other changes were made to `small_element`, the updated value remains `small_element + 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions except for `i` which is now 0.
