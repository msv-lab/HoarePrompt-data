Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Name**: The function `make_array` is called within `func_1`, but its definition is not visible inside `func_1`. This will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Array Initialization and Usage**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized but not properly used. The `arr` array is never filled with values, and the `cliquess` array is not used to store the partitioning information.

3. **Logic for Partitioning**: The logic for partitioning the vertices into cliques is flawed. The current implementation does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given constraints.

4. **Edge Condition Calculation**: The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not directly addressed in the provided code. The values assigned to `a_i` and the partitioning logic need to ensure that this condition holds for all pairs within the same clique.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    # Calculate the number of cliques needed
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    
    # Initialize the array to store the values assigned to each vertex
    arr = [0] * n
    
    # Assign values to vertices
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = i + 1
    
    # Determine the partitioning
    partition = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        for j in range(k):
            partition[i * k + j] = i + 1
    
    # Print the results
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*partition)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The values assigned to vertices are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
- The graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
- The partitioning logic ensures that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` holds for all pairs within the same clique.
