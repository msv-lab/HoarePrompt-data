The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2*n inclusive. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) as `ceil(n / k)`, initializes two arrays `arr` and `cliquess`, and fills `arr` using the `make_array` function based on the specified range and clique index. Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.
