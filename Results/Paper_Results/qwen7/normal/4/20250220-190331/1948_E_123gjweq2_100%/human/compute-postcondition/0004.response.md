Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `mid`.

3. **Determine the Value of `mid`**: From the given initial state, we know that `mid` is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{mid} = \left(\frac{(\text{right} + 1) - (\text{left} + 1) + 1}{2}\right)
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{mid} = \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2}\right)
   \]

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `mid` must be at least 1. This ensures that there is at least one iteration of the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need adjustment are `mid` and `i`. We need to ensure that `mid` is at least 1 and `i` starts from 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
