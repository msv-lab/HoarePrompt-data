Output State: **`mid` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `cliquess[left + 1]` is `clique`, `arr[left + mid - 2]` is `small_element + 1`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + 1 + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `small_element + i`. Given that `i` is 1, the new value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` becomes `small_element + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `small_element + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
