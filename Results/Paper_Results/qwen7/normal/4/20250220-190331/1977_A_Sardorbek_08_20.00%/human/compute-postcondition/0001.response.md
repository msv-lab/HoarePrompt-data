Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables involved in the loop head:
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The control variable is `a`.

2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an input integer.

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `a` is at least 1.

4. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `a`, `a` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - There is no direct dependency on `t` for the loop to execute, but `t` should still be within its specified range for consistency.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` being at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1**
