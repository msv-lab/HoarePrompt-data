Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `b` and `c` respectively. The variables `t`, `a`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since the exact value of `i` before the operation was not specified, we only know that `i` is now `i + 1`.
