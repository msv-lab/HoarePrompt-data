Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` and `c` are integers from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and `b` is not equal to `c`. If the current value of `b` is less than the current value of `c`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the current value of `a` modulo 2 is equal to the current value of `b` modulo 2, no changes are made. If not, no changes are made either.
