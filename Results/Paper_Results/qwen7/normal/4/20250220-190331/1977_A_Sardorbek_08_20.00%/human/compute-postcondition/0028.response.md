Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` must be at least 1.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`. Since no values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i` are used in the `print` statement, and the statement itself does not depend on any of these variables, the output will be a straightforward string.

Output: **Yes**
