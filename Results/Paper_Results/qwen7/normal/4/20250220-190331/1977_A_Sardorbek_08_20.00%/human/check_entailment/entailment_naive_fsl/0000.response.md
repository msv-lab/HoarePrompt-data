Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to check if the number of moves `b` is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes `c`. The logic in the program does not account for the fact that the difference between `b` and `c` must be even because each move either adds or removes exactly one cube. 

For example, consider the test case `(5, 3)`. Here, `b = 5` and `c = 3`, which means we need to remove 2 cubes from the tower. Since 5 - 3 = 2, which is even, it is possible to achieve this. However, the current implementation does not check this condition, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would be to check if `(b - c)` is even.
