Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `q = b, c` does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. It simply reassigns `q` to be a tuple containing `b` and `c`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since the initial state already mentioned `i` is `i + 1`, this is consistent and no further change is needed. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
