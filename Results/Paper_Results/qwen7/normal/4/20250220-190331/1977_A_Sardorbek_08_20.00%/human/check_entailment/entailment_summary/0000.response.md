Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if it's possible to have exactly \(m\) cubes after \(n\) moves.
- The program should check if \(n\) and \(m\) are equal, which would mean adding exactly \(m\) cubes (one at a time).
- If \(n < m\), it's impossible to add enough cubes, so the result should be 'NO'.
- The program checks if \(n\) and \(m\) have the same parity (both even or both odd) and prints 'Yes' if they do, which is correct because the parity of the number of moves must match the parity of the final number of cubes.
- However, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' when \(a \% 2 == b \% 2\) instead of checking if \(n \geq m\).

Given these points, the program is not entirely correct as it fails to handle the case where \(n < m\).

Correctness: **False**
