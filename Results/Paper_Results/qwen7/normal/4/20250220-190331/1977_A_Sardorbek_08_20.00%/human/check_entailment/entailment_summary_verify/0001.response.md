### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the program's logic is flawed, particularly in the handling of the conditions. However, the provided solution in the original assessment is not entirely correct. Let's break down the issues and provide the correct solution:

1. **Original Program Issues:**
   - The condition `if b == c:` is correct.
   - The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect because it assumes it's impossible to have more cubes than moves, which is not always true.
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is irrelevant and incorrect.
   - The `else` block is not correctly handling the remaining cases.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move (adding or removing a cube) changes the parity of the number of cubes. Therefore, the parity of `n` and `m` must be the same for it to be possible.

3. **Corrected Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       a = int(input())
       for i in range(a):
           (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
           if (b - c) % 2 == 0:
               print('Yes')
           else:
               print('No')
   ```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was partially correct in identifying the issues but did not provide the fully correct solution. The provided solution in the original assessment is close but not entirely accurate. The correct solution involves checking the parity of the difference between `n` and `m`.

**Final: False**
