Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` must be at least 1, `b` and `c` are integers from the input, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. If `b` is equal to `c`, then `b` and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `b` is less than `c`, `b` remains unchanged. If `a` modulo 2 is equal to `b` modulo 2, no changes are made to `b` and `c`. If `a` modulo 2 is not equal to `b` modulo 2, no changes are made to `b` and `c` either.
