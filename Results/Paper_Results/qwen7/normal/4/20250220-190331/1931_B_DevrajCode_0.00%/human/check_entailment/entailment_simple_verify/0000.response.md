### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the necessary logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into individual components.
   - `n` is assigned the number of containers.
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` and `a` as arguments.
   - It first calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(a)`.
   - It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - It calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `container` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and updates `container` by adding `water - target` for each element.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it returns 'No', indicating that it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it returns 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

The logic implemented in the program matches the requirements of the problem statement. The program correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the conditions for making all containers have the same amount of water are met.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logical steps implemented in the code.
