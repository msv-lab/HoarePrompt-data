Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for water in a:`. Here, the objects involved are `water` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `water` will take on each element from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - `water` takes on the value of each element in `a` one by one.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `water` will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration, we need to ensure that `a` contains the correct elements.
   - The initial value of `water` is not specified, but it will be set to the first element of `a` in the first iteration.

Given the initial conditions:
- `container` is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop).
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of containers.
- The sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.
- `target` is the result of `total_water // n`.

Since the loop is iterating over the elements of `a`, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that `a` is correctly initialized and contains the elements whose sum is `total_water`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`, target is the result of `total_water // n`**
