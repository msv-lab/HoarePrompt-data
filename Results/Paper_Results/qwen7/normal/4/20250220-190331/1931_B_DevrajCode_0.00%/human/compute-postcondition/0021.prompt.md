Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `container` is 0, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of containers, and the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`; `target` is the result of `total_water // n`.
Code of the loop:
for water in a:
    container += water - target
    if container < 0:
        return 'No'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `container` is increased by `water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`, `target` is the result of `total_water // n`, and `container` is greater than or equal to 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `container` is increased by `water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` is a list of elements whose sum is `total_water`, `target` is the result of `total_water // n`. If `container` is less than 0, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`. If `container` is less than 0, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, no specific return value is mentioned.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
