Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, and the values of `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user. If `a` and `b` are both odd, no change is made to the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, no change is made to the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.**
