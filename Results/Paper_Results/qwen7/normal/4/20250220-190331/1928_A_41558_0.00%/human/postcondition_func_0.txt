The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it checks if `a` and `b` are both odd, or if `a / 2` equals `b` or `b / 2` equals `a`. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified.
