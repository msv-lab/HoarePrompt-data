Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the \(a \times b\) rectangle by checking specific conditions. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO', which is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles without leaving a remainder.
   - It also checks if \(a / 2\) equals \(b\) or \(b / 2\) equals \(a\). If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'. This is incorrect because if \(a / 2 = b\) or \(b / 2 = a\), it means one dimension is exactly half of the other, and such a division would result in two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. For example, a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle can be divided into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and then rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle again, which is not considered a new rectangle, but a \(2 \times 4\) rectangle would be a new rectangle.
3. **Printing 'YES'**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES', which is correct because the remaining cases allow for the formation of a new rectangle.

Given the analysis, the current implementation incorrectly identifies some cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the condition `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` should not lead to a 'NO' output because it does not prevent the formation of a new rectangle under certain circumstances.

Therefore, the program needs to be corrected to handle these edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**
