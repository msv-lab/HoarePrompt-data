Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second integers from the input split respectively.
