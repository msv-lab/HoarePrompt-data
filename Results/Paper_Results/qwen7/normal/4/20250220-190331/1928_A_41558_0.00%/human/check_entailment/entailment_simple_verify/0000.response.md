### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

- **Program Flow**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
  - It then iterates over each test case, reading `a` and `b`.
  - It checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints 'NO'.
  - It checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Both dimensions are odd (`a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`)**
   - The program correctly prints 'NO' because a rectangle with both dimensions odd cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into another rectangle.
   
2. **Case 2: One dimension is exactly half the other (`a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`)**
   - The program correctly prints 'NO' because this configuration means the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into another rectangle.

3. **Case 3: Neither of the above conditions are met**
   - The program prints 'YES'. However, this is not always correct. For example, a 2x1 rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into another rectangle. The program should print 'NO' for this case.

#### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1: 1 1**
  - Both dimensions are 1, which is odd. The program prints 'NO', which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 2: 2 1**
  - One dimension is 1, which is odd. The program prints 'NO', which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 3: 2 6**
  - The program correctly identifies that it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and reformed into a 4x3 rectangle. It prints 'YES', which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 4: 3 2**
  - The program correctly identifies that it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and reformed into a 1x6 rectangle. It prints 'YES', which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 5: 2 2**
  - The program correctly identifies that it can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles and reformed into a 1x4 rectangle. It prints 'YES', which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 6: 2 4**
  - The program correctly identifies that it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles and reformed into a 4x2 rectangle. It prints 'YES', which is correct.
  
- **Test Case 7: 6 3**
  - The program correctly identifies that it can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles and reformed into a 6x3 rectangle. It prints 'NO', which is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The program fails to handle the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is greater than 1. Specifically, it incorrectly prints 'YES' for the 2x1 rectangle, which should be 'NO'. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
