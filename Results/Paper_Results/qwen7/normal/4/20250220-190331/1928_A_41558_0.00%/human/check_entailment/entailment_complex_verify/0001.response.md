### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program. Specifically, the conditions for printing 'NO' are too restrictive and do not cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Let's break down the issues and provide a more accurate solution.

1. **Odd Dimensions Check:**
   - The condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` correctly identifies that if both dimensions are odd, no new rectangle can be formed because cutting an odd-sized rectangle results in at least one dimension being even.

2. **Equal Halves Check:**
   - The condition `a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is problematic. This condition only checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is a very specific scenario. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged into a 4x3 rectangle. However, the current condition would incorrectly mark this as 'NO'.

To fix this, we need to consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and check if the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

- If either dimension is even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
- If both dimensions are odd, no new rectangle can be formed.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, we can still form a new rectangle by cutting the even dimension and rearranging the pieces.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `n` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Printing 'YES':**
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, the program prints 'YES'. This covers all cases where a new rectangle can be formed by cutting the even dimension.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'NO'. This correctly identifies that no new rectangle can be formed.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** \(1 \times 1\)
  - Both dimensions are odd, so it prints 'NO' (correct).

- **Test Case 2:** \(2 \times 1\)
  - One dimension is even, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

- **Test Case 3:** \(2 \times 6\)
  - One dimension is even, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

- **Test Case 4:** \(3 \times 2\)
  - One dimension is even, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

- **Test Case 5:** \(2 \times 2\)
  - Both dimensions are even, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

- **Test Case 6:** \(2 \times 4\)
  - Both dimensions are even, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

- **Test Case 7:** \(6 \times 3\)
  - Both dimensions are even, so it prints 'YES' (correct).

### Conclusion:
The revised program correctly handles all cases where a new rectangle can be formed and avoids the issues present in the original program.
