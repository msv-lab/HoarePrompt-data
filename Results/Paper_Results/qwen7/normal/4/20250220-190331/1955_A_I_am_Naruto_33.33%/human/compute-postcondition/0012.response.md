Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `ans1` is defined and equals `a * n`, `ans2` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * n` to `ans1`. Since the condition `n > 1` is not specified in the initial state, `ans1` is defined and equals `a * n`. The value of `ans2` remains undefined because the condition `n > 1` is not met to define it. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
