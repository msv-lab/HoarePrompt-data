Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user and is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, `ans2` is b * n // 2 + a * n % 2.**

The code calculates `ans2` based on the values of `b`, `n`, and `a`. Specifically, `ans2` is computed as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `ans1` remains as the product of `a` and `n`.
