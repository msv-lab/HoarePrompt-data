Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that `n > 1`
- `a` is the second integer entered by the user
- `b` is the third integer entered by the user
- `ans1` is `a * n`
- `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

Let's break down the expressions for `ans1` and `ans2`:

1. **`ans1 = a * n`**: This is simply the product of `a` and `n`.
2. **`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`**: 
   - `b * n // 2`: This is the integer division of `b * n` by 2.
   - `a * n % 2`: This is the remainder when `a * n` is divided by 2.

To find `min(ans1, ans2)`, we need to compare these two values.

### Case Analysis:
- If `n` is even:
  - `n // 2` is an integer.
  - `n % 2` is 0.
  - Therefore, `ans2 = b * n // 2`.
  - `ans1 = a * n`.
  - Since `n > 1`, `a * n` will generally be larger than `b * n // 2` unless `b` is very large compared to `a`.

- If `n` is odd:
  - `n // 2` is an integer.
  - `n % 2` is 1.
  - Therefore, `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a`.
  - `ans1 = a * n`.
  - Since `n > 1`, `a * n` will generally be larger than `b * n // 2 + a` unless `b` is significantly larger than `a`.

In both cases, the smaller value between `ans1` and `ans2` will be printed.

### Conclusion:
The exact value depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, but the expression `min(ans1, ans2)` will evaluate to the smaller of `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**
