Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `n` is the new integer input from the user, `ans1` is defined and equals `a * n`, `ans2` is defined and equals `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans2` based on the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. `ans1` was already defined as `a * n`, and now `ans2` is also defined according to the given formula.
