Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`, and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, no new variables `ans1` and `ans2` are defined, and the original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
