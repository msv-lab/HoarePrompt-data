Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user.**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input condition is met and no further operations are performed on `t`.
