Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts without any promotion (`ans1 = a * n`).
4. It also calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion as much as possible (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`), which ensures that even if `n` is odd, the remaining yogurt is bought at the regular price.
5. It prints the minimum of these two calculated costs.
6. The logic handles both cases where `n` is greater than 1 and where `n` is 1 or less appropriately.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the program, it appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
