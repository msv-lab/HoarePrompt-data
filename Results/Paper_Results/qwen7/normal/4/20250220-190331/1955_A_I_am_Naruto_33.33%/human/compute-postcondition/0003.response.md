Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user and is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, `ans1` is the product of `a` and `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * n` to the variable `ans1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
