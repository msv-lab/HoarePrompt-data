Postcondition: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user. If `n > 1`, then `ans1` is set to `a * n` and `ans2` is set to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is not greater than 1 (which is not possible given the precondition), `ans1` remains undefined and `ans2` remains undefined.
