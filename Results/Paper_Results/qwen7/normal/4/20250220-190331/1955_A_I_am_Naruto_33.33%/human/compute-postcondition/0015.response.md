Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `b` is the third integer entered by the user.
- `n` is the new integer input from the user.
- `ans1` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `a * n`, otherwise it is undefined.
- `ans2` is defined if `n > 1` and equals `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, otherwise it is undefined.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`, which is the second integer entered by the user.

Output: **a (where a is the second integer entered by the user)**
