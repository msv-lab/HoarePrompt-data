Output State: **`A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex IDs and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1)**.

The code initializes a stack with a single tuple `(1, 1)`. The values of `A`, `g`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
