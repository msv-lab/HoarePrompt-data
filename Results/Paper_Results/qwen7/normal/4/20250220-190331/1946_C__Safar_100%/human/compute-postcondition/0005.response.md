Output State: **`r` is 0, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex IDs and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `x` is 1, `p` is 1**

Explanation: The code `x, p = stack[-1]` assigns the last element of the `stack` list to `x` and `p`. Since `stack` contains only one tuple `(1, 1)`, both `x` and `p` are assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
