Based on the initial state provided, we know that `l` is greater than `r`. This means that the binary search algorithm has narrowed down the search space to a point where the lower bound (`l`) is now greater than the upper bound (`r`). 

Since the `print(r)` statement is executed after the binary search loop has terminated due to `l > r`, the value printed will be the last value of `r` before the loop condition was no longer satisfied.

Output: **r (where r is the last value of r before l became greater than r)**
