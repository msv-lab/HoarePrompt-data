Output State: **`node` is a node in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and `stack` contains the tuple (`node`, `x`) if `node` is not equal to `p`, and now `stack` has appended the tuple (`node`, `x`).**

This means that the tuple (`node`, `x`) has been added to the `stack`. The conditions for `node` and `stack` remain the same as the initial state, but now `stack` includes the newly added tuple.
