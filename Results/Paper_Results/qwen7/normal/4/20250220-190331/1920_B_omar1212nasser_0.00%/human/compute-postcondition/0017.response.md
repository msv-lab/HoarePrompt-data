Output State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, `s` is `s - 2 * n - elements[-2]`, `n` is 0 if an `IndexError` occurred, otherwise `n` is the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]`, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n]`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `try` block attempts to update the value of `n` using the expression `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`. Here, `i` is set to 3, so the expression becomes `n += elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`.
2. An `IndexError` can occur if the index `-(negatives + 3)` or `-3` is out of bounds for the `elements` list. This would happen if `negatives + 3` is greater than the length of `elements` minus one or if `negatives` is negative and its absolute value plus 3 exceeds the length of `elements`.
3. If an `IndexError` occurs, the `except` block sets `n` to 0.
4. If no `IndexError` occurs, the value of `n` is updated according to the expression in the `try` block.
5. The `pos` list is then updated to be `[s - 2 * n]`.

Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
