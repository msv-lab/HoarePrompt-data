Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Hardcoded Condition**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3:` which returns `0`. This condition is specific and does not generalize the logic needed for the problem. It should handle all possible values of `removals` and `negatives`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Positive Elements Calculation**: The logic inside `func_2` for calculating the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob's moves is flawed. Specifically, the way positive elements are calculated and subtracted is incorrect. The approach should consider the optimal way to remove elements and negate elements to maximize the sum for Alice and minimize it for Bob.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation and the way elements are processed do not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for both players. The current implementation does not account for the dynamic nature of the problem where the best strategy might involve different combinations of removals and negations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Alice's Optimal Move**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
3. **Bob's Optimal Move**: Bob should negate the smallest negative impact elements to minimize the sum.
4. **Calculate Final Sum**: After Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements, calculate the final sum.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Remove k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Negate x smallest remaining elements
        negations = min(x, len(a))
        a[:negations] = [-num for num in a[:negations]]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        final_sum = sum(a)
        print(final_sum)

# Call the main function
func_1()
```

This solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and handles the problem as described.
