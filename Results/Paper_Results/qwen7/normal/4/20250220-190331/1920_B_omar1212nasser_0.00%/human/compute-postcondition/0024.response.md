Output State: **`removals` must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `n` is either the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]` if no `IndexError`, otherwise `n` is 0, and `pos` is `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]; pos now includes `s - 2 * n`**.

Explanation: The code appends `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Since `pos` was initially `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, appending `s - 2 * n` again results in `pos` being `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`. The values of `removals`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged unless an `IndexError` occurs when calculating `n`.
