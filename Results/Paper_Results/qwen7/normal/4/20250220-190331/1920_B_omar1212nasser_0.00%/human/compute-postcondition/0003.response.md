Output State: **removals is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers; pos is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `pos`. This does not affect the values of `removals`, `negatives`, or the `elements` list. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
