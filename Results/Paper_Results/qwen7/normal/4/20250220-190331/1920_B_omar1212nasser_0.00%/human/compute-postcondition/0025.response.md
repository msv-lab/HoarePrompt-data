Output State: `removals` must be at least 4, `i` is `removals + 1`, `n` is the final value calculated based on the loop iterations, `s` is `s - elements[-1]` after removing `removals` elements, and `pos` is a list containing `removals` elements, each being `s - 2 * n`.

In this final state, `removals` will have reached its maximum value as defined initially. The variable `i` will be one more than the total number of iterations (`removals + 1`). The variable `n` will hold the cumulative adjustment made during each iteration, considering the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `s` will reflect the sum of the `elements` list after removing the last `removals` elements. The list `pos` will contain `removals` elements, each computed as `s - 2 * n`, reflecting the result of the last iteration's calculation.
