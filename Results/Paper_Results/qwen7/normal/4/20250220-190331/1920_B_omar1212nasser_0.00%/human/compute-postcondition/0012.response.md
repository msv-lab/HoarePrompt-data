Output State: **`removals` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-1]`, `n` is either the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` if no `IndexError` occurred, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Since `s` is already defined as `s - elements[-1]`, and `n` is defined based on whether an `IndexError` occurs or not, the only new information here is that `pos` now contains the value `s - 2 * n`. All other variables remain in their previously defined states.
