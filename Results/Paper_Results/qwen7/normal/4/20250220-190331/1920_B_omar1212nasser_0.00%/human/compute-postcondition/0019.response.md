Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `removals`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range of `1` to `removals + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `removals` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `n` is the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError`, otherwise `n` is 0.
   - `pos` is `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `removals`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `removals` must be at least 4.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `removals` must be at least 4 (since `i` will be 4 in the next iteration).
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless there is an `IndexError`, but since we are adjusting the state before the next iteration, we assume no `IndexError` and thus `n` remains as it was.
   - `pos` remains `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`removals` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `n` is the updated value of `n + elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError`, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` is `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`**.
