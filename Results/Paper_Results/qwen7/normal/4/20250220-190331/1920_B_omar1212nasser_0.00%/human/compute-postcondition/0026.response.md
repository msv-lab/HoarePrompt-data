Output State: `removals` must be at least 4, `i` is equal to `removals`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements` minus the last `removals` elements, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the elements from `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` to `elements[-removals]` if no `IndexError` occurred, otherwise `n` is 0, and `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `removals` will be the final number of iterations performed, `i` will be equal to `removals`, `s` will be the initial sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, `n` will be the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` adjusted by subtracting the sum of elements from `elements[-(negatives + 1)]` to `elements[-removals]` if no `IndexError` occurred, and `pos` will contain the value `s - 2 * n` repeated `removals` times.
