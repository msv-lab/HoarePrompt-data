Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`, so the relevant variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `max_item_idx` is 3
   - `pair_idx` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans1` is either '<' or '='
   - If `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is the result of evaluating `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`
   - If `ans1` is not '=', then `ans2` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop itself, so `n` remains the same.
   - The values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `ans1`, and `ans2` do not depend on the loop variable `i` and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans1` is either '<' or '=', and if `ans1` is '=', then `ans2` is the result of evaluating `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. If `ans1` is not '=', then `ans2` remains unchanged.**
