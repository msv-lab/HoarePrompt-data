Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the XOR value \( p_i \oplus p_j \) using at most \(3n\) queries. Here's why:

1. **Query Strategy**: The function `func_2` attempts to find the index with the maximum bitwise OR value (`max_item_idx`) by comparing it with other indices. However, it only considers single comparisons between `max_item_idx` and `i`, without considering the combined effect of multiple bits.

2. **Finding Maximum XOR Pair**: The problem requires finding a pair \((i, j)\) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The current approach does not ensure that the selected pair will have the maximum XOR value. It only finds the index with the highest individual bitwise OR value, which is not sufficient to guarantee the maximum XOR.

3. **Query Limit**: While the code adheres to the query limit of \(3n\), it does not employ an optimal strategy to identify the pair with the maximum XOR value. The approach needs to consider the combined effect of multiple bits across different indices to find the optimal pair.

### Suggested Approach:
A more effective approach would involve querying in a way that considers the combined effect of multiple bits. One possible strategy is to use a divide-and-conquer approach to narrow down the indices with high potential for maximizing the XOR value.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
import sys

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    request = f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}\n'
    sys.stdout.write(request)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

def func_2(n):
    def query(a, b, c, d):
        return func_1(a, b, c, d)

    def find_max_xor_pair(n):
        low, high = 0, n - 1
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Query to check if we can find a better candidate in the lower half
            ans = query(low, mid, mid + 1, high)
            if ans == '<':
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        # Now low points to the index with the highest potential for maximum XOR
        max_index = low
        pair_index = -1
        for i in range(n):
            ans = query(max_index, i, max_index, i)
            if ans == '=':
                pair_index = i
                break
            elif ans == '>':
                pair_index = i
                break
        return max_index, pair_index

    max_index, pair_index = find_max_xor_pair(n)
    print(f'! {max_index} {pair_index}')

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    func_2(n)
```

This revised approach uses a binary search-like method to find the index with the highest potential for maximizing the XOR value and then checks for the best pair using additional queries. This ensures that the solution adheres to the \(3n\) query limit and aims to find the optimal pair.
