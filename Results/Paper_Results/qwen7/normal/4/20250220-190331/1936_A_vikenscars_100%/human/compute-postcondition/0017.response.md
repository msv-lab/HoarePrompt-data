Output State: **max_item_idx is 3.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `max_item_idx` will be 3. This is because the loop increments `max_item_idx` to the current value of `i` whenever `ans` is '<'. Given that `ans` was '<' in the first two iterations (as per the provided output states), `max_item_idx` was updated to 1, then to 2, and then to 3 in the third iteration. The loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-1`, so after three iterations, `i` would have reached 3, and since the condition `ans == '<'` was met in the first two iterations but not necessarily in the third, `max_item_idx` remains 3.
