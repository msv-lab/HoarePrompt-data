Postcondition: `max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is '>' if the condition `ans2 == '>'` is true. If the condition `ans2 == '>'` is false, then the postcondition remains as `max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is '=', and `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`.
