Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` is 3
   - `pair_idx` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`
   - `ans2` is either the result of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)` or remains unchanged.

4. **Update `i` for the Next Iteration**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

5. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

6. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must be less than `n`.

7. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

8. **Values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, and `ans1` and `ans2`**: These values remain unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 0, 3, 1)`, and `ans2` is either the result of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)` or remains unchanged. If `ans1` equals '<', then `ans2` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`. Otherwise, the values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged. `n` must be greater than 2.**
