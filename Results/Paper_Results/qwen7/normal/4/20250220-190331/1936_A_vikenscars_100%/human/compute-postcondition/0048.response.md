Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(3, 1, 3, 2)`, and `ans2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns `ans1` the value of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, which translates to `func_1(3, 1, 3, 2)`. The values of `max_item_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `ans1` are updated accordingly. Since `ans1` is not compared with any condition to change `ans2`, `ans2` remains unchanged. The initial conditions of `n` being greater than 2 are also preserved.
