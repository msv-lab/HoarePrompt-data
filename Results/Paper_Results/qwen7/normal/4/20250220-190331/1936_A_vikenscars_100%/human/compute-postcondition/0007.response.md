Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is '<'

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to `2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `max_item_idx` and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_item_idx` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is '<'**
