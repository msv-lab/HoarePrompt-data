### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.
   - It calls `func_2(n)` to start the process of finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly formats and prints the query in the required format.
   - It reads the response from the input, which is a comparison result ('<', '=', '>'), and returns it.
   - The function handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function starts by setting `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it makes a query using `func_1` to compare `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_{max_item_idx})` and `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`. This step aims to find the index with the highest single value when OR'd with itself.
   - After finding the `max_item_idx`, it iterates through all indices again to find the second index `pair_idx` that maximizes the XOR value with `max_item_idx`.
   - For each index `i`, it makes a query to compare `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_{pair_idx})` and `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_i)`.
     - If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - If the response is `=`, it further checks with another query to ensure `pair_idx` is indeed the better choice.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

4. **Query and Response Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the responses from the queries and updates the indices accordingly.
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair seems sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final answer in the required format after determining the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem specification correctly and performs the necessary steps to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized within the allowed number of queries.

### Correctness:
**True**
