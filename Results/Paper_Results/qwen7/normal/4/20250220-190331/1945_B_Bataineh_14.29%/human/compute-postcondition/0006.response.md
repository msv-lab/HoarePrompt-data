Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer and it is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Here, `//` denotes integer division. Since `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, `m // a` and `m // b` will both be at least 1 (if `a` and `b` are positive). Therefore, the expression simplifies to at least `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.

However, without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `m`, we cannot determine the exact result but we know it will be an integer value that is at least 4.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m, a, and b are input integers with m >= a and m >= b)**
