State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop condition `i in range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. The value of `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
5. Therefore, before the loop starts, `t` must be within this range and specifically, it must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
6. The initial value of `i` is 0, as specified in the loop definition.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is valid and `i` starts at 0.
