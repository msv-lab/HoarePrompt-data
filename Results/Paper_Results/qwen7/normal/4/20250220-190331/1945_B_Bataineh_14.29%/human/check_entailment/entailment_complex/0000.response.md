Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. If true, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\).
4. This logic aligns with the problem statement. When `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2 because no two fireworks from different installations can overlap within the visibility period. Otherwise, the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\) correctly accounts for the possibility of simultaneous launches from both installations.
5. The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\) appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
