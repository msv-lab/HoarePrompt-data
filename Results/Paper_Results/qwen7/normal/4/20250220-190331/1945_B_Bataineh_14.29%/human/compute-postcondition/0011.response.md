Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `b` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The `print` statement simply outputs the number 2. Since there are no dependencies on the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, or `t` for this specific print statement, it will always print the number 2 regardless of the input values.

Output: **2**
