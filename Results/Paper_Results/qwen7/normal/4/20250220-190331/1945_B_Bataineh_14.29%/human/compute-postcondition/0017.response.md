Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the values entered by the user.

The print statement is:

```python
print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

Here, `//` is the floor division operator, which performs division and then rounds down to the nearest whole number. Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are determined by user input, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer without knowing those values. However, we can describe the expression being evaluated.

The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` will add the results of the floor division of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b`, and then add 2 to the result.

Given this, the output will be:

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m, a, and b are the values entered by the user)**
