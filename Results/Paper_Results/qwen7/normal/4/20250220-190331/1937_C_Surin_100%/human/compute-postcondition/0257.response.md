Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` reaching `n`. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. After the loop completes, `v1` will be `n-1`, `v2` will be `n-1`, and `prev` will be `n`. All necessary `sys.stdout.flush()` calls have been made to ensure proper execution flow.
