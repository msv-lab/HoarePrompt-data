Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`, the user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration, `prev` retains its previous value.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Since the initial state does not specify what `i` is, `v2` is simply assigned the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
