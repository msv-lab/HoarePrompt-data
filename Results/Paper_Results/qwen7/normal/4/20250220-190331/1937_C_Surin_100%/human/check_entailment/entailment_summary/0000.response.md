Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of indices.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code defines a function `func()` that processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \(n\) of the permutation.
   - It initializes `v1` to 0 and iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) to find a candidate index `v1` such that \(p_{v1}\) is the highest when compared using bitwise OR with itself.
   - Then, it iterates again to find another index `prev` that maximizes the bitwise OR with `v1`.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the solution.

3. **Query Strategy**:
   - The first loop aims to find an index `v1` such that \(p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}\) is high. This is done by comparing \(p_i \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}\).
   - The second loop aims to find an index `prev` that maximizes the bitwise OR with `v1`. This is done by comparing \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The strategy of finding `v1` and `prev` seems logical but needs verification.
   - The first loop correctly identifies a candidate `v1` by comparing \(p_i \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{v1}\).
   - The second loop correctly identifies `prev` by comparing \(p_{v1} \mid p_i\) with \(p_{v1} \mid p_{prev}\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the permutation is small (e.g., \(n = 2\)) and correctly identifies the indices.
   - The code ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code appears to be sound and should work within the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
