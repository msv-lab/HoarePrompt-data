Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is stated to be greater than 2, but its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement.
- `prev` is referenced in the print statement but is not defined in the initial state. Since `prev` is not defined, it will be treated as a variable without a specific value.

Given these points, the print statement will output a formatted string with the placeholders for `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`. Since `i` is 3, and `prev` is undefined, the output will include these placeholders.

Output: **? 3 3 prev prev**
