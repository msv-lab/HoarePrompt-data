Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `r` is explicitly set to '='.
   - `r` is not equal to '>'.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement uses a formatted string with placeholders for `i`, `i`, `prev`, and `prev`.
   - `i` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. Since `prev` is not mentioned in the initial state and no default value is provided, we assume it is undefined or not relevant to the output based on the given context.

Given the above analysis, since `prev` is not defined and does not affect the output directly (as it appears twice), the output will be based on the defined values.

Output: **? 1 1 = =**
