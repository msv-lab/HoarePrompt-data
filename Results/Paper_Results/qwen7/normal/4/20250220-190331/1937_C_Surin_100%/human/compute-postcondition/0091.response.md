State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, the user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration, `prev` retains its previous value**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` requires `n > 1` to produce any values.
3. The variables `kp`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute; therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of each iteration, but since we are only concerned with the initial state before the loop starts, we do not need to specify its value here.
5. The user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration, which implies that `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `n` must be greater than 1.
