Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is '=', `r2` is '<', `prev` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the new variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` is now 1, while `i`, `n`, `r`, and `r2` retain their original values.
