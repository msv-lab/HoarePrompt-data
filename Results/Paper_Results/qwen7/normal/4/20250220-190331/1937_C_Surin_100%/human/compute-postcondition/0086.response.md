Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `i` being equal to `n-1`. The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The variable `prev` is set to `n-1` if any input resulted in `r` or `r2` being `'> '` or `'<'` respectively during the loop's execution. Otherwise, `prev` retains its previous value. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the conditions of the variables. It simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their previous states.
