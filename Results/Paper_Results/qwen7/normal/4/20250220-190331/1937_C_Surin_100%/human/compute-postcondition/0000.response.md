Output State: **A lambda function `I` is defined that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. No variables are assigned any values, and the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) remains unchanged.**

The code defines a lambda function `I` that processes input, but no variables are assigned specific values, and the permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) remains as a hidden permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\). Therefore, the output state retains the definition of the lambda function and the existence of the hidden permutation without any changes.
