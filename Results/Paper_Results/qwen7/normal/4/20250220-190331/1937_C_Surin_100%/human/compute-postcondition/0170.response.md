Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations. The final value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `r` is the input value from the last iteration, and `prev` is `n-1`.**

In this final state, after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, as the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.
- The variable `n` must be greater than 1, and after all iterations, it must still satisfy this condition.
- The variable `r` will hold the input value from the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `prev` will be set to `n-1` based on the conditions checked within the loop.
