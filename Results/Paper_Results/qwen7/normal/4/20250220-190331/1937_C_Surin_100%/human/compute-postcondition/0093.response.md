Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is `i`, where `i` is the user's input for the range of the next iteration.
- `prev` retains its previous value, but since no previous value is mentioned, it is not relevant to this specific print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Here, `v1` is explicitly stated to be 0. `v2` is `i`, which is the user's input for the range of the next iteration. Since the user needs to provide a new input to set the range for the next iteration, `v2` will be the user's input value.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 0 0 [user's input] [user's input]**
