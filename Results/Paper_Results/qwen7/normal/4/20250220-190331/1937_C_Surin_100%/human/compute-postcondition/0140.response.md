Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means that for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `r` is either '>' or '='
   - If `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is '=', and the current value of `r2` is '<', then `prev` is set to 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 2, it needs to be less than `n`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.
   - The values of `r`, `prev`, and `r2` do not change based on the loop head alone, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is either '>' or '=', if `r` is '>', then `prev` is 1, if `r` is '=', and the current value of `r2` is '<', then `prev` is set to 1**
