Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to I/O and does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
