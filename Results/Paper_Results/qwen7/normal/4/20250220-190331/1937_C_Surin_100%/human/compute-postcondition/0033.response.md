Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the original input integer, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `prev = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `prev`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
