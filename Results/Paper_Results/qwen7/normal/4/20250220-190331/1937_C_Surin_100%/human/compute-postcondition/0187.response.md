Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is a new input integer which is greater than `n-1`
- `v2` is 2

However, there is no explicit definition for `v1` in the initial state. Since `v1` is not defined, it is not clear what its value should be. Given the context, if we assume `v1` is intended to be the same as `v2`, then `v1` would also be 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Given the assumptions:
- `v1` is 2
- `v2` is 2

The output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 2 2**
