Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is described as being greater than 2, but no specific value is given, so we cannot determine its exact value.
- `r` is an input string, but no specific value is given, so we cannot determine its exact content.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

We need to identify the values of `v1` and `prev`. Since these variables are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the output will include placeholders for these undefined variables.

Output: **'? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev]'**
