Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its specific value is not given.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

From the statement itself, it's clear that:
- `i` is 1.
- `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
- `prev` is also not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

Given this, the output will include placeholders for `v1` and `prev`, along with the explicit value of `i`.

Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev]**
