### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The program needs to handle up to 1000 test cases, where `X` can be as large as \(10^{18}\).

2. **Key Insight**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be determined by the lengths of its longest increasing subsequences (LIS). Specifically, if we have an array of length `n` with `k` distinct values, the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using combinations.

3. **Approach in the Code**:
   - The code attempts to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the lengths of the LIS needed to achieve the desired count of increasing subsequences.
   - For each bit position in the binary representation of `X`, it tries to add a new value to the array, ensuring the count of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when `X` is 2 and prints `[0]`.
   - For other values of `X`, it constructs an array by adding elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - The logic for constructing the array seems to follow the principle of breaking down `X` into powers of 2, which helps in achieving the exact count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 correctly.
   - For larger values of `X`, the code constructs arrays that meet the requirement, although the specific construction might not always be optimal or unique.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The code outputs the length of the array followed by the array itself.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for generating an array with a specified number of increasing subsequences. It handles the edge case of `X` being 2 and constructs arrays for larger values of `X` in a manner that satisfies the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
