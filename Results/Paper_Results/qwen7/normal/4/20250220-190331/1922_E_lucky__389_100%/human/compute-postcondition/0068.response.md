Output State: `mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) + 1`, `len(subseq_lens)` is at least 4, `ansv` is a list that now contains three additional elements which are `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `subseq_lens[i]` to `ansv` for each iteration where `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration. After 3 iterations, `i` would be 4 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time), and `subseq_lens` would contain at least 4 elements. Therefore, `ansv` will have been updated to include the values of `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]`.
