Output State: `mx` is the maximum value found among the values appended to `subseq_lens`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i - 1` found during each iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0, and `i` is the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to the current value of `x` at the start of each iteration.

In simpler terms, `mx` will hold the maximum length of the subsequence found during the loop's iterations, `x` will be reduced to 0 after all iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain a list of lengths of subsequences found, and `i` will be the highest power of 2 that fits into the current value of `x` at the beginning of each iteration.
