Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The solution should either print the array or `-1` if no such array exists.
2. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the case when `x` is 2 by printing `[0]`.
   - For other values of `x`, it attempts to decompose `x` into powers of 2.
   - It constructs an array `ansv` based on the decomposition of `x` into powers of 2.
   - The constructed array `ansv` should have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - However, the logic for constructing the array does not fully align with the requirement to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The current approach constructs an array based on the decomposition of `x` into powers of 2, but it does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The construction logic may produce arrays that do not meet the exact count requirement of `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `x = 5`, the code constructs `[0, 1]` which has more than 5 increasing subsequences (specifically, 6: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 1, 1]).
   - For `x = 13`, the code constructs `[0, 1, 2]` which has more than 13 increasing subsequences (specifically, 14: [], [0], [1], [2], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 1, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2]).
   - For `x = 37`, the code constructs `[0, 1, 2, 3]` which has more than 37 increasing subsequences (specifically, 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 63).

Given these observations, the current implementation does not correctly ensure that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **False**
