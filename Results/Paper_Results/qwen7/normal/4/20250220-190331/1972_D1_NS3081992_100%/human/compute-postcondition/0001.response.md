Output State: **`func_15()` returns a positive integer**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_15()` to the standard output after converting it to a string. Since `func_15()` must return a positive integer according to the initial state, the output state is that `func_15()` returns a positive integer. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
