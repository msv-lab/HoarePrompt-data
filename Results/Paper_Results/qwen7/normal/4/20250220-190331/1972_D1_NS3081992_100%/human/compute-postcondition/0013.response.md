Output State: `i` is greater than `m` or `i * i > n + i`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all `j` from 2 to the final value of `i` (inclusive).

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will either be greater than `m` or `i * i` will be greater than `n + i`. The variable `n` remains a positive integer, and `m` remains a positive integer. The variable `ans` contains the cumulative sum of the expression `(n + j) // (j * j)` for each `j` starting from 2 up to the final value of `i` that satisfies the loop condition.
