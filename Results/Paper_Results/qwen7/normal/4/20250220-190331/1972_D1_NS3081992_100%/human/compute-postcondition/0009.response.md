Functionality: **The function processes an unspecified number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_10()` to determine the number of iterations. Then, for each iteration, it calls `func_15()` to get a positive integer, which is printed to the standard output followed by a newline. After processing all test cases, the standard output contains multiple lines, each with a positive integer generated by `func_15()`, with the number of lines corresponding to the sum of the values returned by `func_10()` across all test cases.**
