Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that all functions together meet the problem description. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \). The provided functions `func_10` and `func_7` can be used to read these inputs correctly. `func_10` reads an integer, and `func_7` reads space-separated integers. Since `func_15` uses `func_7` to read the inputs, this part is handled correctly.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The function `func_15` is designed to solve the problem for a single test case. It calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The logic inside `func_15` seems to be correct based on the problem statement. It iterates through possible values of \( i \) and calculates the number of valid pairs using the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\).

3. **Outputting Results**: The function `func_16` correctly handles the multiple test cases by calling `func_10` to determine the number of test cases and then calling `func_15` for each test case. It prints the results one per line, which matches the required output format.

Given that:
- `func_10` and `func_7` correctly read the inputs.
- `func_15` correctly processes each test case according to the problem statement.
- `func_16` correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results in the required format.

The overall structure and functionality of the program align with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
