You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n and 0 <= m, and k is an integer.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be updated by subtracting `m - a[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1` if `a[j] < m`, and `n` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list `a`. The variable `k` will have been adjusted by subtracting `m - a[j]` for each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `a[j]` is less than `m`. Additionally, the loop would only run if `n` was initially greater than 0.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be updated by subtracting `m - a[j]` for each `j` from `0` to `n-1` if `a[j] < m`, and `n` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to execute, but `k` is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`, and returns either 1 or -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
