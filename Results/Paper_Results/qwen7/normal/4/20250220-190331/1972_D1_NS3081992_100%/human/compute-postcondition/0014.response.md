Output State: **The program returns the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all `j` from 2 to the final value of `i` that satisfies `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`, minus 1.**

This means that the program calculates the sum of the expression `(n + j) // (j * j)` for each `j` starting from 2 up to the largest `i` that satisfies either `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`, and then subtracts 1 from this sum before returning it.
