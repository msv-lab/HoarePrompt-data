Output State: The loop will execute a total number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. For each iteration, `func_15()` will return a positive integer, which will be written to the standard output followed by a newline character. After all iterations, the standard output will contain each positive integer returned by `func_15()` on a new line, with the number of lines being equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.

This means that if `func_10()` returns a value `k`, then the standard output will consist of `k` lines, each containing a positive integer as returned by `func_15()`.
