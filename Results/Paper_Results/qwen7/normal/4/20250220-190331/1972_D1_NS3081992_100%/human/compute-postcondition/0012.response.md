Output State: `i` is greater than `m` or `i * i > n + i`, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all valid `i` from 1 to `m`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will either be greater than `m` or `i * i` will be greater than `n + i`. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each valid `i` starting from 1 up to the last value of `i` that satisfied the loop condition.
