### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_15` attempts to solve the problem but contains significant logical errors. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_15` does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it incorrectly increments a counter based on a loop condition that is unrelated to the problem constraints.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is not relevant to the problem and does not help in finding valid pairs \((a, b)\).
3. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `ans` is incremented without considering the actual pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition.

The proposed corrected version of the solution involves iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This approach is more aligned with the problem requirements and should correctly count the valid pairs.

Given that the original code does not meet the problem requirements and the proposed corrected version addresses the issues, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.
