Output State: **`func_15()` returns a positive integer, `func_10()` returns a positive integer that is one less than the previous value, and sys.stdout writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline.**

In this case, the code does not change the values of `func_15()` or `func_10()`. Instead, it writes the value returned by `func_15()` to the standard output (console) followed by a newline. The values of `func_15()` and `func_10()` remain unchanged from their initial state.
