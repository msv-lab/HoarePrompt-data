Output State: **`t` is an input integer less than N, `s` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `r` is the string `a[x] + a[x]`, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `s`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**

In more detail: The value of `b[x]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `t` remains an input integer less than N, `s` remains a list of integers with at least two elements, `r` remains the string `a[x] + a[x]`, `i` remains the second element of the list `s`, `x` remains the index of `i` in the list `s`, and `x` also remains the index of `i` in the list `b`.
