Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and must be less than N; `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string in the list to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `s`. The initial state of `t` being an input integer and must be less than N remains unchanged.
