Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than `t`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which must be an integer greater than `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the condition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) still holds true.
