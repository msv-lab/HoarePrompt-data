The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `t` and `n` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 500` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`), and calculates and prints a mathematical expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` along with `2 * n`. It then prints two sequences of numbers for each `n` from 1 to `n`, each sequence being a range from `n` down to 1. After processing, the function ensures that `n` is at least 3 and `t` remains unchanged.
