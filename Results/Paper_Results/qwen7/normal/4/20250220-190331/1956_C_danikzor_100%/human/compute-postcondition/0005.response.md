Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `i` is 1

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains the same because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same, but since it must still be at least 1, this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
