### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- There are two types of operations:
  1. Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
  2. Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.
- The maximum sum is achieved by setting the diagonal elements to the highest possible values and ensuring the off-diagonal elements are set appropriately.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
- It then prints a value calculated by the formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
- It performs two operations for each \( n \) from 1 to \( n \):
  - For Type 1 operation: Sets the \( i \)-th row to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - For Type 2 operation: Sets the \( i \)-th column to the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` processes a single test case.
- It calculates and prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
- It then performs the specified operations on each row and column.

#### Evaluation:
- The formula \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) is not derived from the problem statement. This formula does not represent the maximum sum of the matrix.
- The operations performed (setting rows and columns to permutations of descending integers) do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. The problem requires maximizing the sum, not just setting elements to specific permutations.

#### Counterexample:
- Consider a 2x2 matrix:
  - Expected maximum sum: 8 (by setting the diagonal to 2 and off-diagonal to 1).
  - Actual output sum: 7 (as per the given program).

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula and does not ensure the sum of the matrix is maximized.
