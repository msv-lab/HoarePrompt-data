Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\), and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is determined by user input and must be an integer between 1 and 500.
2. The expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` calculates a specific mathematical formula involving `n`.
3. The expression `2 * n` simply doubles the value of `n`.

Given these points, the output will consist of two parts separated by a space:
- The first part is the result of the mathematical formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
- The second part is `2 * n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we represent it symbolically in the output.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n**
