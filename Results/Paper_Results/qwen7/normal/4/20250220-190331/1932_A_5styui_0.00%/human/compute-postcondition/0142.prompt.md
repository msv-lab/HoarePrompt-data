Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is an input string, `s` is 0, `i` is `i_final + len(input string) + 1`, `d` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is `len(input string)`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` is a list of characters. If the element at index `j` is '@', then `s` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the list `b` is empty or the element at index `j` is neither '@' nor '*', we ensure that `b[:j+1]` is False, and if `b[j + 1]` is a '*', we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` is a list of characters, `j` is 3, and `s` is incremented by 1. If the element at index 4 in list `b` is '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index 4 is not '*', the function continues without any change to the list `b` or the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` is a list of characters, `j` is 4, and `s` is incremented by 1. If `b[5]` (i.e., `b[j + 1]`) is equal to '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[5]` is not '*', `j` remains 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
