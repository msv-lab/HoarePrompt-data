Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `b` is '@', `s` is an integer incremented by 1.**

The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` was not initialized before this line, it is treated as an integer. The value of `b` and its character at index `j` remain unchanged.
