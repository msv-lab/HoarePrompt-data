Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `j`, `b`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for j in range(len(b)):` will execute as long as `len(b)` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `j` will take values from 0 to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `b`, we need to ensure that `b` is a non-empty string (i.e., `len(b) > 0`).
   - The variable `j` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its initial value is not specified in the loop head.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `a` is an input integer
- `s` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `d` is an input integer
- `b` is an input string

We need to adjust the state of `b` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, `i`, `d`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`b` is a non-empty string**
