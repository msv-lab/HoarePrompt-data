Output State: **`b` is a list of characters, `j` is 4, `s` is `s` + 1**

Explanation: The code `s = s + 1` attempts to increment the value of `s` by 1. However, there is no initial value given for `s` in the initial state, and since no value is provided, `s` remains unchanged from its undefined state. The other variables (`b` and `j`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `s` is now `s` + 1, indicating that `s` has been incremented by 1.
