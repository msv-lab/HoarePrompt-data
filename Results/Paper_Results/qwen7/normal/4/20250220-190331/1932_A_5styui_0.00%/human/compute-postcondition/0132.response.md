Output State: **`b` is a list of characters, `j` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `b` or `j`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was provided, the values remain unchanged.
