You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.')
def func():
    a = int(input())
    s = 0
    for i in range(a):
        d = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if b[j] == '@':
                s = s + 1
            elif b[j] == '*':
                if b[:]:
                    break
                elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                    break
        
        print(s)
        
        s = 0
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `s` will be the total count of '@' characters across all strings `b` provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be the sum of the lengths of all strings `b`, `d` will retain the value it had before the loop started (as it is not used within the loop), `a` will remain unchanged, and `j` will be the length of the last string `b` processed. The loop will break if it encounters two consecutive '*' characters in any string `b`.
    #
    #This means that `s` accumulates the count of '@' symbols from all inputs, while `i` keeps track of the cumulative length of all strings `b`. The variables `d` and `a` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through standard input. It reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. The function then returns a series of outputs, one for each test case, indicating the result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
