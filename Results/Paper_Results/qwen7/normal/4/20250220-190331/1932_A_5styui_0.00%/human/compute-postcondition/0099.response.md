Output State: **`b` is a list of elements, where the element at index `j` is equal to '@', `s` is `s + 1`**.

In this case, the code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1, but the initial state does not specify the exact value of `s`. Therefore, the updated value of `s` is `s + 1`. The list `b` and its element at index `j` remain unchanged.
