Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` if `i` does not equal `L[cur]`.**

Explanation: The code `i -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously defined as `L[-1] - 1`, after this operation, `i` becomes `L[-1] - 2`. The initial state also mentioned that `nums_left` is decreased by 1, so after this operation, `nums_left` is decreased by another 1, making it decreased by 2 in total. The condition for updating `ans` remains the same: if `i` equals `L[cur]`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
