Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `ans` is the original `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `nums_left` is decreased by 2, and `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`. The initial conditions that `nums_left` was decreased by 2 and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2 remain valid. The value of `ans` is updated based on its original value and the new value of `nums_left`.
