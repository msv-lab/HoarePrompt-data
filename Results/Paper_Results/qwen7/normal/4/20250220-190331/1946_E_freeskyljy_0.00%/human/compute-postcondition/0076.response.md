Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 4`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`, `i` is `R[1] + 3`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` becomes either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and `cur` remains either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially `N - R[0] - 3`, after decrementing, it becomes `N - R[0] - 4`. All other variables (`ans`, `cur`, `i`) remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.
