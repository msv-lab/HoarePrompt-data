Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `ans` is updated to the original `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` if the `else` part is executed. If the `if` part is executed, `cur` is `cur - 1`.**

This means that the value of `nums_left` has been decreased by 1 again (making it decreased by 2 from its initial state), and `i` has been decreased by 1 again (making it `L[-1] - 2`). The value of `ans` will be updated based on the conditions given, but the exact value depends on whether the `if` or `else` part is executed. If the `if` part is executed, `cur` will be decremented by 1.
