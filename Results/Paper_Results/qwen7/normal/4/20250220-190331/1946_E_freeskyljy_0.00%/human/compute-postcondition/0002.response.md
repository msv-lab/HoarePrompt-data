Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `R`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, and `L` remain unchanged from their initial states.
