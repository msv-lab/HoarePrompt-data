Reasoning:
1. The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all edge cases.
   - The logic for calculating the number of permutations is incomplete and incorrect.
   - The final result is not fully computed based on the given problem constraints.

2. Let's break down the main parts of the program:
   - It reads `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` from the input.
   - It checks several conditions to ensure that the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with the properties of a permutation.
   - If the conditions are not met, it returns 0.
   - It calculates a combination value using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and modifies it based on the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums.

3. However, the logic for modifying the combination value `ans` is flawed. Specifically:
   - The program only considers the last element of `L` and `R` without properly accounting for the positions of other prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The iteration through `L` and `R` to modify `ans` is incorrect and does not follow the problem's requirements.

4. Given the execution summary, it seems that the program does not fully implement the solution and returns 0 in many cases, which is not aligned with the expected behavior.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to account for the full set of conditions and the proper calculation of the number of permutations.
