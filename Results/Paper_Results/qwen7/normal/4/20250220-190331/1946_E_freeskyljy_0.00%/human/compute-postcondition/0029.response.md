Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2, if `i` equals `L[cur]`, the condition remains unchanged, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.**

This means that `nums_left` has been decreased by 1, while the conditions for `i` and `L[-1]` remain the same. Additionally, the condition for updating `ans` also remains unchanged based on the comparison between `i` and `L[cur]`.
