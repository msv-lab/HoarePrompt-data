Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split using `map(int, input().split())`, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, and either `M1 <= 1` or `M2 <= 1` or `L[-2] != R[1]`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD` if `i` does not equal `L[cur]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, and `ans` is updated to the original `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` if the `else` part is executed. If the `if` part is executed, `cur` is `cur - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, and `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration with `L[-1]` being greater than 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
