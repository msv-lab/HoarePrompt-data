Output State: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - (R.length - 1)`, `cur` is `R[0] + R.length`, `i` is `R[R.length - 1] + 1`, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be one more than the last element in the `R` array, which is `R[R.length - 1] + 1`. Since the loop continues until `i` is less than `N`, once `i` reaches `N`, the loop terminates. At this point, `nums_left` will be reduced by one for each iteration, starting from `N - R[0] - 1` down to `N - R[0] - (R.length - 1)`. The variable `cur` will increment each time `i` equals `R[cur]`, and it will reach `R[0] + R.length` after all iterations. Additionally, since `i` will be `R[R.length - 1] + 1` and will no longer be less than `N`, it will not enter the loop again, ensuring that `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`. The value of `ans` remains 0 because it is only modified when `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, and in all cases where `i` equals `R[cur]`, `ans` is not updated.
