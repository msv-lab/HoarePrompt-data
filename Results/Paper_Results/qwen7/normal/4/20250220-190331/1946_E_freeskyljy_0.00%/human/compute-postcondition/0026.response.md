Output State: **`ans` is `ans * nums_left % MOD`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, `L[-1]` must be greater than 2, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of `i` and `L[-1]` remain unchanged, and the condition that `i` is not equal to `L[cur]` is still valid.
