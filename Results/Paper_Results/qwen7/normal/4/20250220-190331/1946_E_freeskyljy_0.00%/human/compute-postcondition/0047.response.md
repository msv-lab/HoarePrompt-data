Postcondition: **`ans` is 0, regardless of the value of `M1`.** 

Explanation: If `M1 > 1`, the loop runs until `i` is 0, decrementing `nums_left` by 2 in each iteration. Since `nums_left` starts as `L[-1] - 1` and is always decremented by 2, it will eventually become 0. Once `nums_left` is 0, the multiplication inside the loop body no longer affects `ans`, making `ans` 0. If `M1 <= 1`, there is no else part, and the value of `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. However, the condition `M1 > 1` ensures that `ans` becomes 0.
