Output State: **`ans` is `ans * (nums_left) % MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `cur` is 1, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, `N` must be greater than `R[0] + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. The other variables (`nums_left`, `cur`, `i`, and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
