Postcondition: `nums_left` is decreased by either 2 or 3 depending on whether `i` equals `L[cur]`. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `nums_left` is decreased by 3, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, and `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration with `L[-1]` being greater than 3. If `i` does not equal `L[cur]`, then `nums_left` is decreased by 2, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left % MOD)`, and `i` is `L[-1] - 2` with `L[-1]` still being greater than 3.
