Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`, `i` is `R[1] + 2`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` was either `R[0] + 2` or `R[1] + 1`. Since `i` is not equal to `R[cur]` and `R[1] + 1 < N`, `i` must have been `R[0] + 2` initially (because if it was `R[1] + 1`, incrementing it would make it `R[1] + 2`, which is not allowed since `i` cannot be equal to `R[cur]`). After incrementing, `i` becomes `R[1] + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
