Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `cur` is `R[0] + 3`, `i` is either `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cur` was either `R[0] + 2` or 1. After incrementing, `cur` becomes `R[0] + 3` (since adding 1 to `R[0] + 2` gives `R[0] + 3`). All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
