Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, and `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration with `L[-1]` being greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `i -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to `L[-1] - 2`. After decrementing, `i` becomes `L[-1] - 3`. The other variables (`nums_left` and `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for updating `ans` based on the loop iteration with `L[-1]` being greater than 3 remains valid.
