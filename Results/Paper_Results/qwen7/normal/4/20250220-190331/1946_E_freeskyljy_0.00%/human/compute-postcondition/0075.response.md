Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`, `i` is `R[1] + 3`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` becomes either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and `cur` remains either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`.
