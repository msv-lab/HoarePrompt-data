Output State: **`ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 3` or `R[0] + 2`, `i` is either `R[1] + 1` or `R[0] + 2`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N.**

Explanation: The line `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially `N - R[0] - 2`, after decrementing, its new value becomes `N - R[0] - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
