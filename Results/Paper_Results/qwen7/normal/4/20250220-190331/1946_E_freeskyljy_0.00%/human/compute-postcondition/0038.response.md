Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `nums_left` has been decreased by 2.
   - `i` is set to `L[-1] - 2`.
   - `ans` is updated based on the execution of the `else` part (multiplying by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`) or the `if` part (subtracting 1 from `cur`).

3. **Analyze the loop head variables**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than 1.
   - Given that `i` is set to `L[-1] - 2`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 2 > 1` for the loop to execute again.

5. **Calculate the required state**:
   - To satisfy the condition `i > 1`, we need `L[-1] - 2 > 1`.
   - This simplifies to `L[-1] > 3`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `L[-1]` to ensure it is greater than 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 2, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, `ans` is updated based on the loop iteration, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 3**.
