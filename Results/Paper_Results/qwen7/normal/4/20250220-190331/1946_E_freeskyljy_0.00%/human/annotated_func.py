        #
        #Explanation: After the loop runs until `i` is 0, `nums_left` will be 0 because it is decremented by 2 in each iteration and starts from `L[-1] - 1`. Since `nums_left` is 0, the multiplication inside the loop body no longer affects `ans`. Therefore, `ans` becomes 0 after all iterations.

            i += 1
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - (N - R[0]) - 1`, `cur` is `R[0] + (N - R[0])`, `i` is `N`.
        #
        #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `N` because it starts from `R[0] + 1` and increments by 1 until it reaches `N`. For each iteration, `nums_left` decreases by 1, so after `N - R[0] - 1` iterations, `nums_left` will be `N - R[0] - (N - R[0]) - 1`. The value of `cur` will be `R[0] + (N - R[0])` because it increments by 1 for each iteration unless `i` equals `R[cur]`, but since `i` will eventually reach `N`, `cur` will not increment any further. `ans` remains 0 as there is no condition within the loop that changes its value from 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `-1`, `cur` is `N`, `i` is `N`. 
    #
    #Explanation: Given the initial state where `ans` is 0 and `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, the if statement checks if `M2 > 1`. If true, the loop runs until `i` becomes `N`, decrementing `nums_left` and incrementing `cur` and `i` accordingly. Since `i` starts from `R[0] + 1` and goes up to `N`, `nums_left` will be decremented by `N - R[0] - 1` iterations, resulting in `nums_left` becoming `-1`. The value of `cur` will be `N` because it increments by 1 for each iteration and does not change once `i` reaches `N`. The value of `i` will also be `N` after the loop completes. `ans` remains 0 as there is no condition within the loop that changes its value.
    return ans
    #The program returns 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` and checks several conditions. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a combination value based on `N` and the last element of `L`. It then iterates through `L` and `R` to modify the combination value `ans` under certain conditions. Finally, the function returns 0.
