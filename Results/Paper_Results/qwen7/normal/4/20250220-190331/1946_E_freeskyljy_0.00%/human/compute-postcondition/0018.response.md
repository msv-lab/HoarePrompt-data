Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers obtained from the input split, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split using `map(int, input().split())`, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, and either `M1 <= 1` or `M2 <= 1` or `L[-2] != R[1]`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = M1 - 2` assigns the value of `M1 - 2` to the variable `cur`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, and the conditions related to `L` and `R` remain unchanged.
