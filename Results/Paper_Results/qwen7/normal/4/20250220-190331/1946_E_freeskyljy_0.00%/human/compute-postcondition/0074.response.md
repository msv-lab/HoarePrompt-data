Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `cur` is either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`, `i` is `R[1] + 3`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `R[1] + 1 < N. This is because if `i` equals `R[cur]`, `ans` and `cur` are updated accordingly, and if `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, `ans` remains 0 and `cur` is updated to either `R[0] + 4` or `R[0] + 3`.
