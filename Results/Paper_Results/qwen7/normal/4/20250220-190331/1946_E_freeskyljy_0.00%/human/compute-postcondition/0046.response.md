Output State: `nums_left` is 0, `i` is 0, and `ans` is the result of multiplying `ans` by `nums_left` (which is 0) modulo `MOD` for the remaining iterations, which effectively makes `ans` 0 since any number multiplied by 0 is 0.

Explanation: After the loop runs until `i` is 0, `nums_left` will be 0 because it is decremented by 2 in each iteration and starts from `L[-1] - 1`. Since `nums_left` is 0, the multiplication inside the loop body no longer affects `ans`. Therefore, `ans` becomes 0 after all iterations.
