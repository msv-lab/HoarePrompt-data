Output State: **`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user, `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `x` and `l` are unchanged.**

This means that the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` retain their initial values as integers inputted by the user. The variable `t` must still be greater than 0. The variable `x` is now set to the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2. The variable `l` remains unchanged.
