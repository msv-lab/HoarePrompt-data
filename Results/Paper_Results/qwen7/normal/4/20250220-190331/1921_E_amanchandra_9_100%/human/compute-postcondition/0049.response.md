Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six positive integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it checks if \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) are different or \(y_a\) and \(y_b\) are different. If the conditions are met, it calculates whether Alice or Bob wins based on their positions. The function prints 'Draw' if \(a > c\), otherwise it determines the winner based on the relative positions of the calculated ranges. The function does not return any value but prints the outcome for each test case.**
