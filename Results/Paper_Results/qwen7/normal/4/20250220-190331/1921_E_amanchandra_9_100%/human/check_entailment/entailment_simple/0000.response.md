### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided function step-by-step to determine if it correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the rules and constraints given.

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Game Outcome Determination:**
   - The function checks if `a > c` (i.e., Alice's row position is greater than Bob's row position).
     - If `a > c`, it prints "Draw". This is because if Alice is in a higher row than Bob, Alice cannot reach Bob's row before Bob can move away, thus making it impossible for Alice to win.
     - Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the possible moves and determine the winner.

3. **Calculating Moves:**
   - It calculates the difference in row positions (`x = abs(a - c)`).
   - Depending on whether this difference is odd or even, it adjusts the left (`l`) and right (`r`) boundaries for Bob's possible moves.
   - It then checks if Bob's column position (`b`) is within these boundaries (`l` and `r`).

4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the difference in row positions is odd, it checks if Bob's column position is within `x + 1` distance from the boundaries.
   - If the difference in row positions is even, it checks if Alice's column position is within `x` distance from the boundaries.

5. **Output:**
   - Based on the above conditions, it prints "Alice" or "Bob" if a winning condition is met, otherwise it prints "Draw".

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Case `a > c`:**
  - The function correctly identifies that if Alice is in a higher row than Bob, she cannot win, so it prints "Draw".
  - This part of the logic is correct.

- **Case `a <= c`:**
  - The function correctly calculates the possible moves for Bob and Alice.
  - It checks if Bob can force a draw or win by being within the calculated boundaries.
  - The logic for checking the boundaries and determining the winner is correct.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided function correctly implements the game rules and logic to determine the outcome of the game for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program accurately reflects the logic and correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
