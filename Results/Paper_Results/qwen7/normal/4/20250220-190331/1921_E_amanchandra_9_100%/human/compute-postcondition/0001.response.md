State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and t is greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable when the index itself is not needed within the loop body.
- The loop condition `range(t)` requires that `t` is a positive integer.
- Since `t` is given as an input integer and the range is specified as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` meets these conditions.
- Therefore, the state must include that `t` is an integer within the specified range and greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
