Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` will be updated according to the conditions inside the loop for each iteration. Specifically, `r` and `w` will be adjusted based on the comparison between `a` and `c`, and the values of `x`, `l`, `b`, and `d`. The variable `t` will be decremented with each iteration until it reaches 0. The final values of `r` and `w` will be the minimum of `w` and the adjusted values based on the conditions in the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` will reflect the last set of calculations performed within the loop for the final iteration. If `a > c`, the outcome will always be 'Draw'. Otherwise, the outcome will depend on the relative positions of `l`, `b`, and `r` compared to `d` and `x`.

The exact final values of `r` and `w` cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each iteration, but they will be the result of the loop's logic applied to each set of inputs.
