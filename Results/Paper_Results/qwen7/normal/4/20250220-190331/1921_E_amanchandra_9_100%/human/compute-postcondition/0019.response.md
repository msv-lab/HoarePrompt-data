Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive, and greater than 0; `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true) or `b + x` (if `abs(a - c) % 2` is false); `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` retain their original values; `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true) or `b - x` (if `abs(a - c) % 2` is false).
