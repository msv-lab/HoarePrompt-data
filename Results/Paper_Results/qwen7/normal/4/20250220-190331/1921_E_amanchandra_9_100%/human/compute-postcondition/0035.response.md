Based on the initial state provided:

- `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers inputted from the user.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `x` and `l` are unchanged (though their values are not specified, they do not affect the print statement).

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **'Draw'**
