Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive, and greater than 0; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split; `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2; `abs(a - c) % 2` is equal to 0; `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

This means that the variable `l` is assigned the value of the maximum between 1 and the result of `b - x`. Given that `x` is defined as `abs(a - c) / 2` and `abs(a - c) % 2` is equal to 0, `x` is an integer, and `b - x` will also be an integer. The value of `l` will be 1 if `b - x` is less than 1, otherwise, it will be `b - x`.
