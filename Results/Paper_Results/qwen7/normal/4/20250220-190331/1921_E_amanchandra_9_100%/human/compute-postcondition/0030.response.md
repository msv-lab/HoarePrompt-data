Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w`, `b`, `a`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` retain their original values.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
   ```

3. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the square brackets `[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x]` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
   - If `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is `True`, then the list `['Draw']` is selected.
   - If `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` is `False`, then the list `['Bob']` is selected.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the selected list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

4. **Evaluating the Condition:**
   - We need to know the values of `l`, `d`, `x`, and `r` to evaluate the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.
   - Since the values of `l`, `d`, `x`, and `r` are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact outcome of the condition. However, based on the structure, the print statement will output either `'Draw'` or `'Bob'`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since we cannot determine the exact values of `l`, `d`, `x`, and `r`, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the condition.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Bob'] depending on the values of l, d, x, and r**
