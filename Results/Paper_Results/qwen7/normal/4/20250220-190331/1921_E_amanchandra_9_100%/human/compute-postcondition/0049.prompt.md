You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. Additionally, the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` will be updated according to the conditions inside the loop for each iteration. Specifically, `r` and `w` will be adjusted based on the comparison between `a` and `c`, and the values of `x`, `l`, `b`, and `d`. The variable `t` will be decremented with each iteration until it reaches 0. The final values of `r` and `w` will be the minimum of `w` and the adjusted values based on the conditions in the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` will reflect the last set of calculations performed within the loop for the final iteration. If `a > c`, the outcome will always be 'Draw'. Otherwise, the outcome will depend on the relative positions of `l`, `b`, and `r` compared to `d` and `x`.
    #
    #The exact final values of `r` and `w` cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each iteration, but they will be the result of the loop's logic applied to each set of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. It checks if the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9 are met, and ensures that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. If these conditions are satisfied, the function does not return anything explicitly; otherwise, it indicates an invalid input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
