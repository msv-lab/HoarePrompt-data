You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` will be updated according to the conditions inside the loop for each iteration. Specifically, `r` and `w` will be adjusted based on the comparison between `a` and `c`, and the values of `x`, `l`, `b`, and `d`. The variable `t` will be decremented with each iteration until it reaches 0. The final values of `r` and `w` will be the minimum of `w` and the adjusted values based on the conditions in the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` will reflect the last set of calculations performed within the loop for the final iteration. If `a > c`, the outcome will always be 'Draw'. Otherwise, the outcome will depend on the relative positions of `l`, `b`, and `r` compared to `d` and `x`.
    #
    #The exact final values of `r` and `w` cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each iteration, but they will be the result of the loop's logic applied to each set of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six positive integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it checks if \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) are different or \(y_a\) and \(y_b\) are different. If the conditions are met, it calculates whether Alice or Bob wins based on their positions. The function prints 'Draw' if \(a > c\), otherwise it determines the winner based on the relative positions of the calculated ranges. The function does not return any value but prints the outcome for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `r` (height), `w` (width), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` respectively.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if Alice's row position `a` is greater than Bob's row position `c`. 
     - If `a > c`, it prints "Draw". This part is correct because if Alice is already in a higher row than Bob, neither can capture the other since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up.

3. **Case When Alice is Not in a Higher Row:**
   - If `a <= c`, the program calculates the difference in rows `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - It then checks if this difference is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`).

4. **Odd Difference Case:**
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the possible left and right boundaries for Alice's next move.
   - `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`.
   - It then checks if Bob's column position `b` is within these boundaries.
   - If `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`, it prints "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

5. **Even Difference Case:**
   - If the difference is even, it calculates similar boundaries but for Bob's next move.
   - `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`.
   - It then checks if Alice's column position `a` is within these boundaries.
   - If `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Verification Against Examples:
The provided examples show various scenarios where the program's logic should work correctly:
- Alice and Bob in different rows with an odd difference (Alice wins).
- Alice and Bob in different rows with an even difference (Bob wins).
- Alice and Bob in the same row (Draw).

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to correctly implement the rules and outcomes as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both players.
