Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[4 % x] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[3] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0`. If `gap` is not greater than 0, `gaps` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `gap` to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, which is equivalent to `next_elem - a[3] - 1` since `i` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
