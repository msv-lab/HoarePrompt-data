Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` must be a positive integer.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration `i` becomes 1, after the second iteration `i` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x`. Given that `i` is now 2, `x` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `x` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (since the loop condition is based on `i < x`).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be a positive integer greater than 2, `next_elem` is `a[3 % x] + n`, `gap` is `a[3 % x] + n - a[2] - 1`, `gaps` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0`. If `gap` is not greater than 0, `gaps` remains unchanged.**
