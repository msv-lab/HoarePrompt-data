Postcondition: `pairs` is equal to the next `gap // 2`, `y` is either decreased by `pairs` or retains its previous value, and `ans` is either increased by `gap` or retains its previous value, depending on whether `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, `y` is decreased by `pairs` and `ans` is increased by `gap`. Otherwise, `y` retains its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
