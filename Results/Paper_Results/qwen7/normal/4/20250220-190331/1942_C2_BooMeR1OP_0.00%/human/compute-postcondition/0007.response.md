Output State: **`i` is 0; `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(a[i] + 1) % n` to `t1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `t1` is calculated as `(a[0] + 1) % n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables remain in their initial state as no other variables are involved in the operation.
