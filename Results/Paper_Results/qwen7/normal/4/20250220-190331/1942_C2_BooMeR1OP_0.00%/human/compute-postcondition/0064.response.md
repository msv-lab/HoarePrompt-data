Output State: **`pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` retains its previous value, `ans` is increased by 2 * `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `pairs`, `y`, or `ans`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement.
