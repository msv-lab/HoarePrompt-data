Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is an integer between 0 and n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, n, x, and y are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state but not used in the given code snippet. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned the values from the input split into integers according to the specified conditions.
