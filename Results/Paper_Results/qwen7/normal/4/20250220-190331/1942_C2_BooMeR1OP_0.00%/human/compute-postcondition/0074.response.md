Postcondition: `pairs` is equal to the next `gap // 2`, `y` is either decreased by `pairs` or retains its previous value, and `ans` is increased by `gap` if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, `y` retains its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
