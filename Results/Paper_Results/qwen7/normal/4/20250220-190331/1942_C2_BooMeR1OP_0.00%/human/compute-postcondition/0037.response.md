Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` must be a positive integer; `next_elem` is `a[3 % x] + n`; `gap` is `a[3 % x] + n - a[2] - 1`; `gaps` is a list containing one element which is `gap`.**

Explanation: The line `gaps.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. Since `gaps` was initially empty, after appending `gap`, `gaps` now contains one element, which is `gap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
