Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `x`, `next_elem` is `a[x % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i-1] - 1` if `gap` is positive, and `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive `gap` values calculated during each iteration where `gap > 0`.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is adjusted based on the condition: if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `y` is reduced by `pairs` and `ans` is increased by `gap`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `2 * y` and `pairs` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` retains its previous value, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `ans` is equal to `ans + gap`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `pairs` is equal to the next `gap // 2`, `y` is either decreased by `pairs` or retains its previous value, and `ans` is increased by `gap` if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, `y` retains its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
