Postcondition: `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is adjusted based on the condition: if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `y` is reduced by `pairs` and `ans` is increased by `gap`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `2 * y` and `pairs` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
