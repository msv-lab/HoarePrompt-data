Output State: **`pairs` is equal to the next `gap // 2`, `y` retains its previous value, and `ans` retains its previous value**

Explanation: The code `pairs = gap // 2` updates the value of `pairs` to be the integer division of `gap` by 2. The values of `y` and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states.
