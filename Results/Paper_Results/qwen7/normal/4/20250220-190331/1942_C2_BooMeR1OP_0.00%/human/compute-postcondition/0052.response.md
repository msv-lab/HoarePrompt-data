Output State: **`pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is equal to `y - pairs`, `ans` is increased by `gap`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by the value of `pairs`. Since `pairs` is equal to `gap // 2`, `y` is now `y - (gap // 2)`. The values of `pairs` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
