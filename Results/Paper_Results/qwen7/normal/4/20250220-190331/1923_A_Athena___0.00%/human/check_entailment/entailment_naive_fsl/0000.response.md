Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The program attempts to remove leading and trailing zeros but does not actually simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate this:

Consider the input:
```
4
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `1`, as explained in the example. However, the current implementation does not account for the actual movement of chips. It simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, which does not reflect the minimum number of operations needed.

To illustrate, let's manually walk through the steps for the above input:
1. Initial state: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
2. Remove leading zero: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
3. Remove trailing zero: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
4. Count remaining zeros: `3`

However, the actual minimum operations required are:
1. Move the chip in the 5th position to the 4th position: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
