Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`. This means the loop continues as long as the list `a` is not empty and the last element of `a` is 0.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `res` is 0 (this state is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is an input integer (this state is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `a` is a list with the last element being a value other than 0.
   - `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop (this state is not directly relevant to the loop condition).

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**: For the loop to continue, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
   - `a` should not be empty (`a` should still exist).
   - The last element of `a` should be 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `a` is a list and its last element was not 0, it means `a` was not empty at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, `a` must still be non-empty for the loop to continue.
   - However, since the last element of `a` was not 0, the loop would have exited because the condition `a[-1] == 0` would have been false. To make the loop continue, the last element of `a` must become 0.

5. **Final State**:
   - `res` remains 0.
   - `n` remains an input integer.
   - `a` must be a non-empty list, and its last element must be 0.
   - `i` is the index of the last iteration, but it doesn't affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the last element of the list `a` to be 0.

**State**: **`res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its last element must be 0**
