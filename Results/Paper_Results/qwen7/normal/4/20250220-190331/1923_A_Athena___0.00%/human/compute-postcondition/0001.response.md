State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, so `t` must also be less than or equal to 1000.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since there are no other variables mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
