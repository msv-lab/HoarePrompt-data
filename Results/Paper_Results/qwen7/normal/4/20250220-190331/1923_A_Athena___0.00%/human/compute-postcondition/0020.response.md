Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either an empty list or a list without any leading zeros, `res` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `a` will no longer have any leading zeros. If there were leading zeros, they would have been removed by the loop. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as does `n` and `res`, since the loop only modifies the list `a`.
