Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain its last element which is 0, `res` is 0**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from list `a`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` remains an input integer, and `res` remains 0.
