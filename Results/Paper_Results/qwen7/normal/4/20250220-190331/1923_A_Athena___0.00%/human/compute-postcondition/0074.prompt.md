Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with all elements that were 0 removed, `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have had all its leading zeros removed. The variable `res` remains 0 because it is not modified by the loop. The variable `i` will be the index of the last iteration of the loop, which is the position of the last remaining element in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is 1, `i` is 0, and `len(a)` is the length of the original list `a` with all leading zeros removed, assuming the current value of `a[i]` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is not 0, then `res` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `len(a)` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and this holds true if and only if the element at index `i` in the list `a` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is 3, `i` is 2, and the length of list `a` must be greater than 2. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is 0, then `res` is set to 3. Otherwise, `res` and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
