Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues with the next statement or loop. If the sum is even, the program does not enter the if block.
