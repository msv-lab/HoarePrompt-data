Postcondition: **`x` is either 0 or 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, and `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1.**
