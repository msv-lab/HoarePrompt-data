Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `x` is 0, and `y` is 1.**

The code sets `x` to 0, which changes the value of `x` from its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged according to their preconditions.
