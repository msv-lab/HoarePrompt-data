Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) is even. If not, it correctly prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This check is necessary because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules.
3. **Direct Comparison**: If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the function prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). This condition is valid because if the highest score is at least as high as the sum of the other two scores, it implies a scenario where the maximum number of draws could have occurred without violating the constraints.
4. **Adjustment Loop**: In the case where \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), the function uses a loop to adjust \( x \) and \( y \) to find a valid solution. The logic inside the loop ensures that the differences between the scores are adjusted such that the number of draws is maximized. The loop continues until it finds a valid combination or determines that no valid combination exists.

Given the detailed analysis of the code and the execution summary, the function appears to handle all the conditions and constraints correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
