State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head that affects whether the loop can execute. It must be an integer within the specified range (1 to 500) for the loop to start.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used as the loop variable, typically representing the iteration number. By the time the loop starts, `_` should be set to 1.

Since the loop body is omitted, no other states need adjustment.
