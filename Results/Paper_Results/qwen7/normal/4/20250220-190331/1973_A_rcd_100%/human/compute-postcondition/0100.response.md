Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
   - `_` is 3.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even.
   - `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - `p3` is at least 3.
   - `x` remains 0.
   - `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(p1 - x + p3)
   ```

Given the constraints:
- Since `x` remains 0, the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3`.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. This means that either all three numbers are even, or one is even and two are odd.
- `p3` is at least 3, so it can be any integer from 3 to some upper limit that keeps the sum even.
- `p1` and `p2` must be chosen such that their sum with `p3` is even.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `p1 + p3`.

Output: **p1 + p3**
