Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `_` is 3, after decrementing, its value becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
