Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be evaluated:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, and `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`.
   - The current value of `y` is `p3`.
   - `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `p1 - x + p3`.

Given the values from the initial state:
- `x = 0`.
- `y = p3`.
- The expression simplifies to `p1 - 0 + p3` which is `p1 + p3`.

Since `p1 + p3` is part of the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, and `p3 < p1 + p2`, the values of `p1` and `p3` are such that their sum is even. This means `p1 + p3` is an even number.

However, the exact values of `p1` and `p3` are not specified, but we know they must satisfy the conditions given. Therefore, the expression `p1 + p3` will be an even number.

Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 + p3 is an even number)**
