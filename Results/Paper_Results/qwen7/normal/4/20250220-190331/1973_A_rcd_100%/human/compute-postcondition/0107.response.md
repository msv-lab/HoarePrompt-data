Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
   - `_` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers such that their sum is even.
   - `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - `p3` is at least 3.
   - Either `x` remains 0 with `y` being 0 (if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`), or `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 (if `p1 - x > p2 - y`).

2. **Determine the Values of `x` and `y`:**
   - Since `p3` is at least 3 and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be even, let's consider possible values for `p1` and `p2`:
     - If `p1` and `p2` are both odd, then `p3` must be even to make the sum even.
     - If `p1` and `p2` are both even, then `p3` must be even to make the sum even.
     - If one of `p1` or `p2` is odd and the other is even, then `p3` must be odd to make the sum even.
   - Given these conditions, let's assume `p1 = 4`, `p2 = 6`, and `p3 = 2` (these values satisfy the conditions: sum is even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3).
   - Now, we need to determine `x` and `y`:
     - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` is 0.
     - If `p1 - x > p2 - y`, then `x` is 1 and `y` is 0.
   - Let's check the inequality:
     - `p1 - x = 4 - 0 = 4` (since `x` remains 0 initially).
     - `p2 - y = 6 - 0 = 6`.
     - Since `4 <= 6`, `x` remains 0 and `y` is 0.

3. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - x + p3)`.
   - Substituting the values, we get `print(4 - 0 + 2) = print(6)`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **6**
