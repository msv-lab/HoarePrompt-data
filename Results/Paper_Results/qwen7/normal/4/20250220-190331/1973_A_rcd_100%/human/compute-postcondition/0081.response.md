Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The conditions about the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` being less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` being at least 3 remain valid post-execution. The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by the input operation.
