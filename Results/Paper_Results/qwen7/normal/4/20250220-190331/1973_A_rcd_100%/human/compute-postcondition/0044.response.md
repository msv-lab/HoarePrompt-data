Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is explicitly given as 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers whose sum is even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and they are assigned values from the input split and converted to integers.
- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` is explicitly given as 1.

The `print` statement simply outputs `-1` regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **-1**
