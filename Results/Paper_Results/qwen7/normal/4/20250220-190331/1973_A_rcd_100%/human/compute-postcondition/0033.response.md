Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` must be 1.

However, the values of `p1` and `p3` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since these values are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the expression `p1 - x + p3` will remain in its symbolic form.

Given that `x` can be either 0 or 1, the expression `p1 - x + p3` will evaluate to either `p1 + p3` or `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Since we cannot determine the exact values of `p1` and `p3`, the output will be the expression itself.

Output: **p1 - x + p3**
