Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input using `input().split()` and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `_` is still 1. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` depend on the input provided by the user, but they are guaranteed to be integers.
