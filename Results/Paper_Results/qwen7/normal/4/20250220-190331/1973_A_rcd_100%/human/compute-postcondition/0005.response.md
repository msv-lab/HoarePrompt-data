Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input split.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The `print` statement simply outputs `-1`.

Since no other variables or objects are involved in the `print` statement, and the value to be printed is explicitly given, the output is straightforward.

Output: **-1**
