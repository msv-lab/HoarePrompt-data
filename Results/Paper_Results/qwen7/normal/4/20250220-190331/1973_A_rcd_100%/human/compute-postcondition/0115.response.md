Postcondition: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3. The variable `x` is either 0 or 1, and `y` is -1. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y` holds true at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. Otherwise, the loop continues until `y` becomes -1, and it prints `p3` at the end.**
