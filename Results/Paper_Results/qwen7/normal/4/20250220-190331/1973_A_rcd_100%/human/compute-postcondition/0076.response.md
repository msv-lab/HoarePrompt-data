Output State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 2, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `x` is 2, `y` is `p3 - 2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, we know from the given conditions that the loop will continue to decrement `y` and increment `x` until `y` is no longer greater than or equal to `x`. Given that the loop executes up to the third iteration, it implies that `y` was initially set to `p3` and has been decremented twice, resulting in `y` becoming `p3 - 2`. At the same time, `x` has been incremented twice, making it `2`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
