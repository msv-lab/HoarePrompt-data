Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is calculated as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`, and `cost` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input, `k` is the third element of `M`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`, `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, if `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`. The `continue` statement is executed, but it does not change any variable values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
