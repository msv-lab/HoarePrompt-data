Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with given constraints), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It does not return a value directly but processes these inputs according to their constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes specific parameters and a list of integers. The function does not return any value directly from its body but is expected to process these inputs based on the given constraints.
