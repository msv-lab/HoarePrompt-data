Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` is an integer representing the length of list `N`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `cost` as `mu * w`. Here, `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `w` is the last element of `N` before popping. Since the operation does not affect any other variables, their states remain unchanged. The new variable `cost` is introduced with the calculated value.
