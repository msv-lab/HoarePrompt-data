Postcondition: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and `cost` is calculated as follows: if `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
