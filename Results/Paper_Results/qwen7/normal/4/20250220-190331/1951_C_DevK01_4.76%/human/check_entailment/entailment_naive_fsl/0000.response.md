Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a given day affects the price of tickets on subsequent days. Specifically, the program does not account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a given day. Here's an example to illustrate this:

Consider the input:
```
3 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

The correct approach would be:
- On day 1, buy 2 tickets: cost = 2 * 8 = 16, new prices = [16, 10, 8].
- On day 2, buy 1 ticket: cost = 1 * 10 = 10, new prices = [16, 11].
- On day 3, buy 0 tickets: cost = 0.

Total cost = 16 + 10 = 26.

However, the provided program calculates the cost as follows:
- On day 1, buy 2 tickets: cost = 2 * 8 = 16, new prices = [16, 10, 8].
- On day 2, buy 1 ticket: cost = 1 * 10 = 10, new prices = [16, 11].
- On day 3, buy 0 tickets: cost = 0.

Total cost = 16 + 10 = 26.

This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the increase in ticket prices due to the tickets purchased on day 1. The correct total cost should be 26, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 26.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, making it incorrect.
