Output State: **`m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of `N`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of the elements in the list `N`, which contains the first `q` elements of `L`. The value of `q` is determined as the ceiling value of `k / m`. The variables `m`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `q` retain their original values from the initial state, while a new variable `cost` is introduced with the calculated value based on the given formula.
