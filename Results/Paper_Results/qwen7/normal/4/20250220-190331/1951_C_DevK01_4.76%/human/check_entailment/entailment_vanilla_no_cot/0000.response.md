Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ticket Purchases and Price Increases**: The logic for calculating the cost does not correctly account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a given day. Specifically, the code does not properly simulate the price increases for subsequent days.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The current implementation assumes a fixed pattern of buying tickets without considering the dynamic nature of ticket prices. It also does not handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the product of `m` and the number of days (`nm`).

3. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices might not always lead to the optimal solution because the problem requires a strategy to minimize the total cost, which is not straightforwardly solved by sorting alone.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not handle edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought is very large compared to the number of days, or when the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`) is small.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that considers the optimal purchase strategy for each day while accounting for the price increases.

Here's a high-level outline of a potential correct solution:
- Use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum cost to buy a certain number of tickets up to each day.
- Maintain a state that includes the current day and the number of tickets already bought.
- For each day, decide whether to buy tickets or skip based on the cost and the resulting price increase.

This would require a more detailed and complex implementation than the provided solution.
