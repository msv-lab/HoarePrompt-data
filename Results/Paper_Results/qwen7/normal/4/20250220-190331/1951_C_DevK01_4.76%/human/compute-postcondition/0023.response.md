Output State: **`L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `L`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not yet determined, `N` is not yet determined, and `cost` is not yet determined.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `M`. The original list `L` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user, and `M` is now a sorted version of `L`. The lengths of `L` and `M` are the same, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are derived from the elements of `L` (or `M`). The variables `q`, `N`, and `cost` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
