Output State: **`L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not yet determined, `N` is not yet determined, and `cost` is not yet determined.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first, second, and third elements of the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The other variables (`q`, `N`, and `cost`) remain unchanged, and the sorted list `M` remains unaffected as well.
