Let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `cost` step by step:

1. **List `L`:** User-entered list of integers.
2. **List `M`:** Sorted version of `L`.
3. **Variable `n`:** Length of `N`, which is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
4. **Variable `m`:** Minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`.
5. **Variable `k`:** Third element of `L`.
6. **Variable `q`:** Ceiling of `k / m`.
7. **List `N`:** Sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
8. **Variable `cost`:** Calculated based on conditions involving `n`, `m`, `k`, `N`, and `w` (the last element of `N` before popping).

Given the formula for `cost`:
- If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

Since the exact values of `L`, `M`, `N`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `q` are not provided, we need to express the cost in terms of these variables.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `m`:** `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`.
2. **Determine `k`:** `k` is the third element of `L`.
3. **Determine `q`:** `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
4. **Sublist `N`:** `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`.
5. **Calculate `cost`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of the variables are not provided, the output will be expressed in terms of the variables involved in the calculation.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the provided conditions involving n, m, k, N, and w)**
