Output State: **`mu` is equal to `k - (n - 1) * m`, `m` is the first element of `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `L` minus the last element, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, and `n` is the length of `N`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cost` by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
