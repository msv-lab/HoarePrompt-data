To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from user input.
   - `k` is the third element of `M`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `N`.
   - `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`.
   - `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`.

2. **Conditions for Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given these steps, let's analyze the cost calculation more closely:

- Since `N` is a list of the first `q` elements of `M`, and `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` will contain the smallest `q` elements from `M` up to the `q`-th element.
- The value of `m` is the minimum of the second element of `M` and `k`.
- The value of `n` is the length of `N`.

Let's consider the two cases for the cost calculation:

### Case 1: `n * m == k`
- This means that the number of elements in `N` times the value of `m` equals `k`.
- The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.

### Case 2: `n * m != k`
- In this case, `n * m` does not equal `k`.
- The last element of `N` is popped, and `n` is updated to the new length of `N`.
- The value of `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- The cost is updated to include the additional terms: `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given the complexity of the problem, without specific values for `M`, `k`, and `m`, it's challenging to provide a precise numerical answer. However, we can describe the general form of the output:

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions described above)**
