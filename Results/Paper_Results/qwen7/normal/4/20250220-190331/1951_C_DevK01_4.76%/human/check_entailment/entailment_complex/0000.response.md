Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are correctly initialized from the input for each test case.
3. **Sorting**: The list `M` is sorted, which is necessary for the logic that follows.
4. **Calculating Minimum Tickets to Purchase (`q`)**: The variable `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`, which determines how many days' worth of tickets need to be considered.
5. **Sublist Creation (`N`)**: The sublist `N` is created from the first `q` elements of `M`, which is used to calculate the cost.
6. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated directly using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, the cost is split into two parts: the cost for the last batch of tickets and the cost for the rest of the tickets.
7. **Output**: The cost is printed for each test case, and the loop continues to the next test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements. It calculates the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets across `n` days, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased per day and the price increase mechanism.

Correctness: **True**
