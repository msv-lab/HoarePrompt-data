Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is the length of list `N`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `cost` variable by adding the expression `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `cost` is calculated using the updated expression, and `n` remains the length of list `N`.
