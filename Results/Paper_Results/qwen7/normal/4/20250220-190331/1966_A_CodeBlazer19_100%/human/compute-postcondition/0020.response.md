Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers**.

This means that the values of `t`, `i`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged from the initial state. The variables `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers.
