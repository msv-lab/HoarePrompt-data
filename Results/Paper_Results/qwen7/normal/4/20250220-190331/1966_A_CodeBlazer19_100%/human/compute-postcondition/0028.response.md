Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, k, and a list of integers c. It then calculates the count of each unique number in the list c and checks if the maximum count is greater than or equal to k. If true, it prints k - 1; otherwise, it prints n. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the result for each test case.**
