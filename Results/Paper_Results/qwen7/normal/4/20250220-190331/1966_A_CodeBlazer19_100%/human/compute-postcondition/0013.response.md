Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts these parts into integers which are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.
