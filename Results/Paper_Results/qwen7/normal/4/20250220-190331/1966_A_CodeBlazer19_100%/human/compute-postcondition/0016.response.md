Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `p` is a list of counts where each element is the count of a unique element in `l`.
- `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `p` is a list of counts of unique elements in the updated `l`.

The `print(k - 1)` statement will subtract 1 from the value of `k` and print the result.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, the output will be `k - 1`, where `k` is the input integer provided.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the input integer)**
