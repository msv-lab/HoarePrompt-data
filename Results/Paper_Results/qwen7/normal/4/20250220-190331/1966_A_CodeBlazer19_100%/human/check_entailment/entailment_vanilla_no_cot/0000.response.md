Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**: The current implementation checks if the maximum count of any card type (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1` as the result. This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for all possible scenarios where the number of cards can be reduced further through multiple operations.

2. **Handling All Card Types**: The solution only considers the most frequent card type and its count. It should consider all card types and their counts to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution fails to handle edge cases properly. For example, in the case where all cards have different numbers, the current logic will incorrectly print `n`.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that we reduce the number of cards optimally by considering all card types and their counts. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Count the occurrences of each card type
        card_counts = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards that can remain
        min_cards = n
        for count in card_counts:
            # If the count of a card type is divisible by k, we can reduce it to (count // k) * (k - 1)
            if count % k == 0:
                min_cards -= count
            else:
                # Otherwise, we can reduce it to (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)
                min_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)
        
        print(min_cards)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cards that can remain by considering the divisibility of each card count by `k` and adjusting the total accordingly.
