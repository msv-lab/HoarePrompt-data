Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`. Since the if condition `a >= b` is not specified to be true or false, the values of `ans` and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial calculations.**
