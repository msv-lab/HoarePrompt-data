Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a` for the last iteration.**

In this final state, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0 after all the test cases have been processed. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the inputs for the last test case. The variables `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are set based on the conditions and calculations performed in the last iteration of the loop.
