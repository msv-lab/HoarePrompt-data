Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.**

This means that the variable `k` is assigned the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`. The other variables retain their initial conditions.
