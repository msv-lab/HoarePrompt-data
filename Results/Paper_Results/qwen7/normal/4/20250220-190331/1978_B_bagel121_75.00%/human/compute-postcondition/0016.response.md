Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. Here, `k` is already defined as the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
