Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**

Explanation: The given code does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, or `p2`. It only reassigns the value of `ans` using the formula provided. Since the initial state already includes these variables and their relationships, no new information is added about these variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
