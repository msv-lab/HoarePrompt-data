Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is set to `t - 1`. Since `t` is not used in the subsequent calculations, this assignment does not affect the outcome.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `k` is defined as the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Calculating `k`:**
   - `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`
   - Simplifying inside the parentheses: `b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1`
   - So, `ans = int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`

4. **Calculating `p2`:**
   - `p2 = (n - k) * a`

5. **Final Expression:**
   - The print statement is `print(ans + p2)`
   - Substituting the expressions for `ans` and `p2`, we get:
     \[
     \text{print}\left(\text{int}\left(\frac{(2b - k + 1) \cdot k}{2}\right) + (n - k) \cdot a\right)
     \]

Given the above steps, the final output expression is:

Output: **int((2b - k + 1) * k / 2) + (n - k) * a**
