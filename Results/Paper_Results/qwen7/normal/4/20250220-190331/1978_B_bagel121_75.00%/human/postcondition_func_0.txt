The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost based on the given conditions. If the usual price of a bun is greater than or equal to the modified price, it simply prints the total cost as `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost considering the modified price for the first few buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.
