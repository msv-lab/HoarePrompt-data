Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for calculating the maximum profit is correct:
   - If `a >= b`, the profit is simply `n * a` because there's no benefit in using the promotion.
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. This is done by taking the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, which ensures that `k` is within the valid range.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is simply `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.
4. The program handles all given examples correctly and produces the expected outputs.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
