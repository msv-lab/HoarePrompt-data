Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`, `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `k` was previously defined as `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. After executing `k = j + 1`, the value of `k` is updated to `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, `k` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
