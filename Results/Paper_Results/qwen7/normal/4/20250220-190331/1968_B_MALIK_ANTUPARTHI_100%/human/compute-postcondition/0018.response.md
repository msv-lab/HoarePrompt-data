Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an integer obtained from input.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` must be greater than 0.
   - `c` is an integer obtained from input.
   - `d` is an input string.
   - `e` is a string obtained from input.
   - `k` is either `j` or `c` (whichever is met first).
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(b):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable in the for loop is `j`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `0 <= j < b`.

Given that `i` is 0 and `b` must be greater than 0, at the start of the loop, `j` will be 0. After each iteration of the loop, `j` will increment by 1.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
   - `b` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - All other variables (`t`, `a`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `k`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `b`.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is either `j` or `c` (whichever is met first), `j` is 1**
