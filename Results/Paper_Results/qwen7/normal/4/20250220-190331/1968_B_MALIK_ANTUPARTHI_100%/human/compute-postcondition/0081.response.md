Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `a` remains the same; `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `e = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `e`. The other variables (`b`, `c`, `i`, `a`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `e` is now an input string, while the rest of the variables retain their original values.
