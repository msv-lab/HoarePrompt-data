Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is an integer obtained from input
   - `i` is 0
   - `b` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `c` is an integer obtained from input
   - `d` is an input string
   - `e` is a string obtained from input
   - `k` is either the index of the last character of `d` in `e` starting from `k` (if all characters of `d` are found in `e`), or the value of `j` when no more characters of `d` can be found in `e[k:]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `a`. Therefore, `a` must remain unchanged.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - `a` remains unchanged
   - `i` becomes 1
   - `b` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `c` remains unchanged
   - `d` remains unchanged
   - `e` remains unchanged
   - `k` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 1, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, and `k` is either the index of the last character of `d` in `e` starting from `k` (if all characters of `d` are found in `e`), or the value of `j` when no more characters of `d` can be found in `e[k:]`.**
