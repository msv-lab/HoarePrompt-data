You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two binary strings \(a\) and \(b\) of specified lengths \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it finds the smallest index \(k\) in string \(b\) where a substring of \(b\) of length equal to the length of \(a\) can be found. If no such substring exists, it returns the length of \(b\). The function prints the value of \(k\) for each test case and does not return any value explicitly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly check if the prefix of string `a` up to a certain length forms a subsequence of string `b`.

Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Logic Issue**: The program attempts to find the index of the current character of `d` in the remaining part of `e` (`e[k:]`). However, it does not correctly update the position `k` to continue searching from the next character after the found index. This means it might miss valid subsequences.

2. **Break Logic**: The `break` statements are used in a way that might prematurely terminate the loop, which is not appropriate for finding the longest subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   4 6
   1011
   111011
   ```
   The expected output should be `4`, as the entire string `1011` is a subsequence of `111011`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `2` because it fails to correctly handle the sequence matching logic.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it continues searching from the correct position in `b` after finding a match and keeps track of the longest valid subsequence length.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        max_k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                index = e[k:].index(d[j])
                k += index + 1
                if j == b - 1 or d[j] != d[j + 1]:
                    max_k = max(max_k, k)
                    k = 0
        print(max_k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly finds the longest subsequence and handles edge cases appropriately.
