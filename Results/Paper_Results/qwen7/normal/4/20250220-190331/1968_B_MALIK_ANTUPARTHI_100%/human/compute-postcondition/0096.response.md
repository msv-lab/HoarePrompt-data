Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(b)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `b` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `d` is an input string.
   - `e` is an input string.
   - `k` is either `j` or `k == c` or `j == b - 1`.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `b`.
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be 1.
   - Therefore, `b` must remain greater than 1 (since `j` was 0 and it needs to become 1).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - `b` must still be greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `b` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` remains `i_end + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `d` is an input string.
   - `e` is an input string.
   - `k` is either `j` or `k == c` or `j == b - 1`. Since `j` is now 1, `k` could be 1 or `k == c` or `j == b - 1` (which simplifies to `k == c` since `b` is greater than 1).
   - `j` is now 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `b` must be greater than 1, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `a` remains the same, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is either `j` or `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, and `j` is 1.**
