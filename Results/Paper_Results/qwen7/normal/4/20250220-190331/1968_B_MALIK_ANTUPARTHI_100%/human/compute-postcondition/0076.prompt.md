Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 1, `b` is the first integer obtained from input, `c` is the second integer obtained from input, `d` is a new input string, `e` is updated to the new input string, `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d`, `e` is a list, and `k` is `j + 1 + e[k:].index(d[j])`. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not found in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, then `k` equals `j`, and we break out of the loop or operation we were inside.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is recalculated as `k = (j + 1) + 1 + e[j + 1:].index(d[j + 1]) + 1 + j + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is not met, `k` is recalculated as `k = j + 2 + e[k:].index(d[j + 1])`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `d[j]` is found in `e[k:]`, then either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, then `k` equals `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
