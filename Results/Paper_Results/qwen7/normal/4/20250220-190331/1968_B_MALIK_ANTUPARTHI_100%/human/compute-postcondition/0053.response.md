Output State: **`d[j]` is not in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end; `k` equals `j`; `d[j]` is an element of list `d`; and `e` is a list. We break out of the loop or operation we were inside.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we have exited the loop or operation we were currently inside. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
