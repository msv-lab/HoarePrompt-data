Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d`, `e` is a list, and `k` is `j + 1 + e[k:].index(d[j])`. If `d[j]` is found in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, and either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not found in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, then `k` equals `j`, and we break out of the loop or operation we were inside.
