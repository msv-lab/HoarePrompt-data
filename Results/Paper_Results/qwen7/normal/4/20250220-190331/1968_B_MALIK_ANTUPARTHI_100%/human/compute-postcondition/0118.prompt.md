Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, and `k` is either the index of the last character of `d` in `e` starting from `k` (if all characters of `d` are found in `e`), or the value of `j` when no more characters of `d` can be found in `e[k:]`. The variable `j` is set to `b-1` after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` will retain their values as they were after the last iteration of the loop. The variable `k` will hold the position in string `e` where the search for characters in `d` ends, or it could be the final value of `j` if no further matches were found in `e[k:]` during the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `k` will be an integer that represents the final position where the last character of `d` was found in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end, or it will be equal to `b` if no characters of `d` are found in `e` after the current value of `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `a` remains the same, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, `k` is the final value determined by the loop based on the conditions provided, and `j` is `b - 1`. The loop breaks when it either finds all characters in `d` within `e` starting from index `k` or reaches the end of the loop without finding all characters, ensuring `k` is updated accordingly.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be the last index position where the loop successfully found a character from `d` in `e`, or it will be equal to `b` if no such positions were found. The value of `j` will be `b - 1`, indicating the loop has completed its full range of iterations. The other variables (`b`, `i`, `a`, `d`, and `e`) retain their initial or updated values as per the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
