#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `res` will be equal to the total number of unique elements in the list `a` (considering the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), `n` will still be the original positive integer, `a` will remain as the list of `n` non-negative integers, and `count` will be a dictionary where each key is transformed using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The value associated with each key in `count` will reflect how many times the original number (before transformation) appeared in the list `a`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `res` will count the number of distinct elements in the list `a` when considering each element's transformed version, `n` and `a` will stay the same as they were initially, and `count` will map each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, still holding the original positive integer. The list `a` stays the same, containing the original `n` non-negative integers. The dictionary `count` maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It returns the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged after the function execution. Additionally, it creates a dictionary `count` that maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.
