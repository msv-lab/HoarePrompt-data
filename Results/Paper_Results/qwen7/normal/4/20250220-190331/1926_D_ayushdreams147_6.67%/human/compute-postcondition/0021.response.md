Output State: **`res` is either 3 or 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers with at least one element, and `count` is a dictionary where the second element of the list `a` is a key, `count`[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` was either 2 or 1 initially, it now becomes either 3 or 2 respectively. The values of `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states.
