Postcondition: `res` is either 1 or 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `count` is a dictionary. If the first element of the list `a` (`num`) is not in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. If the first element of the list `a` (`num`) is already in the dictionary `count`, then `res` is 0 and the value of each key in `count` is decreased by 1.
