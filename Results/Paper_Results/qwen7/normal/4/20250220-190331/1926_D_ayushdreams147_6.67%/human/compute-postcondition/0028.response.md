Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). The function returns `res`, the total number of unique elements in the list `a` after transforming each element using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The variable `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged. Additionally, the function creates a dictionary `count` that maps each transformed number to its frequency in the list `a`.**
