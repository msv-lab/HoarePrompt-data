Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged.
