#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each test case consists of three integers n, f, and k such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_i where 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        removed_count = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
                removed_count += 1
        
        favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
        
        if removed_count == favorite_count:
            print('YES')
        elif removed_count == 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: Output State: All variables outside the loop (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a_i`) retain their values from the initial state. After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `removed_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`. The value of `removed_count` will either be equal to `favorite_count` or less than `favorite_count`, depending on the distribution of `favorite_value` in the list `a` and the value of `k`. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, it means all instances of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a` have been removed. Otherwise, some instances of `favorite_value` remain in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_i \). For each test case, it determines whether removing up to \( k \) largest elements from the list \( a \) (after sorting in descending order) can result in all remaining elements being different from the \( f \)-th element in the original list. If removing exactly \( k \) largest elements results in no remaining elements matching the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'YES'. If no elements need to be removed to achieve this, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function outputs 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case and retains the input variables \( t \), \( n \), \( f \), \( k \), and the list \( a_i \) unchanged.
