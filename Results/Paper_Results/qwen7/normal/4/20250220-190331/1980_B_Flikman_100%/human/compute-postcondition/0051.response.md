Output State: **`removed_count` is `removed_count + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_count += 1` increments the value of `removed_count` by 1. Additionally, the condition `i < k - 1` ensures that `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was less than `k - 1` before the increment, after the increment, `i` will be `i + 1` and will still be less than `k - 1`. Therefore, the updated states are `removed_count` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 1.
