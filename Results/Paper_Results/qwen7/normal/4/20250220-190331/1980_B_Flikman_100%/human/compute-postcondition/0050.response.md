Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` can take values from `0` to `k-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is an integer less than `k - 1`.
   - `removed_count` is increased by 1 if `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is currently less than `k - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `removed_count` will either remain unchanged or increase by 1 depending on the condition `sorted_a[i] == favorite_value`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- The current value of `i` is less than `k - 1`.
- After the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, and it must be less than `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is an integer less than `k` and `removed_count` is increased by 1 if `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value`; otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.**
