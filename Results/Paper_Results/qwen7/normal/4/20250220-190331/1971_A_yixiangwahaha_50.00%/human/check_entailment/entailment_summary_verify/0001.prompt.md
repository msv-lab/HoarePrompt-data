You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4

    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and 10 pairs of integers `(x, y)` from the standard input. It then prints 10 lines, each containing two integers. For each pair, if the first integer (`x`) is less than the second integer (`y`), it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. After processing all pairs, the function does not return anything but modifies the lists `x` and `y` in place.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t` from the input, which is supposed to be the number of test cases.
   - However, the program then uses a fixed loop (`for i in range(10)`) to read `x` and `y` values. This means it will always read 10 pairs of values regardless of the value of `t`.

2. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases. It processes all 10 pairs of values in one go, even if `t` is less than 10.
   - If `t` is less than 10, the remaining slots in the lists `x` and `y` will contain garbage values, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Comparing and Printing:**
   - For each pair `(x[i], y[i])`, the program correctly prints the minimum and maximum values.
   - However, since the input handling is flawed, this part might still work correctly for the first `t` pairs but will be affected by the garbage values for the remaining pairs.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle the number of test cases (`t`), it will produce incorrect results if `t` is less than 10. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
