Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 9, `xylist` is a list containing the split input values from the last iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain 10 elements where the first element is the first value of `xylist`, the second element is the second value of `xylist` converted to an integer, the third element is the first value of `xylist` again, and so on, alternating between the first and second values of `xylist`. The list `y` will contain 9 elements, each being the second value of `xylist` from the respective iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    if x[i] < y[i]:
        print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
    else:
        print(y[i], ' ', x[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 0, and `x[i]` is compared with `y[i]` such that if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the condition remains as is; otherwise, `x[i]` is not less than `y[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 1, and if `x[i] < y[i]`, then no change occurs; otherwise, no change occurs as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 2. If `x[i]` (which is `x[2]`) is less than `y[i]` (which is `y[1]`), the postcondition remains as the initial state. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains as the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
