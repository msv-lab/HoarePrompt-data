Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing 10 elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`, `y` is a list containing 9 elements `int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 9, `xylist` is a list containing the split input values from the last iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations, the list `x` will contain 10 elements where the first element is the first value of `xylist`, the second element is the second value of `xylist` converted to an integer, the third element is the first value of `xylist` again, and so on, alternating between the first and second values of `xylist`. The list `y` will contain 9 elements, each being the second value of `xylist` from the respective iteration.
