Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is a list containing three elements `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0])]`, `y` is a list containing two elements `int(xylist[1])`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `y.append(int(xylist[1]))` appends the value of `int(xylist[1])` to the list `y`. Since `y` was initially a list containing one element `int(xylist[1])`, after appending, `y` will now contain two elements, both of which are `int(xylist[1])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
