Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` is a list containing 10 elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` is a list containing 9 elements: `[int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `i` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `i` is 2, we need to look at the 3rd element in both lists `x` and `y`.
   - The 3rd element of `x` is `int(xylist[0])`.
   - The 3rd element of `y` is `int(xylist[1])`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the 3rd element of `x` followed by a space, then the 3rd element of `y`.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **int(xylist[0]) int(xylist[1])**
