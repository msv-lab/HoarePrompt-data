Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by space.**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes an input string from the user and splits it into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters. The original values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variable `xylist` is created and assigned the result of the split operation.
