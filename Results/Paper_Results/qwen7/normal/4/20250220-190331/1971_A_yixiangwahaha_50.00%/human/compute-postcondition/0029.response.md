Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` is a list with 10 elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` is a list with 9 elements: `[int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])`.
   - Given `i` is 1, we need to find the values of `y[1]` and `x[1]`.

3. **Value Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is 1, we look at the first element of both lists `y` and `x`.
   - `y[1]` is the second element of the list `y`, which is `int(xylist[1])`.
   - `x[1]` is the second element of the list `x`, which is `int(xylist[1])`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `y[1]` followed by a space, then `x[1]`.
   - Both `y[1]` and `x[1]` are `int(xylist[1])`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **int(xylist[1]) int(xylist[1])**
