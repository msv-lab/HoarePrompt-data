Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `x` is a list containing 10 elements: `[xylist[0], int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[0]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `y` is a list containing 9 elements: `[int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1]), int(xylist[1])]`.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(x[i], ' ', y[i])` will print the `i`-th element of the list `x` followed by a space and then the `i`-th element of the list `y`.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `i` is 1, we need to find the 1st element of `x` and the 1st element of `y`.
   - The 1st element of `x` is `xylist[0]`.
   - The 1st element of `y` is `int(xylist[1])`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **xylist[0] int(xylist[1])**
