### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's carefully analyze the program and the problem statement to identify the issues.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

#### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. However, the formula used in the program does not correctly reflect the logic required to determine Bob's wins.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bob's Wins:**
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\) does not accurately represent the optimal strategy for Bob.
   - Specifically, the term \(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\) is not relevant to determining Bob's wins because it does not account for the actual bitwise XOR operations and the optimal removal strategy.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Bob:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers such that the remaining sequence has a bitwise XOR of zero.
   - The optimal strategy involves removing pairs of numbers that have the same value, as well as single occurrences of 1, 2, and 3 to balance the XOR result.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to consider the following:
- Count the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- Remove pairs of numbers to minimize the impact on the XOR result.
- Ensure that the remaining sequence has a bitwise XOR of zero.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's re-evaluate the examples provided in the original assessment:

1. **Case 1: (1, 1, 1, 0)**
   - Removing one 1, one 2, and one 3 would leave no numbers, resulting in a XOR of zero. Thus, Bob wins once.
   - Correct Output: 1

2. **Case 2: (1, 0, 1, 2)**
   - Removing one 1 and one 3 would leave no numbers, resulting in a XOR of zero. Thus, Bob wins once.
   - Correct Output: 1

3. **Case 3: (2, 2, 2, 0)**
   - Removing two 2s would leave no numbers, resulting in a XOR of zero. Thus, Bob wins twice.
   - Correct Output: 2

4. **Case 4: (3, 3, 2, 0)**
   - Removing two 3s and one 2 would leave no numbers, resulting in a XOR of zero. Thus, Bob wins twice.
   - Correct Output: 2

5. **Case 5: (0, 9, 9, 9)**
   - Removing pairs of 9s would leave no numbers, resulting in a XOR of zero. Thus, Bob wins nine times.
   - Correct Output: 9

#### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The correct approach involves a different strategy for removing numbers to ensure the remaining sequence has a bitwise XOR of zero.

**Final: False**
