### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the program's logic.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- The goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins by optimally removing numbers from the sequence.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program iterates over the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
- The program then calculates and prints:
  \[
  \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor + \left( \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3) \right)
  \]

#### Key Points:
1. **Integer Division by 2**: \(\left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor\) effectively counts how many pairs of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s can be removed without changing the parity of the count.
2. **Modulo Operation**: \(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2\) gives the sum of the remainders when \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are divided by 2. If this sum is 3, it means there are exactly 3 odd numbers among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly counts the number of pairs that can be removed without affecting the parity of the count.
- The additional term \(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\) ensures that if there are exactly 3 odd numbers among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), it adds 1 to the result.

This logic aligns with the requirement to maximize the number of times Bob wins. Specifically, Bob wins if the sequence's XOR is zero, which happens when the number of 1s, 3s, and the presence of odd numbers among 1s, 2s, and 3s can be managed to ensure the XOR remains zero.

#### Example Verification:
- Consider the input `1 1 1 0`:
  - The sequence is `[1, 1, 1, 0]`.
  - The bitwise XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 0 = 1`, so Alice wins.
  - The program calculates:
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor + \left( \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) \right) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
    \]
  - The output is `0`, which is correct since Bob cannot win.

- Consider the input `1 0 1 2`:
  - The sequence is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2]`.
  - The bitwise XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0`, so Bob wins.
  - The program calculates:
    \[
    \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor + \left( \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 0 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) \right) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1
    \]
  - The output is `1`, which is correct since Bob wins once.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
