Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the expression used to determine the number of iterations is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run for `int(input())` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `x + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be `x + 1` at the start of the current iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 2`.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration to occur, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be `x + 2` (where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `int(input())` remains the same as it is determined by user input and does not change within the loop.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `d` is an integer, `i` is `x + 2` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, `int(input())` is the same as before.**
