To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. **`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`**: This part of the expression performs integer division of each of the integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2. The result of each division is an integer, and these results are then summed up.

2. **`int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`**: This part involves the modulus operation (`%`) which gives the remainder when each of `a`, `b`, and `c` is divided by 2. The expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` will yield a number between 0 and 3 depending on the remainders. The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` checks if the sum of these remainders equals 3. If it does, the result is `True`, which is converted to `1` by `int()`. If not, the result is `False`, which is converted to `0`.

Combining these parts, the expression evaluates to the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus either 0 or 1 based on the condition involving the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given the initial state where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers entered by the user, the exact values of these integers are unknown. Therefore, the output will depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Output: **the sum of a // 2, b // 2, c // 2, and d // 2, plus 1 if the sum of a % 2, b % 2, and c % 2 is 3, otherwise 0**
