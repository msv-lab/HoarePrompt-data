The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the total count of these numbers by taking half of each count (using integer division) and adding one if the sum of the odd parts of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s equals 3. The function outputs this calculation for each test case.
