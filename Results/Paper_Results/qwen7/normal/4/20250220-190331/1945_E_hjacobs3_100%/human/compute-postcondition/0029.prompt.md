You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution. The loop has terminated because `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `l` and `r` are adjacent indices in the array.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `l` and `r` will point to two consecutive elements in the array, and `mid` will be the midpoint between `l` and `r` from the last iteration of the loop. The loop has effectively narrowed down the search range to a single element or a pair of elements, but since the exact position of `find` relative to the array elements is not specified, we can only conclude that `l` and `r` are adjacent.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in the array incremented by 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` and `r` are such that `r - l` is no longer greater than 1, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution. `l` and `r` point to two consecutive elements in the array, and `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in the array incremented by 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
