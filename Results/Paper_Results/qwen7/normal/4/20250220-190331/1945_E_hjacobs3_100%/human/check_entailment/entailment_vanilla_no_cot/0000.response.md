Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `l` and `r`:**
   - In the function `func_1`, the variables `l` and `r` are initialized incorrectly. They should be set to `1` and `n + 1` respectively, as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search implementation in `func_1` does not correctly handle the conditions to find the correct position for `x`. Specifically, the loop condition and the assignment of `l` and `r` need to be adjusted to match the problem's requirements.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The function `func_1` prints the result directly instead of returning it. This means the results are not captured and printed correctly in the main loop.

4. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The logic to perform the swaps is missing. The function should identify the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct index and then perform those swaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (1, n + 1)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid - 1] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find) + 1:
        # Find the index of x in the array
        idx_x = array.index(find) + 1
        # Perform the necessary swaps
        if l < idx_x:
            array[l - 1], array[idx_x - 1] = array[idx_x - 1], array[l - 1]
            return [str(l), str(idx_x)]
        else:
            array[r - 2], array[idx_x - 1] = array[idx_x - 1], array[r - 2]
            return [str(r - 1), str(idx_x)]
    else:
        return [0]
```

This corrected version initializes `l` and `r` correctly, implements the binary search properly, and ensures the necessary swaps are performed to place `x` at the correct index.
