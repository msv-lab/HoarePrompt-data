Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while r - l > 1:`. The variables involved in this condition are `r` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: 
   - If `array[mid] <= find`, then:
     - `l` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`
     - `r` remains unchanged
     - `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`
   - Otherwise (if `array[mid] > find`):
     - `l` remains unchanged
     - `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`
     - `r` is updated to `mid`

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `r - l > 1` must still hold true.

4. **Analyze the Update Rules**:
   - In both cases, the difference `r - l` decreases, but as long as it is still greater than 1, the loop will continue.
   - Therefore, the key is to ensure that `r - l > 1` after the updates.

5. **Ensure the Condition Holds**:
   - After each update, check if `r - l > 1` still holds.
   - If `r - l` becomes 1 or less, the loop will terminate.

Given the updates:
- If `array[mid] <= find`, `l` is updated to `(l + r) // 2` and `r` remains unchanged.
- If `array[mid] > find`, `l` remains unchanged and `r` is updated to `mid`.

To ensure `r - l > 1` after the updates:
- If `array[mid] <= find`, `l` becomes smaller, but `r` remains the same, so `r - l` decreases.
- If `array[mid] > find`, `r` becomes smaller, but `l` remains the same, so `r - l` decreases.

In both cases, the difference `r - l` decreases, but as long as it is still greater than 1, the loop will continue.

Therefore, no specific adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `r` beyond ensuring they follow the update rules. The loop will continue as long as `r - l > 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions in the loop body, and `r - l > 1` must still hold true**.
