Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` must be such that `r - l > 1`, `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`, `r` is now `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `r = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `r`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `r - l > 1` still holds true, and `mid` is updated to be `(l + r) // 2`.
