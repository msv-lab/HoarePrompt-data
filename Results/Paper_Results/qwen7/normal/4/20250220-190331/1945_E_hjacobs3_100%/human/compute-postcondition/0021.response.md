Output State: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` and `r` are final values determined by the last iteration of the loop such that `r - l == 1`, and `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.

In this final state, the binary search process has concluded, with `l` and `r` converging to adjacent indices. This means the loop has finished executing, and the search range no longer spans more than one element. The value of `mid` is the midpoint of the last valid search range.
