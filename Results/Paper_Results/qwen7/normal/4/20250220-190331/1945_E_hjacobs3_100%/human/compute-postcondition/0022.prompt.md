Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
while r - l > 1:
    mid = (l + r) // 2
    if array[mid] <= find:
        l = mid
    else:
        r = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` is either `mid` or 0, `r` is either n or `mid`, depending on whether `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find` or greater than `find`, respectively, and `mid` remains as (0 + n) // 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`, `r` remains unchanged, and `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged, `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`, and `r` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions in the loop body, and `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] <= find`, then `l` is now equal to `mid` and `r - l > 1` still holds true. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is updated to `mid`, and `r - l > 1` still holds true.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
