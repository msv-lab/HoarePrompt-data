Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions in the loop body, and `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`, and `r - l > 1` still holds true.**

This means that the variable `mid` has been assigned the value of `(l + r) // 2`, and the conditions for `l` and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state, ensuring that `r - l > 1` still holds true.
