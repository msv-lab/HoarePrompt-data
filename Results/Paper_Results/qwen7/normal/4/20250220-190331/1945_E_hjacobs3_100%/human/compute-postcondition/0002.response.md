Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while r - l > 1:`. The variables involved here are `r` and `l`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `r - l > 1`. This means that for the first iteration of the loop, `r - l` must be greater than 1.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n`.

4. **Calculate the Current Value of `r - l`**:
   - Given `l = 0` and `r = n`, the current value of `r - l` is `n - 0 = n`.

5. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `r - l` must be greater than 1.
   - Currently, `r - l = n`.
   - To satisfy `r - l > 1`, `n` must be greater than 1.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` (which is the same as `r`) is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `r - l > 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and `l` is 0, `r` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1**
