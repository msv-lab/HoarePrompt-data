Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[i] * 2`.**

In this scenario, the value of `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[i]`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `ans1` or `a[i]`, so we can only express the change in terms of these variables. The state of other variables remains unchanged from the initial state.
