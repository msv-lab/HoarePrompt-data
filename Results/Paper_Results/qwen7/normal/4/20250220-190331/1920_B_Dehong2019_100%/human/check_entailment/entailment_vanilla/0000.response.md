Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is crucial because Alice will want to remove the largest elements, and Bob will want to negate the smallest elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum (`ans1`):**
   - The initial sum of the array (`ans1`) is calculated using the sorted array.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Bob:**
   - The program iterates through the top `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice their values from `ans1`. This simulates Bob negating the smallest `x` elements.
   - This step ensures that Bob is minimizing the sum by negating the smallest elements.

5. **Optimal Strategy for Alice:**
   - The program iterates through the top `k` elements of the sorted array and adds them to `ans1`.
   - It also checks if adding these elements and then negating the corresponding elements (if within bounds) results in a higher sum.
   - This step ensures that Alice is maximizing the sum by removing the largest `k` elements and considering the impact of Bob's negations.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The maximum value between the two sums (`ans1` and `ans2`) is printed, which represents the optimal sum after both players play their moves.

### Verification:

- **Alice's Removal:**
  - Alice removes the largest `k` elements, ensuring the sum is maximized before Bob makes his moves.
- **Bob's Negation:**
  - Bob negates the smallest `x` elements, ensuring the sum is minimized after Alice's removals.
- **Combining Both Strategies:**
  - The program considers both strategies and finds the best possible outcome.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
