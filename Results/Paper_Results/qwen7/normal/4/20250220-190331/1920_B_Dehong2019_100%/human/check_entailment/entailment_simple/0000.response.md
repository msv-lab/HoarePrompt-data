### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.
   
2. **Sorting and Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order, which is a good start for Alice's strategy to remove the largest elements.
   - The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the sorted array.

3. **Alice's Removal Strategy**:
   - Alice removes up to `k` elements. The program calculates `ans1` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements from the initial sum. This is because removing an element and negating `x` elements later has the same effect as removing `x` elements directly.

4. **Bob's Negation Strategy**:
   - Bob can negate up to `x` elements. The program iterates through the first `k` elements and considers the impact of negating each of these elements along with up to `x` other elements.
   - It updates `ans1` by adding back the removed element and subtracting twice the value of the element that would be negated by Bob.
   - The maximum value between the original `ans1` and the updated `ans1` is stored in `ans2`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints `ans2` for each test case, which represents the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

### Analysis:
- The logic for handling Alice's removal and Bob's negation is sound and follows the optimal strategies for both players.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and input sizes as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem and produces the correct results based on the given examples.
