Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` multiplied by 2; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. The value of `ans1` is updated by decreasing it by the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` multiplied by 2. Therefore, `ans2` will have the same value as the updated `ans1`.
