Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` is `ans1` minus twice the value of `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 1, it specifically subtracts twice the value of `a[1]` from `ans1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the value of `x` is not affected by this operation.
