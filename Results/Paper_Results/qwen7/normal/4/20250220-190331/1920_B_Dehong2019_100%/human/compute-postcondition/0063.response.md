Output State: **`ans1` is the value after subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from the previous iteration's value, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` must be less than `k`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates `ans2` to be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of `ans1`, `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states.
