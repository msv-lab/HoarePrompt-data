Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in list `a` from index 0 to n-1 minus twice the sum of elements in list `a` from index x to n-1, `ans2` is equal to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

This output state describes the final values of `ans1` and `ans2` after the loop has executed all its iterations. `ans1` accumulates the net effect of adding and subtracting elements from the list `a` based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop runs from `i` starting at 0 up to `k-1`, and during each iteration, it adds `a[i]` to `ans1` and subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x` is within bounds. `ans2` keeps track of the maximum value of `ans1` seen so far. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, and `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to run three or more times as per the given conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ans1` is the sum of all elements in list `a` from index `x` to index `n-1` (inclusive), with the elements from index `x + 2 * k` to `n-1` being counted only once (each counted twice in the first iteration and subtracted once in subsequent iterations). `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations. The variable `k` remains unchanged, `t` is decreased by `x * k`, and the list `a` and the input integer `n` remain as they were initially.

This output state is calculated by observing that the loop iterates `k` times, each time updating `ans1` by adding the current element of `a` indexed by `i` and potentially subtracting twice the value of the element indexed by `i + x` if the condition `i + x < n` holds. The variable `ans2` keeps track of the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is 0, `ans1` is the initial sum of all elements in list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in list `a` plus the sum of the elements from index `i - x` to `i - 1` in the list `a`, `ans2` is the maximum value between its original value and `ans1`, `t` is decreased by `k * x * k`, and `i + x` is less than or equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k` (which becomes 0), and the loop will no longer execute because the condition `i + x < n` will no longer be satisfied. The value of `ans1` will be the sum of the elements from index `i - x` to `i - 1` added to the initial calculation, and `ans2` will hold the maximum value between its original value and the final `ans1`. The variable `t` will be decreased by `k * x * k`, which is effectively `0` since `k` becomes `0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
