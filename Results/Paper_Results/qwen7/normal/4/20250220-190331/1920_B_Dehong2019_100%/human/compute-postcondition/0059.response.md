Output State: **`ans1` is the value after adding `a[i]` to the previous iteration's value, `i` is `x + 1`, `x` must be less than `k`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true.**

This means that `ans1` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to its previous value, where `i` is now `x + 1`. The conditions that `x` must be less than `k` and `n` must satisfy `i + x < n` remain unchanged.
