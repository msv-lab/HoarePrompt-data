To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while high >= cur:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Given States
- `t` is `k-1`
- `p1` is an input integer
- `p2` is an input integer
- `p3` is an input integer
- `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 2.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves `high` and `cur`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `high >= cur` remains true after the adjustments.

### Adjustments Needed
- **`high`**: Since the loop condition is `high >= cur`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur` for the loop to continue.
- **`cur`**: The value of `cur` can change inside the loop, but for the loop to continue, `high` must still be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given that the loop can continue as long as `high >= cur`, we need to ensure that this condition holds true. Since `cur` is incremented by 2 within the loop, we need to ensure that `high` is sufficiently large to accommodate the next increment of `cur`.

### Conclusion
We need to adjust the state such that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 2` (since `cur` is incremented by 2 in each iteration).

### Final State
State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 2`, and if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 2.**

This ensures that the loop condition `high >= cur` remains true for the next iteration.
