### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is a necessary condition because each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points (1 to each player in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct and ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

3. **Handling Invalid Scores:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. This condition is not strictly necessary for the logic but might handle some edge cases where the scores are invalid in a specific context. However, it is not sufficient to validate the scores completely.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates the lower bound (`low`) and upper bound (`high`) for the number of draws.
   - It initializes `cur` to `low` and iterates while `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current number of draws (`cur`) is feasible by comparing the adjusted scores of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no valid number of draws is found within the bounds, it prints `p3`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it should ensure that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
   - The condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` is not sufficient to validate the scores. It should be checked whether the scores can be achieved through a valid sequence of games.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program assumes that the scores can always be adjusted by a certain number of draws, which is not necessarily true.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not correctly formulated to ensure the scores are achievable.

3. **Output for Valid Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. It prints `p1 + p2` or `p3` without ensuring these values are achievable through a valid sequence of games.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the scores can be achieved through a valid sequence of games. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Check Total Points:**
   - Ensure the sum of the points is even.

2. **Validate Scores:**
   - Check if `p3 >= p1 + p2` and `p2 >= p1`.

3. **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
   - Use a binary search approach to find the maximum number of draws that can achieve the given scores.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 < p1 + p2 or p2 < p1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        low, high = 0, min(p1, p2)
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            score_p1 = p1 - mid
            score_p2 = p2 - mid
            score_p3 = p3 - mid
            
            if score_p1 + score_p2 + score_p3 == (p1 + p2 + p3) - 2 * mid and \
               score_p1 >= 0 and score_p2 >= 0 and score_p3 >= 0:
                print(mid)
                break
            elif score_p1 + score_p2 + score_p3 > (p1 + p2 + p3) - 2 * mid:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
