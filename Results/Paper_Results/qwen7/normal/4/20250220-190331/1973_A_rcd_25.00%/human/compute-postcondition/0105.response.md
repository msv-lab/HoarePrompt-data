Output State: **`t` is 0, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, if `t` was initially greater than 0, the loop would decrement `t` until it reaches 0. Given that the loop processes one input set per iteration and the problem does not specify any conditions under which `t` would increase, we assume `t` will eventually reach 0 after all iterations. Once `t` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their last assigned values from the final iteration of the loop.
