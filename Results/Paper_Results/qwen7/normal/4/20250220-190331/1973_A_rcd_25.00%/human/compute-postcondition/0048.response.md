Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `low`**.

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `low`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged from their initial states.
