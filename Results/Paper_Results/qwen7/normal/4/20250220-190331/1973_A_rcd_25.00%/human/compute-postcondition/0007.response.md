Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues the loop. There is no change to the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` in the else part since no other operations are specified.
