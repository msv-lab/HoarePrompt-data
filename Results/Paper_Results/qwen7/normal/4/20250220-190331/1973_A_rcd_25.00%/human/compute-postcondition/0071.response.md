Postcondition: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high` if `p3 < p1 + p2`; otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
