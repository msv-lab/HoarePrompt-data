Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Sum Parity**: The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is a necessary condition because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).

3. **Handling Special Case**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program directly prints `p1 + p2`. This is a special case where the maximum score of the highest scorer (`p3`) is at least the sum of the scores of the other two players. In this scenario, it's impossible to have any draws, and the solution is straightforward.

4. **General Case Calculation**: For the general case, the program calculates `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and `p1`, and `p3` and `p2`. It then iteratively adjusts `cur` to find the maximum number of draws that can satisfy the conditions. The key logic here is to ensure that the difference in scores between the players can be balanced out by the number of draws. The loop ensures that the number of draws is maximized while maintaining the constraints.

5. **Output Handling**: The program correctly handles the output for each test case and ensures that the final result is printed for each case.

Given the logical flow and the constraints handled correctly, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided states.

Correctness: **True**
