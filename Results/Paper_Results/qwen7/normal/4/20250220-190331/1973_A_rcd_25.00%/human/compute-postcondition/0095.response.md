Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**: The loop condition depends on the variables `high` and `cur`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition and loop body**: 
   - The postcondition mentions that if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1 and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

4. **Consider the loop body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot directly infer what happens inside the loop. However, based on the postcondition, if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not met, `cur` is incremented by 1 and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `high >= cur` must hold true.
   - If the loop breaks due to the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then the loop will not execute again.
   - If the loop continues, `cur` will be incremented by 1, and `high` must still be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `cur` should be incremented by 1.
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration, adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, is:

**State: `t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is incremented by 1, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur+1`**.
