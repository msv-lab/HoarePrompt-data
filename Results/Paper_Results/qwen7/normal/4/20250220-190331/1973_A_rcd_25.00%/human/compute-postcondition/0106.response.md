Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined constraints for t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. Specifically, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function evaluates these parameters and returns a value accordingly.**
