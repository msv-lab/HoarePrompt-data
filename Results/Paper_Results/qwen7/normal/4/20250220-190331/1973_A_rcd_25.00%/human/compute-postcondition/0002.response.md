Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them into `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 500, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned the values from the input split.
