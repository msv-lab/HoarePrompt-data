Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and checks if the sum of these scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the total score must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).
3. It then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws if the scores are consistent with a scenario where the third player won all games against the first and second players.
4. If the above condition is false, it calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, respectively. It then iterates from `low` to `high`, checking if the current value of `cur` can be a valid number of draws. Specifically, it ensures that the difference in scores between the first and third players (`p1 - cur`) does not exceed the difference in scores between the second and third players (`p2 - (p3 - cur)`). If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` as the maximum number of draws.
5. If no valid number of draws is found within the loop, it prints `p3`.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program appears to handle all cases correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
