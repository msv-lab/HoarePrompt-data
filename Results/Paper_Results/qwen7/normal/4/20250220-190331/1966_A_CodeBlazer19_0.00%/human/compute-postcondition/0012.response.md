Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split()), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the second integer input from the user split by space, `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split()).**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, updating the list `l`. All other variables (`k`, `i`, `n`, and the original `l`) remain unchanged.
