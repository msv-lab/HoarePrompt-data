Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The relevant variables here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
   - `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user, split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `i` is `t`.
   - `n` is the first integer input from the user, split by space.
   - `k` is the second integer input from the user, split by space.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts as `t` and the loop increments `i` in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `t + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `t` again, which means `i` should be `t` again, but incremented by 1, making it `t + 1`.
   - Therefore, `t` remains the same, and `i` is `t + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `l` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `t + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split()), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the second integer input from the user split by space**
