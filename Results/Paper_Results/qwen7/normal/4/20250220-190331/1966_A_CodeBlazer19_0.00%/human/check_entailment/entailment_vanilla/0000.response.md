Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program does not actually process the list of card numbers. Instead, it directly prints `k - 1`.

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - According to the problem, the goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand after performing the specified operations.
   - The operations allow exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards.
   - The minimum number of cards that can be left depends on the distribution of card numbers and the value of `k`.

4. **Output Analysis:**
   - The program always prints `k - 1` regardless of the input values.
   - This is not a correct solution because the output should depend on the actual distribution of card numbers, not just the value of `k`.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1:** `5 3`
  - Expected Output: The minimum number of cards after operations depends on the distribution of the cards. For example, if all cards are the same, the minimum number could be 2. The program outputs `2 - 1 = 1`, which is incorrect.
- **Case 2:** `1 10`
  - Expected Output: Since there is only one card, no operations can be performed. The minimum number of cards is 1. The program outputs `10 - 1 = 9`, which is incorrect.
- **Case 4:** `10 4`
  - Expected Output: If all cards have the same number, the minimum number of cards after operations is 3 (since we can reduce by 1 card per operation). The program outputs `4 - 1 = 3`, which is correct in this specific scenario but incorrect in general.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it always outputs `k - 1` without considering the actual distribution of card numbers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
