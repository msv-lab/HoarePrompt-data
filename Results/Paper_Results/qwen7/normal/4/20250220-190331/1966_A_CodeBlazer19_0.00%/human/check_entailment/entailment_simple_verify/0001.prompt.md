You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the list of integers c contains n integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each c_i in c.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, and `i` is equal to `t`. After executing the loop, `n` will be the first integer input for the last iteration, `k` will be the second integer input for the last iteration, and `l` will be the list of integers for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `t`, `n` will be the `n` value from the last iteration, `k` will be the `k` value from the last iteration, and `l` will be the list `l` from the last iteration. All previous inputs for `n`, `k`, and lists `l` will have been processed and printed `k-1` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program does not actually process the list of card numbers. Instead, it directly prints `k - 1`.

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - According to the problem, the goal is to minimize the number of cards in the hand after performing the specified operations.
   - The operations allow exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards.
   - The minimum number of cards that can be left depends on the distribution of card numbers and the value of `k`.

4. **Output Analysis:**
   - The program always prints `k - 1` regardless of the input values.
   - This is not a correct solution because the output should depend on the actual distribution of card numbers, not just the value of `k`.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1:** `5 3`
  - Expected Output: The minimum number of cards after operations depends on the distribution of the cards. For example, if all cards are the same, the minimum number could be 2. The program outputs `2 - 1 = 1`, which is incorrect.
- **Case 2:** `1 10`
  - Expected Output: Since there is only one card, no operations can be performed. The minimum number of cards is 1. The program outputs `10 - 1 = 9`, which is incorrect.
- **Case 4:** `10 4`
  - Expected Output: If all cards have the same number, the minimum number of cards after operations is 3 (since we can reduce by 1 card per operation). The program outputs `4 - 1 = 3`, which is correct in this specific scenario but incorrect in general.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it always outputs `k - 1` without considering the actual distribution of card numbers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
