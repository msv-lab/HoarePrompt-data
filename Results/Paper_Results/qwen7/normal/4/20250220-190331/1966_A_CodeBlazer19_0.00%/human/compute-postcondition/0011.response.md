Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is updated to a new list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split()), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the second integer input from the user split by space**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `l`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from the previous state. Therefore, `l` is still the list of integers input from the user, `i` is now `t + 1`, and `n` and `k` are the newly input values.
