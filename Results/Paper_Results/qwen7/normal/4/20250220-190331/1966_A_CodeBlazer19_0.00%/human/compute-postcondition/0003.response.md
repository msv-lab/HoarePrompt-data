Output State: **`k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers input from the user split by space and converted using map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user split by spaces and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state and was not affected by the code. The variable `k` also remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
