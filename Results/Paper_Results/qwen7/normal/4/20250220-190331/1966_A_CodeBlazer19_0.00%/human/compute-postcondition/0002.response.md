Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer**.

This means that the values of `n` and `k` are set to integers obtained from the user's input, split by a space. The exact values of `n` and `k` depend on the user's input, but they are now integers.
