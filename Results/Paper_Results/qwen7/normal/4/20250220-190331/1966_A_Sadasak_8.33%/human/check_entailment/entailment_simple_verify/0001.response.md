### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the logic in the `func_1` function is unnecessary and that the program needs to check if `k` can be achieved as a frequency. However, the revised program provided in the original assessment still contains logical flaws and does not fully address the problem requirements.

#### Key Issues in the Original Program:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and complicates the solution. It limits the frequency of each card to `k`, but the problem does not require this limitation.
   - The function should simply count the occurrences of each card without any limitations.

2. **Incorrect Logic in Main Program:**
   - The main program checks if `k` is a value in the frequency table, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should check if we can reduce the number of cards to `k` or less by performing exchanges.
   - The logic should focus on reducing the count of any card to less than `k` or achieving exactly `k` cards.

#### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Count the occurrences of each card.
2. Determine the minimum number of cards that can be achieved by performing exchanges.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Determine the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = n
    for count in freq.values():
        if count >= k:
            min_cards = min(min_cards, count % k + (count // k) * (k - 1))
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - We use a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each card number.

2. **Determining Minimum Cards:**
   - For each frequency count, we calculate the minimum number of cards that can be achieved by performing exchanges.
   - If the count of a card is `count`, we can reduce it to `count % k` and exchange the remaining `(count // k) * (k - 1)` cards.
   - We update `min_cards` with the minimum value obtained from these calculations.

### Final Evaluation:

The original program had significant issues in both the function `func_1` and the main logic. The revised program provided in the original assessment still contains logical flaws and does not fully address the problem requirements. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
