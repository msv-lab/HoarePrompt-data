Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. For the loop to continue, `arr` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element).
   - `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`.
   - `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement. If `frequency_table[num]` was not greater than `k`, the values of `arr`, `num`, and `frequency_table` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, it means that `arr` has been modified to remove `num` from it.
   - Therefore, `arr` now contains at least one element (excluding the first element) because `num` has been removed.
   - The next `num` will be the new first element of the updated `arr`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `arr` will now be the list without the first element (`num`).
- `num` will be the new first element of the updated `arr`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement. If `frequency_table[num]` was not greater than `k`, the values of `arr`, `num`, and `frequency_table` remain unchanged.**

However, since `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, we can simplify the description:

**State: `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement.**

To be more precise and clear:

**State: `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement.**

This ensures that the loop can continue with the updated `arr` and `num`.
