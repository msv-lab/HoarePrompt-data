Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` is unnecessary**: The function `func_1` is not used correctly in the main logic. It modifies frequencies to ensure they do not exceed `k`, but this doesn't help in determining the minimum number of cards remaining.

2. **Incorrect handling of frequencies**: The logic to determine the minimum number of cards should consider the frequency of each card type. If the frequency of any card type is less than `k`, those cards cannot be exchanged, and thus, they will remain in the hand.

3. **Simpler approach needed**: Instead of using `func_1`, we can directly count the occurrences of each card type and determine how many cards can be exchanged and how many will remain.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_left += count % k
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

This version correctly counts the frequency of each card and calculates the minimum number of cards that will remain after performing the allowed operations.
