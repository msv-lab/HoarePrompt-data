You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` will be an empty list, and `frequency_table` will contain the count of each unique number in `arr` capped at `k`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each number in `arr`, incrementing its count in `frequency_table`. If the count of any number exceeds `k`, it is reset to `k`. Once all elements in `arr` have been processed, `arr` becomes empty since all elements have been consumed during iteration. The `frequency_table` will then hold the final counts of each unique number from `arr`, ensuring no count exceeds `k`.
    return frequency_table
    #`frequency_table` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique number from the original `arr`, with all counts capped at `k` and `arr` is an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k` where 2 <= k <= 100. It returns a frequency table as a dictionary containing the count of each unique number from the original `arr`, with all counts capped at `k`, and the list `arr` is made empty.

```

Return Postconditions: `frequency_table` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique number from the original `arr`, with all counts capped at `k` and `arr` is an empty list


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
