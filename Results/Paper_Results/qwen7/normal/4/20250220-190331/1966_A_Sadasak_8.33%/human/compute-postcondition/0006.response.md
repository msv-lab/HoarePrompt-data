Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k+1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` initially. If `frequency_table[num]` was not greater than `k`, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
