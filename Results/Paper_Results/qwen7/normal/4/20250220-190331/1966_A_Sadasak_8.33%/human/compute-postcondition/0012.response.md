Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num` which is being iterated over in the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element). This means `arr` has at least one element left to iterate over.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `arr` to iterate over. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `arr` still contains at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - **`arr`**: Since the loop will continue if `arr` still contains at least one element, `arr` must still contain at least one element.
   - **`num`**: `num` will be the next element in `arr` that the loop will process.
   - **`frequency_table[num]`**: The value of `frequency_table[num]` will either remain unchanged or be set to `k + 1` if it was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement. However, since we are looking at the state before the next iteration, we cannot assume any change unless explicitly stated. Therefore, we keep the condition that `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if it was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `arr` must still contain at least one element.
- `num` will be the next element in `arr`.
- `frequency_table[num]` will be equal to `k + 1` if it was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement.**

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1` if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the execution of the if statement.**
