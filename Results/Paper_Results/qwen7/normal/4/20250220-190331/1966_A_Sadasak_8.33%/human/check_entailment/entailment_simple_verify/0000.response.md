### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step and compare it against the problem description and the given test cases.

#### Initial Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), followed by the number of cards (`n`) and the value of `k` for each test case. It also reads the list of card values (`nums`).
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`, which is correct because no exchanges can be made.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`, which is also correct because only one exchange can be made.
3. **General Case**:
   - The program calls `func_1` to get the frequency table of card values.
   - If `k` appears in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` creates a frequency table for the card values, ensuring no value exceeds `k`.
- This function ensures that the maximum count of any card is limited to `k`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   5 3
   4 1 1 4 4
   ```
   - The optimal solution is to exchange 3 cards with value 4 for 2 new cards, leaving 2 cards.
   - The program correctly prints `2`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   ```
   1 10
   7
   ```
   - No exchanges can be made, so the program prints `1`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   ```
   7 2
   4 2 1 100 5 2 3
   ```
   - The optimal solution is to exchange 2 cards with value 2 for 1 new card, leaving 1 card.
   - The program correctly prints `1`.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   ```
   10 4
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   ```
   - The optimal solution is to exchange 4 cards with value 1 for 3 new cards, repeating until 3 cards remain.
   - The program correctly prints `3`.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   ```
   5 2
   3 8 1 48 7
   ```
   - No exchanges can be made, so the program prints `5`, which is correct.

6. **Test Case 6**:
   ```
   6 2
   10 20 30 10 20 40
   ```
   - No exchanges can be made, so the program prints `6`, which is correct.

7. **Test Case 7**:
   ```
   6 3
   10 20 30 10 20 40
   ```
   - No exchanges can be made, so the program prints `6`, which is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` ensures that the frequency of any card does not exceed `k`, which is necessary to ensure the optimal solution is found. The program logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
