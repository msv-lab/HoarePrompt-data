Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `frequency_table[num] = k` updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. The other variables (`arr` and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
