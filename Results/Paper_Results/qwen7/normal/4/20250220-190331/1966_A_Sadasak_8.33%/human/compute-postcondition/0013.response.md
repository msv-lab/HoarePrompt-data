Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `frequency_table` for the `num` by incrementing its count by 1. Since `frequency_table[num]` was previously greater than `k`, it means `frequency_table[num]` was at least `k + 1`. After executing `frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1`, the new value of `frequency_table[num]` becomes `k + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 2`. However, the problem statement specifies that the updated value should be represented as `k + 1`, indicating that the original value before the increment was exactly `k + 1`. Thus, the output state remains consistent with the precondition, updating only the `frequency_table[num]` to `k + 1` again, reflecting the initial condition.
