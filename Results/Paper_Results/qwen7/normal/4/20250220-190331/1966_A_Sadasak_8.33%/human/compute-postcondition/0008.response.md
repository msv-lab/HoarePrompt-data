Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), `num` is the first element of the updated `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `frequency_table[num] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `frequency_table[num]` by 1. Since `frequency_table[num]` was initially greater than `k`, its new value is now `frequency_table[num] + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
