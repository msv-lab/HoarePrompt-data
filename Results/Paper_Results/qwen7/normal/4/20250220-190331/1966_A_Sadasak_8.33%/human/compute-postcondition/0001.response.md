Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary and is not part of the loop head.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. The loop will start with the first element of `arr` and continue until all elements have been processed.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `arr` is a list, we need to ensure it contains at least one element for the loop to execute. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not run.
   - `num` will take on the value of each element in `arr` starting from the first element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `num` must be set to the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`**.
