Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It also correctly handles the input for `n` and `k` for each test case, followed by the list of card numbers.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`, which is correct because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`, which is correct because all cards can be replaced with `k - 1` new cards.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program calls the `func_1` function to process the list of card numbers and cap their frequencies at `k`.
   - The `func_1` function correctly creates a frequency table where each number's count is capped at `k`.
   - After processing, the program checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1` because we can perform operations to reduce the count of this number to `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n` because no further reduction is possible.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly updates the frequency table to ensure no value exceeds `k`.
   - However, the function returns the frequency table itself rather than the keys (unique numbers) and their capped counts. This is not directly used in the main logic, but it might cause confusion if the caller expects a different output format.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct minimum number of cards for each test case based on the logic described.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is correct and handles all specified cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
