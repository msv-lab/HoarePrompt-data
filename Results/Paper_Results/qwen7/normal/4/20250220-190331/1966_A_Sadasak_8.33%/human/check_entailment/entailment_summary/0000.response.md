Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot select `k` cards, you must keep all `n` cards.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because exchanging all cards would leave you with `k - 1` cards.
3. **General Case**:
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table. If `k` is a value, it means there is at least one type of card that can be fully exchanged, leaving `k - 1` cards. This logic is correct.
   - If `k` is not in the values, it prints `n`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The problem asks for the minimum number of cards left, and if `k` is not a value in the frequency table, it means we cannot fully exchange any set of `k` cards, so we should aim to minimize the number of cards by exchanging as many sets of `k` as possible.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle the general case. It should calculate the minimum number of cards left by determining how many full exchanges of `k` cards can be made and then considering the remainder.

Correctness: **False**
