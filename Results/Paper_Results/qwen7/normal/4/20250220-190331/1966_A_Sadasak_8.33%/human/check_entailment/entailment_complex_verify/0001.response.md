### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect because it fails to properly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and provide a correct solution.

#### Issues in the Original Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and complicates the solution. It creates a frequency table but does not use it correctly to determine the minimum number of cards.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that no frequency exceeds `k`, but this is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Logic in Main Program**:
   - The main program checks if `k` is in the frequency table, which is not the correct approach.
   - Instead, we need to determine if we can reduce the number of cards to `k` or less by performing exchanges.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card.
2. Determine the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing exchanges.

Here is the revised program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Determine the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = n
    for count in freq.values():
        if count >= k:
            # Calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left
            min_cards = min(min_cards, count % k + (count // k) * (k - 1))
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - We create a frequency table `freq` to count how many times each card appears.

2. **Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - For each frequency `count` in the frequency table:
     - If `count` is greater than or equal to `k`, we calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left using the formula `count % k + (count // k) * (k - 1)`.
     - This formula ensures that we reduce the count of cards as much as possible while respecting the exchange rule.
   - We keep track of the minimum number of cards that can be left across all frequencies.

### Final Evaluation

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in both the `func_1` function and the main program. The revised program correctly implements the solution.

**Final: False**
