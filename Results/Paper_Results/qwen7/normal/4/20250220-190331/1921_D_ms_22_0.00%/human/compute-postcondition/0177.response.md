Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

This means that after executing the line of code `diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, the variable `diff1` is now holding the absolute difference between the second element of the `item` tuple and the value of `b[tp1]`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
