Output State: **`ans` is increased by `diff2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by `diff2`, while the values of `diff1` and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
