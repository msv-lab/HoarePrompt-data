Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2`). Additionally, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if the condition `diff1 > diff2` is true; otherwise, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`.
