Output State: **`ans` is still 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is still the absolute difference between the last processed element `i` and the last element of `b`; `item` is the tuple that was at the top of `max_heap` before popping. The third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff1` as the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the first element of `b`. The values of `ans`, `diff2`, `item`, and the condition about the third element of `item` remain unchanged.
