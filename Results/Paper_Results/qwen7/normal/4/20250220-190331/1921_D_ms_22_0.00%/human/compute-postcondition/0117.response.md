Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the `max_heap`. The values of `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, `i`, `b[0]`, and `b[m - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
