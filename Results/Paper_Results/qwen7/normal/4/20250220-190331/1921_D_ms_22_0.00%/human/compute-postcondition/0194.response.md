The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` has been decremented by some amount, but it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted because the problem specifies that the only condition for the loop to continue is `t > 0`.

State: **`ans` will be the sum of the adjustments made during each iteration, and `max_heap` will be empty, and `t` must be greater than 0**
