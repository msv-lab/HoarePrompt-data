Postcondition: `tp1` and `tp2` are indices, `diff1` and `diff2` are differences, `ans` is a cumulative value, `item` is an element from the `max_heap`, and `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap` are as described in the precondition. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1, `tp2` remains unchanged, `diff1` and `diff2` are recalculated, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, and `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap` remain as in the precondition. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `tp1` remains unchanged, `ans` is increased by the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2` plus the negative of `item[1]`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, and `diff1` and `diff2` are recalculated as described.
