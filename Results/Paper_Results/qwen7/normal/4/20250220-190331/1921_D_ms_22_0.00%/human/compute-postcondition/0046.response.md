Postcondition: **`diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` is either 0 or 1, `tp2` is either `m - 2` or `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])` if the if condition is false.**
