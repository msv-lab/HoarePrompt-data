Output State: **`diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing one tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2` is true, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code pushes a new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. This tuple is added regardless of whether `diff1` is greater than or less than `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
