Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. Since `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, the tuple added to the heap is `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
