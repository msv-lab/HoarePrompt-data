Output State: **`diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`**.

This means that `diff2` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The value of `diff1` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.
