Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `ans` remains 0, and `max_heap` contains a series of tuples where each tuple consists of `-max(diff1, diff2)`, `i`, and either 0 or `m-1`. The value of `i` in each tuple is an element from the list `a`, and `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `i` and `b[0]` and `b[m-1]`, respectively. The tuples are pushed into `max_heap` based on which difference (`diff1` or `diff2`) is larger.**

This means that after all iterations, `max_heap` will contain elements from `a` paired with their respective maximum distance from `b[0]` or `b[m-1]`, sorted by these maximum distances in descending order due to the negative sign used in pushing elements onto the heap.
