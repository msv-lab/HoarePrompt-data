Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(next_i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff1, i, 0)` and the original elements `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, next_i, m - 1)` are pushed into the heap.**

Explanation: The code pushes the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the max heap. The values of `ans`, `diff1`, `diff2`, and `next_i` remain unchanged. The original elements in the heap might be either `(-diff1, next_i, 0)` or `(-diff2, next_i, m - 1)`, but now `(-diff1, i, 0)` is also part of the heap.
