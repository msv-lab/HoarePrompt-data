Output State: **`b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` is empty, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `ans` is 0.**

The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `max_heap`, `t`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
