Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `b` is updated to be sorted.
