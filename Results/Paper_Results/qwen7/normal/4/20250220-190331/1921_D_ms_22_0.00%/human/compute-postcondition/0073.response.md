Postcondition: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by either the negative of `item[1]` plus the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, or the negative of `item[1]` depending on whether `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. If `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
