Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is equal to `m - 1`, `tp2` is equal to 0, and `ans` is 0.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged except that `ans` is initialized to 0 because no iterations have occurred yet.
