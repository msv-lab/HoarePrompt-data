Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the values in `b` are not sorted after reading them. According to the problem description, the values in `b` should be sorted before using them to calculate the maximum difference. However, the program sorts `b` only once and then uses it throughout the entire process without re-sorting it if new elements are added to the heap or if the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` move beyond the current bounds of the sorted segment of `b`.

Consider the following input:
```
3 6
1 2 3
6 5 4 3 2 1
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly calculate the differences because `b` is not properly managed to ensure it always represents the smallest and largest remaining values. The correct approach would involve re-sorting `b` whenever necessary to maintain the smallest and largest values within the current bounds.

Since the program does not correctly manage the sorting of `b`, it fails to provide the correct maximum difference for some inputs, making the program incorrect.
