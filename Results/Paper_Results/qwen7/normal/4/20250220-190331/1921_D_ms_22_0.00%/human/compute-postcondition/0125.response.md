Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` pushes the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` into the `max_heap`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
