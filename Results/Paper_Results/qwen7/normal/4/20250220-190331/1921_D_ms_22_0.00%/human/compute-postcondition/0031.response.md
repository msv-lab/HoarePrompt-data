Postcondition: **`diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples where the first element is either `-diff1` or `-diff2` depending on whether `diff1 > diff2` is true or false, the second element is `i`, and the third element is either `0` or `m - 1`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
