Postcondition: `ans` is adjusted based on the value of `item[2]` relative to `tp1` and `tp2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is set to either `diff1` (the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) or `diff2` (the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`), with appropriate updates to `tp1` and `tp2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2-1]`, then `ans` is set to `0 - item[0]`, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1.
