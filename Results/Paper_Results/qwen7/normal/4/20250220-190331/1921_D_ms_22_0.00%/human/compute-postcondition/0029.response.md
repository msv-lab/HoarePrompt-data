Output State: **`diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing two tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto the heap `max_heap`. The values of `diff1`, `i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, and `diff2` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new tuple to `max_heap`.
