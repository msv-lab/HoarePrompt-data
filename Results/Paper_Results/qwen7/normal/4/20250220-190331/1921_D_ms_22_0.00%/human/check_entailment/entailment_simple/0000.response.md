Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. The array `b` is sorted in ascending order, which is necessary for calculating the maximum difference.
4. A max heap is used to store the differences between elements of `a` and the closest elements in `b` that maximize the difference.
5. During the calculation, the program ensures that the chosen elements from `b` are not reused by adjusting the indices `tp1` and `tp2`.
6. The final result `ans` is computed correctly by summing up the differences stored in the max heap.
7. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
