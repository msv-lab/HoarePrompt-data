Output State: **`ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto the `max_heap`. Since `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, the tuple added to the heap is `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`. The heap is a data structure that maintains the elements in a specific order, typically used for priority queue operations. Here, the first element of the tuple is negated, which means the heap will prioritize based on the value of `diff2` in descending order. The other variables (`ans`, `diff1`, `i`, `b`, `m`) remain unchanged.
