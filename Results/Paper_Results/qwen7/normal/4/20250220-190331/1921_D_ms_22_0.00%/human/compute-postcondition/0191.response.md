Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either the maximum of `diff1` (absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) and `diff2` (absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` or `b[tp2-1]` depending on the condition); `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`; if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `ans` remains unchanged from the increase by the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`; otherwise, `ans` is further decreased by 1.
