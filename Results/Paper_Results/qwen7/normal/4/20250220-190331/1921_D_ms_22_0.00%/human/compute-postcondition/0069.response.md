Output State: **`tp1` is increased by 1.**

The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. All other variables remain in their initial states as no operations were performed on them. Therefore, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, and `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap` (which is still the highest value element that was popped from an empty heap, i.e., undefined or None). However, since the question asks to include only the updated value and the precondition that remains valid, we focus on `tp1`.
