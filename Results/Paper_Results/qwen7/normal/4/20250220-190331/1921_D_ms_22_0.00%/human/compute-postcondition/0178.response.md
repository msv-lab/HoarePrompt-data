Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` to `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `diff2` is now defined, while `max_heap`, `item`, and `diff1` retain their original values.
