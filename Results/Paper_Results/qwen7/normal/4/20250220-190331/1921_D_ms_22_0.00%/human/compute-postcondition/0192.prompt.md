Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` remains 0, and `max_heap` contains a series of tuples where each tuple consists of `-max(diff1, diff2)`, `i`, and either 0 or `m-1`. The value of `i` in each tuple is an element from the list `a`, and `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `i` and `b[0]` and `b[m-1]`, respectively. The tuples are pushed into `max_heap` based on which difference (`diff1` or `diff2`) is larger.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is adjusted based on the value of `item[2]` relative to `tp1` and `tp2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is set to either `diff1` (the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) or `diff2` (the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`), with appropriate updates to `tp1` and `tp2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2-1]`, then `ans` is set to `0 - item[0]`, and if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2`). Additionally, if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 if the condition `diff1 > diff2` is true; otherwise, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0] - 1`. `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either the maximum of `diff1` (absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) and `diff2` (absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` or `b[tp2-1]` depending on the condition); `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`; if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `ans` remains unchanged from the increase by the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`; otherwise, `ans` is further decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
