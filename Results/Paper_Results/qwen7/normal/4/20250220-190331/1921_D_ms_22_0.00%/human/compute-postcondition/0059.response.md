Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` pops and returns the smallest element from the `max_heap`. Since `max_heap` is non-empty before the execution, after executing this line, `max_heap` will become empty, and the variable `item` will hold the value of the smallest element that was previously in `max_heap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
