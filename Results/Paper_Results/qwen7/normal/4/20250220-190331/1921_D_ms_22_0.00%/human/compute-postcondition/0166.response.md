Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on the condition. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `ans` is increased by `diff1` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2`, and `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, while `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`.
