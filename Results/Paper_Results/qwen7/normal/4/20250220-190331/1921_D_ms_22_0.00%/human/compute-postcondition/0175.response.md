Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2`).
- If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then:
  - `tp1` is incremented by 1 if the condition `diff1 > diff2` is true.
  - Otherwise, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2-1]`.
- If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0] - 1`.
- `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.

### Loop Condition:
```
while max_heap:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the state of `max_heap`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must not be empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
