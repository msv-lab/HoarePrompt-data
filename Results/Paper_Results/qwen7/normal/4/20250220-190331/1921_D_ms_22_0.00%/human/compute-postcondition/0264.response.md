Output State: **`tp1` is incremented by 1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`**.

This means that `tp1` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables retain their previous states. The value of `diff1` now depends on the updated `tp1`.
