Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples where the first element is either `-diff1` or `-diff2` depending on whether `diff1 > diff2` is true or false, the second element is each `i` from the list `a`, and the third element is either `0` or `m - 1`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, `max_heap` will contain a tuple for each element in list `a`. Each tuple in `max_heap` will have the form `(-diff, i, index)`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `m - 1` (if `diff1 <= diff2`). The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is non-empty (but now the top item has been popped), `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the condition of `item[2]`, `ans` is the sum of `diff1` and `diff2` if `item[2]` is not within `[tp1, tp2]`, otherwise `ans` is `-item[0]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 99, `n` and `m` are the first and second integers entered respectively, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is empty, `item` is the highest value element that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by either the negative of `item[1]` plus the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2` (where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1] + 1`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`), or simply the negative of `item[1]` depending on whether `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`, `tp2` is decremented by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` are as follows: if `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly, `ans` is updated based on the minimum of `diff1` and `diff2` plus the negative of `item[1]` or just `diff1`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1 or 2. If the condition is not met, `ans` is increased by the negative of `item[1]`, `item` is no longer in `max_heap`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1, `tp2` is decremented by 2 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
