Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is 1 if the first three elements of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`) all have odd remainders when divided by 2, otherwise `cnt` remains 0.
