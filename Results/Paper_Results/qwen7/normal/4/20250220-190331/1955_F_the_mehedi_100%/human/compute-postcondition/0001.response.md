Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
