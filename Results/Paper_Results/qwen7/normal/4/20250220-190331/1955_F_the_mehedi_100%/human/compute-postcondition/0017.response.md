Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in `a`.

The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.

Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we know that `cnt` is the result of summing up the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of math.floor(x / 2) for each element x in the list a)**
