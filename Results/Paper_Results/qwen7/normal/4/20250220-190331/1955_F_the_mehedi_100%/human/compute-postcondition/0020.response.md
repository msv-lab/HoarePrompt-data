Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers converted from space-separated inputs, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This means that regardless of the initial value of `cnt` (which was the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the updated list `a`), it is now set to 0. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
