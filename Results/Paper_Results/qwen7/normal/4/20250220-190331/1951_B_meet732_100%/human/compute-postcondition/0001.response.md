Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and 1 <= k <= n where k is the index of the cow owned by the user; x is the integer at index k in list a.**

The code initializes an empty list `ind`. The values of `a` and `k` remain unchanged, and `x` retains its original value as the integer at index `k` in list `a`.
