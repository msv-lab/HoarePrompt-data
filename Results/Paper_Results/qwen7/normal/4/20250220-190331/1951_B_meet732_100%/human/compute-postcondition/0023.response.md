Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `ind` is a list containing the value 2.**

The code `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `ind`. Since `i` was initially 2 and `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not affected by this line of code), the updated state includes `ind` now being a list that contains the value 2.
