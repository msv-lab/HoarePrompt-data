Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns n - 1 if i is set to n-1. It returns k - 1 if k is the index stored in the first element of the list `ind`, which is 0 since the length of `ind` is exactly 1. It returns the first element of the list `ind` minus 1 if `ind` contains exactly one index greater than `k` and not 0, and this index is the only position in the list where the corresponding element of `a` is greater than `x`. It returns the maximum value between k - ind[0] and ind[0] - 1 if ind[0] is the first element of the list `ind`, which contains all indices where a[i] > x, and the length of `ind` is exactly 1, with the first element being 0 or less than or equal to k. It returns the minimum value between the second element of the list `ind` decremented by 1 and `k` decremented by 1 if the length of `ind` is exactly 2. It returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]) if the length of `ind` is exactly 2. It returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]) if the length of `ind` is exactly 1 and the first element is greater than k.**
