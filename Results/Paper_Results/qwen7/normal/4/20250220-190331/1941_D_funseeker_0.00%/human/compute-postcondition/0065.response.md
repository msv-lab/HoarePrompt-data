Output State: **`ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?', `r` is assigned the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is assigned the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.

This means that the function `func_1()` returns two values, which are split into `r` and `c`. The value of `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and the value of `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. The values of `ans`, `temp`, `q`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
