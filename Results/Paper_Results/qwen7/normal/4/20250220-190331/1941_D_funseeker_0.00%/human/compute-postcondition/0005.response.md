Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `r` to an integer, `c` remains the same string obtained from splitting the return value of `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty set named `temp`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `r`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while adding that `temp` is now an empty set.
