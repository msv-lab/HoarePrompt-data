Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is `(q + r) % n); `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since the last element in `ans` is also `(q + r) % n`, the set `ans` remains unchanged. The set `temp` now includes the new element.
