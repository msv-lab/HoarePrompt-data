### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined using `lru_cache`, but they are not used within the main function `func_4`. This is unnecessary for the current problem and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` converts the read line to an integer.
   - `func_3()` reads a line, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list.
   - In `func_4()`, these functions are used to read the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.

3. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`0` for clockwise, `1` for counterclockwise, and `?` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the position `0` is in the set, it replaces it with `n` (since index `0` corresponds to `n` in a 0-indexed array).
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the list of those players.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements.
   - It correctly accounts for the unknown direction (`?`) by considering both possibilities.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the ball wraps around the circle correctly.
   - The final handling of `0` replacing `n` is correct for 1-based indexing.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`), ensuring that both possible positions are considered.
   - The code correctly handles the wrap-around condition using modulo operation.

6. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the requirements, providing the number of possible players and their indices.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and follows the specified rules for determining the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
