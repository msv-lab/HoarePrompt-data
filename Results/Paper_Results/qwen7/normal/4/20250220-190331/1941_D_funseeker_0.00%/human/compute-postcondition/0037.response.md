Output State: **`ans` contains the elements of the set `temp`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`**.

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` initializes `temp` as an empty set. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `q`, `r`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. The only change is that `temp` is now an empty set.
