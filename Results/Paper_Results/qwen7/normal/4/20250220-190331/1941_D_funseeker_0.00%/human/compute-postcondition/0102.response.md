Based on the initial state provided:

- The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements after the loop executes all its iterations.
- If `0` is present in `ans`, then `ans` will also contain the element `n`.
- Otherwise, `0` is not in `ans`.

The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the set `ans`.

Given that `ans` contains \(2^m - 1\) elements, the length of `ans` is exactly \(2^m - 1\).

Output: **2^m - 1**
