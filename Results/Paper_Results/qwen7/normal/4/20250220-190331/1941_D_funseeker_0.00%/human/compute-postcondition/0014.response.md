Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, the value of `c` is either '1' or '?'.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is equal to `x`, the new value added to `temp` is `(x - r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `ans` still contains `x`, `q` is still `x`, and `temp` now includes both `(x + r) % n` and `(x - r) % n`. The value of `c` remains either '1' or '?'.
