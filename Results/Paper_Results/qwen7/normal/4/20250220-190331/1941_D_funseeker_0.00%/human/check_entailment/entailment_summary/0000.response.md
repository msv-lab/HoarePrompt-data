Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Reads an integer from standard input using `func_1()`.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into parts, and converts those parts to integers, returning a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: Processes the game logic as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the transitions based on the direction of the throws and updates the set of possible players who could have the ball.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem involves simulating a game where a ball is thrown between players in a circle. The direction of the throw can be specified or unknown ('?'). The goal is to determine the possible players who could have the ball after a series of throws.

3. **Function `func_4()` Behavior**:
   - It correctly initializes the set of possible players with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates through each throw, updating the set of possible players based on whether the throw was clockwise (`0` or `?`) or counterclockwise (`1` or `?`).
   - It handles the case where the direction is unknown by considering both possible directions.
   - It correctly adjusts for the modulo operation to handle circular indexing.
   - It ensures that player `0` is replaced with player `n` if present in the set of possible players.
   - It outputs the correct number of possible players and their indices.

Given the detailed analysis, the implementation of `func_4()` matches the requirements of the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
