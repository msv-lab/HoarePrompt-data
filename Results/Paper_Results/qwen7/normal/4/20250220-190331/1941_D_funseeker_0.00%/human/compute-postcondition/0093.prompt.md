Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `r` is assigned the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is assigned the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is `(q + r) % n`. If the current value of `c` is '1' or '?', the last element remains unchanged. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', the last element in `ans` is still `(q + r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', the last element in `ans` is `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` does not contain any additional elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
