Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n`, and `((x + r) % n + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds `((q + r) % n)` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is equal to `x`, `((q + r) % n)` simplifies to `((x + r) % n)`. This value is already present in `temp`, so adding it again does not change the set `temp`. The values of `ans` and `q` remain unchanged.
