Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `r` to an integer, `c` remains the same string obtained from splitting the return value of `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, regardless of whether `c` is '1' or '?'.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, the set `ans` will always contain the integer `x`, `q` will always be equal to `x`, and `temp` will always contain both `(x + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, irrespective of the value of `c` being '1' or '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, and `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and `(x + r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, `(x + r) % n`, and `((x + r) % n + r) % n`, and if `c` is '1' or '?', then `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
