Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in ans:`. The only variable in the loop head is `q`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the set `ans`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`).
   - `temp` is a set that now includes five elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and three instances of `(q + r) % n`.
   - `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.
   - `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`.
   - `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?'.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, at the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the next element in `ans`.
   - The set `ans` will lose the current `q` since it has been processed.
   - The set `temp` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `ans` must contain at least one element, but it will no longer include the current `q`.
   - `temp` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (excluding the current `q`), `temp` is a set that now includes five elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and three instances of `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?'**.
