Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, and the last element in the set `ans` is (q - r) % n. If the current value of `c` is '0' or '?', the last element remains unchanged. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the last element in `ans` is still (q - r) % n.**

Explanation: The code adds a new element `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `ans` is derived from `temp`, the last element in `ans` changes to `(q - r) % n`. The conditions regarding the value of `c` remain the same as they are not affected by this operation.
