Output State: **`ans` is a set containing the integer `x`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and `(x + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is equal to `x`, the expression simplifies to `(x - r) % n`. The other elements in `temp` remain unchanged, so they are still `(x + r) % n` and `(x + r) % n`. The variables `ans` and `q` are not affected by this operation.
