### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer.
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()` and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the output of `func_1()`.

2. **Main Function (`func_4()`):**
   - `func_4()` initializes the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It uses a set `ans` initialized with the initial player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and direction `c` using `func_1().split()`.
   - It updates the set `ans` by considering both possible directions (`0` for clockwise and `1` for counterclockwise) and handling the unknown direction `?`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - For each player `q` in `ans`, it calculates the new positions `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` and adds these to a temporary set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all throws, if `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` because the modulo operation ensures that `0` is equivalent to `n` in the context of circular indexing.
   - The size of `ans` is printed, which should be \(2^m - 1\), and the elements of `ans` are printed.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, including the unknown direction `?`.
   - The set operations ensure that all possible positions of the ball are considered.
   - The final adjustments ensure that `0` is treated as `n` in the context of the circular arrangement.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
