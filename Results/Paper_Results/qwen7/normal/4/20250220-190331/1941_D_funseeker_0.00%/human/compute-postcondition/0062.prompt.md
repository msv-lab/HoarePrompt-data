Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` contains the elements of the set `temp`, `q` is `x`, `temp` is an empty set, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `q` is `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'.

This means that regardless of whether `c` is '1' or '?', the sets `ans` and `temp` will include the necessary elements, and the values of `q`, `r`, and `c` will be as specified, with `c` being either '1' or '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes five elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and three instances of `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and its current value is either '1' or '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (excluding the current `q`), `temp` is a set that now includes seven elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and five instances of `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
