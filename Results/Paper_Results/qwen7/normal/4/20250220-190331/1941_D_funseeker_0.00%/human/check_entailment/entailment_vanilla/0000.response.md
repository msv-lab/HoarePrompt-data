Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**: The program defines several functions using `lru_cache` to cache results, but these are not used in the main function `func_4`. This suggests they might be intended for other purposes, but they are not necessary for solving the current problem.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input.
   - `func_2()` converts the read line to an integer.
   - `func_3()` reads a line, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list.

3. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`0` for clockwise, `1` for counterclockwise, and `?` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the position `0` is in the set, it replaces it with `n` (since index `0` corresponds to `n` in a 0-indexed array).
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the list of those players.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements.
   - It correctly accounts for the unknown direction (`?`) by considering both possibilities.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the ball wraps around the circle correctly.
   - The final handling of `0` replacing `n` is correct for 1-based indexing.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
