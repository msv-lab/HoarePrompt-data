Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State
- `ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements.
- The elements in `ans` consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\).
- `q` is the last element in the set `ans`.
- `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `r` is assigned the first value returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `c` is assigned the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.
- `temp` is an empty set.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for q in ans:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `q` is being used in the loop head.
- The loop will iterate over each element in the set `ans`.

### States to Adjust
- Since `q` is the loop variable, its initial value must be such that it can be part of the set `ans` and the loop can start executing.
- We need to ensure that `ans` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion
- The state of `ans` must be adjusted to ensure it contains at least one element.
- The values of `q`, `r`, and `c` do not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as `ans` is non-empty.

### Final State
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the last element in the set `ans`**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with at least one value for `q`.
