Output State: **`ans` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } temp - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `r` is assigned the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is assigned the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes `temp` as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `q`, `r`, `c`, or the split operation from `func_1()`. After executing the code, `temp` becomes an empty set. All other variables retain their previous values and relationships.
