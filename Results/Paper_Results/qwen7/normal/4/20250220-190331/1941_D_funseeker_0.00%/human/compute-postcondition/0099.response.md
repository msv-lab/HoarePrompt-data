Output State: **The set `ans` will contain a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements after the loop executes all its iterations, excluding the element `0`. Each element in `ans` will be derived from the initial `x` through a series of additions and subtractions modulo `n`, based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration.**

Explanation: The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans`. Since the initial set `ans` contains a total of \(2^m - 1\) elements, and `0` was one of those elements, after executing this line, `0` is no longer part of the set `ans`. All other elements remain unchanged.
