Output State: **`start_year` is ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x], `x` is 0, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The variable `start_year` is updated to the value of `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 0, `start_year` is used in the calculation, but its initial value is not specified. The value of `x` remains 0, the length of the `nums` list is unchanged, and `nums` itself is not altered.
