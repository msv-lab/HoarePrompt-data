Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for x in range(0, len(nums)):` statement. The variables involved here are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start_year` is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `len(nums)` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of the list `nums`, which does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`start_year` is \(((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]\), `x` is 2, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**
