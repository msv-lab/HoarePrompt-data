Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `start_year` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `start_year`. This assignment does not affect the values of `num_tests`, `n`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new state of `start_year` is `0`.
