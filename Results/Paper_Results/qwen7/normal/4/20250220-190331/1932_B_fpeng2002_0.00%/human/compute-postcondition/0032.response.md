Output State: **`num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]**.

Explanation: The code takes an input from the user, splits it into individual integers, and stores them in the list `nums`. The length of `nums` is used to access its last element. The value of `start_year` is updated based on the formula provided, using the last element of the `nums` list. The `num_tests` and `n` variables remain unchanged except for `num_tests` being decreased by 1.
