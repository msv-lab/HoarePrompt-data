Output State: **`start_year` is \(((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]\), `x` is 1, `len(nums)` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` based on its current value and the value at index 1 of the `nums` list. Since the initial value of `start_year` is given as \((\left(\text{start_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[1] + 1) * \text{nums}[1]\), the new value of `start_year` remains the same as its initial value. The values of `x`, `len(nums)`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
