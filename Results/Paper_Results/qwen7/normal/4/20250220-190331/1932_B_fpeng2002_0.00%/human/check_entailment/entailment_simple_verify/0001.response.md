### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is used to track the current year.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: For each test case, it iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`).
4. **Year Calculation**: In the loop, it updates `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula aims to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

However, let's carefully analyze the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:

- The expression `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]` computes the quotient when `start_year + 1` is divided by `nums[x]`.
- Adding 1 to this quotient ensures that we get the smallest integer greater than or equal to `(start_year + 1) / nums[x]`.
- Multiplying this result by `nums[x]` gives us the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.

To verify this, consider the following example:

- Suppose `start_year = 0` and `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`.
- For the first iteration (sign 3):
  - `start_year = 0`
  - `(0 + 1) // 3 + 1 = 1 // 3 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `1 * 3 = 3`
  - So, `start_year` becomes 3.
- For the second iteration (sign 2):
  - `start_year = 3`
  - `(3 + 1) // 2 + 1 = 4 // 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `3 * 2 = 6`
  - So, `start_year` becomes 6.
- For the third iteration (sign 4):
  - `start_year = 6`
  - `(6 + 1) // 4 + 1 = 7 // 4 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `2 * 4 = 8`
  - So, `start_year` becomes 8.
- For the fourth iteration (sign 5):
  - `start_year = 8`
  - `(8 + 1) // 5 + 1 = 9 // 5 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `2 * 5 = 10`
  - So, `start_year` becomes 10.
- For the fifth iteration (sign 9):
  - `start_year = 10`
  - `(10 + 1) // 9 + 1 = 11 // 9 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `2 * 9 = 18`
  - So, `start_year` becomes 18.
- For the sixth iteration (sign 18):
  - `start_year = 18`
  - `(18 + 1) // 18 + 1 = 19 // 18 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - `2 * 18 = 36`
  - So, `start_year` becomes 36.

This matches the expected output of 36.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the year when all signs will occur sequentially according to the given periodicities.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
