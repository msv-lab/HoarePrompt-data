Output State: **`num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]**.

Explanation: The line `num_tests -= 1` decreases the value of `num_tests` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `start_year`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The expression for updating `start_year` is preserved as it was in the initial state.
