Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the alternating pattern of attacks on the first and last ships. Instead of decrementing the durability of the ships according to the Kraken's pattern, the function simply checks if the cumulative durability of the first `a` and last `b` ships is less than or equal to the respective attack counts `a` and `b`. This approach does not account for the fact that ships sink and are no longer subject to further attacks once their durability reaches zero.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program incorrectly counts the number of ships that would sink without properly simulating the Kraken's attacks. The correct implementation should maintain a list of ships and simulate the attacks iteratively, updating the durability of the ships and removing them from consideration once they sink.
