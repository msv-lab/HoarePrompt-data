### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a series of ships with varying durability. The Kraken attacks in a specific pattern: first the first ship, then the last, and so on. The goal is to determine how many ships sink after `k` attacks.

2. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The logic for determining when a ship sinks.
   - The handling of the Kraken's attacks in the specified pattern.
   - The calculation of the number of ships sunk based on the total attacks `k`.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`T`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships (`n`), the number of attacks (`k`), and the durability of each ship (`nums`).
   - It calls the function `func_1` to compute the number of ships sunk.
   - In `func_1`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, all ships will sink, and it returns `n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of attacks on the first half and the second half of the ships separately.
   - It sums up the number of ships that can withstand the attacks from both sides and returns this value.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for counting the number of ships that can withstand the attacks seems flawed. Specifically, the current implementation incorrectly counts the number of ships that can survive based on partial sums of durability.
   - The correct approach should simulate the attacks directly rather than using partial sums.

5. **Detailed Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to count the number of ships that can withstand the attacks by splitting the list into two halves and checking the cumulative sums. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not simulate the actual sequence of attacks.
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the alternating pattern of attacks correctly. Instead, it tries to determine how many ships can withstand the attacks by comparing cumulative sums, which is not equivalent to the actual attack sequence.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly simulate the attacks, we need to iterate through the list of ships and decrement their durability according to the attack pattern. We should keep track of which ships are still active and adjust the count of attacks accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and thus is incorrect. The function `func_1` uses an incorrect method to determine the number of ships that can withstand the attacks.

**Final: False**
