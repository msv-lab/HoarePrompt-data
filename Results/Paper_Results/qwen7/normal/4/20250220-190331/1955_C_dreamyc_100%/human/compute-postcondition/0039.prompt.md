You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5.
    #State: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of nums is greater than k.
    a, b = math.ceil(k / 2), k // 2
    ans = 0
    s_a = 0
    s_b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        s_a += nums[i]
        
        s_b += nums[n - i - 1]
        
        if s_a <= a:
            ans += 1
        
        if s_b <= b:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is the sum of `1` for every `i` from `0` to `n-1` where `s_a` (which is the cumulative sum of `nums[i]` from `0` to `i`) is less than or equal to `a` and `s_b` (which is the cumulative sum of `nums[n-i-1]` from `n-1` to `n-i-1`) is less than or equal to `b`. `s_b` is the cumulative sum of `nums[n-i-1]` from `n-1` to `0`, and `i` is `n`. `s_a` is the cumulative sum of `nums[i]` from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans` will be the count of indices `i` where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`. The variable `s_b` will hold the sum of all elements in `nums`, and `i` will be equal to `n` after all iterations.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (`math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (`k // 2`).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (math.ceil(k / 2)) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (k // 2).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5.

Case_2: The program returns `ans`, which is the count of indices `i` (from `0` to `n-1`) where the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (`math.ceil(k / 2)`) and the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (`k // 2`).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
