Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is math.ceil(k / 2), `b` is k // 2, `ans` is 1, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `s_a` is `nums[0]`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, `ans` is set to 1.
