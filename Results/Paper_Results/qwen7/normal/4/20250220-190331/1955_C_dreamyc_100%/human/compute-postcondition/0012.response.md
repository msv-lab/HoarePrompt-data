Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is math.ceil(k / 2), `b` is k // 2, `ans` is 1, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `s_a` is `nums[0]`.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
