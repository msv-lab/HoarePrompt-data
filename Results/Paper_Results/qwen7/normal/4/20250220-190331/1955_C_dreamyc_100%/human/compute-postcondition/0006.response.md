Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is math.ceil(k / 2), `b` is k // 2, `ans` is 0, `s_b` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `s_b = 0` initializes the variable `s_b` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
