Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 5, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 5] + nums[n - 7]`, `i` is 6, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[5]` if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as `ans` is 3, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 5] + nums[n - 7]`, `i` is 6, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[5]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 4, after executing this line, `ans` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
