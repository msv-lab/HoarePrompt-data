Output State: **`a` must not be empty, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `x` the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` (`x[-1]`) and the first element of `a` (`i`). Since `i` is the first element of `a`, the output state includes the updated `x` list with this new element.
