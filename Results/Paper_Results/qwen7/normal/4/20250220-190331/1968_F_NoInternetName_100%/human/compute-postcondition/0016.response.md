Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `x` is initialized as `[0]`.
- `inds` is an empty dictionary.
- `a` is a list of elements.
- `q` is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

### Loop Head:
- The loop iterates over `range(q)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `q-1`.

### Loop Body:
- The loop body is omitted, but based on the problem description, the loop will perform cumulative XOR operations on the list `a` and update the lists `x` and `inds` accordingly.

### Adjusting States:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` will start from `0` and increment until `q-1`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `0`.

2. **List `x`:**
   - Initially, `x` is `[0]`. The loop will update this list to store cumulative XOR results.
   - After the loop, `x` will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`, starting from `0`.

3. **Dictionary `inds`:**
   - Initially, `inds` is an empty dictionary. It will map each value in `x` (excluding the initial `0`) to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`.

4. **List `a`:**
   - `a` is a list of elements that the loop will use to perform XOR operations. However, since `a` is not being modified within the loop, its state does not need to be adjusted.

5. **Variable `q`:**
   - `q` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. It must be a positive integer.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to initialize `i` to `0` and ensure `q` is a positive integer. The initial state of `x` and `inds` will be adjusted during the loop execution.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `q` must be a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary**
