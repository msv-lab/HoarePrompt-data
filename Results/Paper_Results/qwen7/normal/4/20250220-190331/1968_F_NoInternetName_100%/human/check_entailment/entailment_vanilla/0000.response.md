### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, the subarray can always be divided into equal parts with XOR zero.
   - For non-zero XOR values, we need to check if there exists a split point where the XOR of the left and right parts match the overall XOR value.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function reads and splits input data.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function performs binary search.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is essentially a wrapper for `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** This function is another wrapper for `func_2` with an additional offset.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** This function processes the main logic for each test case and query.

4. **Main Logic in `func_5`:**
   - **Initialization:** 
     - Read `n` and `q`.
     - Read the array `a` and compute the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Store indices of each unique XOR value in `inds`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query, check if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - If not, use binary search to find potential split points.
     - Check if the split points allow for valid divisions.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code uses binary search to find split points, which is efficient but might not handle edge cases correctly.
   - The logic for checking split points seems overly complex and might not cover all scenarios.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code appears to follow the problem's requirements.
   - However, the binary search approach might not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when dealing with non-zero XOR values.

### Conclusion:

After careful analysis, the provided code seems to follow the problem's requirements and logic, but there might be edge cases where it fails. Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, the code is likely correct in its approach but might need further refinement for edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
