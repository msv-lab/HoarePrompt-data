Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `lower` is 0. The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is checked. If the condition is true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the condition is false, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.**
