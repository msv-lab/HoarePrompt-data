Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)`**.

This means that the function `func_1(int)` has been called twice, and the results of these calls are assigned to `l` and `r`, respectively. The values of `i`, `q`, `x`, and `inds` remain unchanged from their initial states.
