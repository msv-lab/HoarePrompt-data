Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `lower` is 0, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]**.

Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.
- The variable `q` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer.
- The variable `x` remains unchanged and is still [0].
- The variable `inds` remains an empty dictionary.
- The variable `lower` is initially defined as `inds[x[r]][0]` if `inds[x[r]]` is not empty and the first element is less than `l`, otherwise `lower` is 0. Since `inds` is an empty dictionary, `inds[x[r]]` does not exist, so `lower` is set to 0.
- The variable `upper` is assigned the value `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. However, since `inds` is an empty dictionary, `inds[x[l - 1]]` does not exist, so `upper` is undefined in this context. But based on the given information, we can only state that `upper` is defined as per the expression provided.
