Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]**, and `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`.

Explanation:
- The code assigns `upper` the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. Since `x` is `[0]`, `x[l - 1]` (where `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`) refers to `0`.
- Therefore, `upper` is calculated as `inds[0][func_3(inds[0], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`.
- The value of `lower` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. It is still `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`, which translates to `inds[0][func_4(inds[0], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]` since `x[r]` also refers to `0`.

All other variables (`i`, `q`, `inds`, `l`, and `r`) remain in their initial states as no operations were performed on them.
