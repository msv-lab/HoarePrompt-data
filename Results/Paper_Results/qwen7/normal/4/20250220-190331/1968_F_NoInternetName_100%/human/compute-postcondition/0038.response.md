Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `q` is a positive integer
- `x` is a list containing a single element 0
- `inds` is an empty dictionary
- `lower` is 0
- `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]

Let's break down the expression for `upper`:

1. `x[l - 1]` refers to the last element of the list `x`. Since `x` contains only one element 0, `x[l - 1]` is 0.
2. `inds[x[l - 1]]` is `inds[0]`. Since `inds` is an empty dictionary, `inds[0]` does not exist, and attempting to access it would result in a KeyError if this were in a real execution context. However, since we are asked to determine what will be printed and not handle errors, we should consider the logical flow.
3. `func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` would attempt to call `func_3` with `inds[0]` and a lambda function. Again, since `inds[0]` does not exist, this would also result in a KeyError. But for the purpose of determining the output, we need to focus on the print statement itself.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('Yes')
```

The output will be a simple string "Yes".

Output: **Yes**
