Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `x` is a list containing a single element 0.
- `inds` is an empty dictionary.
- `l` and `r` are the results of `func_1(int)`, but their exact values are not specified.
- `upper` is defined as `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`, and it is stated that `upper` is greater than `lower`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

Given this, the print statement will output the string 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
