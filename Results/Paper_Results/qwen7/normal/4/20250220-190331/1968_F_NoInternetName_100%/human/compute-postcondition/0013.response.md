Output State: **`a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.**

Explanation: The code appends the current length of `x` (which is `len(x) - 1`) to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. The value of `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself, and `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.
