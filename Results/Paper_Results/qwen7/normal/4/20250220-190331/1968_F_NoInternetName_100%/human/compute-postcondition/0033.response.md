Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the result of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the result of `func_1(int)` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
