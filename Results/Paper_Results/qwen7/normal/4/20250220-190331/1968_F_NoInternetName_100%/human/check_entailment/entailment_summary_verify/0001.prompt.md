You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list `a` of integers and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it checks if the cumulative XOR of the sublist `a[l:r]` is zero. If the cumulative XOR is zero, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function also maintains a dictionary `inds` that tracks the indices of each unique cumulative XOR value in the list `x`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, the subarray can always be divided into equal parts with XOR zero.
   - For non-zero XOR values, we need to check if there exists a split point where the XOR of the left and right parts match the overall XOR value.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function reads and splits input data.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function performs binary search.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is essentially a wrapper for `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** This function is another wrapper for `func_2` with an additional offset.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** This function processes the main logic for each test case and query.

4. **Main Logic in `func_5`:**
   - **Initialization:** 
     - Read `n` and `q`.
     - Read the array `a` and compute the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Store indices of each unique XOR value in `inds`.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query, check if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - If not, use binary search to find potential split points.
     - Check if the split points allow for valid divisions.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code uses binary search to find split points, which is efficient but might not handle edge cases correctly.
   - The logic for checking split points seems overly complex and might not cover all scenarios.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code appears to follow the problem's requirements.
   - However, the binary search approach might not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when dealing with non-zero XOR values.

### Conclusion:

After careful analysis, the provided code seems to follow the problem's requirements and logic, but there might be edge cases where it fails. Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, the code is likely correct in its approach but might need further refinement for edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
