### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a space-separated sequence of strings from input and converts them to integers using the provided `cast` function.
   - It correctly parses the input for `n`, `q`, and the array elements for each test case.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the leftmost index where the predicate function returns `True`.
   - The function correctly narrows down the search range and returns the appropriate index or `None` if no such index exists.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function simply calls `func_2` and returns the result.
   - It is used to check if all elements in the list satisfy the predicate.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function calls `func_2` and returns the result incremented by one if `func_2` returns a non-None value.
   - It is used to get the index of the last occurrence of a specific value in the list.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function processes the array and handles the queries.
   - It constructs the cumulative XOR list `x` and the dictionary `inds` to track the indices of each unique cumulative XOR value.
   - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is zero.
     - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray is interesting, and it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it finds the indices of the last occurrence of `x[r]` before `l` and the first occurrence of `x[l-1]` up to `r` and checks if there is a valid split that makes the subarray interesting.
   - The logic in `func_5` is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Given that all functions work as intended and the overall logic in `func_5` correctly identifies interesting subarrays based on the problem description, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
