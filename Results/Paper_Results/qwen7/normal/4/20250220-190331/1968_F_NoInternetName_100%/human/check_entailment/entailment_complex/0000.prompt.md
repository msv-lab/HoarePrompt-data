Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a callable that can convert strings to integers, and the input is a space-separated sequence of integers representing the array elements or query ranges.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the 'cast' function to each element in the input string split by spaces. Each element is assumed to be a string representation of an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable parameter `cast` that converts strings to integers. It reads a space-separated sequence of strings from input, converts each string to an integer using the `cast` function, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean.
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `l` is either `mid` or 0, `r` is greater than `l + 1`, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`. If `predicate(arr[mid])` is true, then `l` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is updated to `mid`.
    #
    #This final state indicates that the loop continues to narrow down the search range by updating `l` and `r` based on the result of the predicate function applied to the middle element of the current range. The process repeats until the condition `l + 1 >= r` is met, meaning the search range has been reduced to a single element or the loop has determined that no element satisfies the predicate.
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns the updated value of `l`, which is now `(l + r) // 2`
    #State: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `l` is either `mid` or 0, `r` is greater than `l + 1`, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`. The predicate function `predicate(arr[mid])` is false, and `l` is 0 while `r` is updated to `mid`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It uses binary search to find the leftmost index where the predicate function returns `True`. If such an index exists, the function returns it; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns a boolean value determined by the function `func_2` applied to the list `arr` and the predicate function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function. It applies the predicate function to each element in `arr` and returns `True` if all elements satisfy the predicate, otherwise it returns `False`.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if (result is not None) :
        return result + 1
        #The program returns the value of `result` plus 1, where `result` is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)`
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `result` is None
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a list `arr` of integers and a predicate function `predicate`. It calls another function `func_2` with these arguments. If `func_2` returns a non-None value, the function returns that value incremented by one. If `func_2` returns None, the function returns None.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of integers where each element is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30. l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query.

    n, q = func_1(int)

    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`. After all iterations, the list `x` will contain the cumulative XOR results of all elements in `a`, starting from the initial value of `x` which is `[0]`. Specifically, `x` will be transformed as follows: `x[0] = 0`, and for each subsequent index `i`, `x[i]` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` up to the `i-1`th element. The dictionary `inds` will map each value in `x` (excluding the initial `0`) to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`.
    #
    #In natural language, after all iterations of the loop, the list `x` will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`, starting from 0, and `inds` will store the indices of each unique value in `x` that results from the XOR operations.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `i` is equal to `q`, `x` contains the cumulative XOR results of all elements in `a`, starting from 0. Specifically, `x[0]` is 0, and for each subsequent index `i`, `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` up to the `i-1`th element. `inds` is a dictionary that maps each unique value in `x` (excluding the initial `0`) to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of integers and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it checks if the cumulative XOR of the sublist `a[l:r]` is zero. If the cumulative XOR is zero, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function also maintains a dictionary `inds` that tracks the indices of each unique cumulative XOR value in the list `x`.
