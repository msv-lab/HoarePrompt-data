Output State: **`a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.**

Explanation: The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index of the last element in `x` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `i`, or `x` except for updating `inds[x[-1]]` with the new index. The rest of the conditions remain unchanged.
