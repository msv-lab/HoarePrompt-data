Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `q` is a positive integer, `x` is [0], `inds` is an empty dictionary, `lower` is 0, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]**.

Explanation: Since both the if and else parts of the if-else block have identical preconditions and postconditions, the overall postcondition remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `q`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`, and `upper` do not change regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.
