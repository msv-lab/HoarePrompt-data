Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `inds[0]` contains [0], `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `x` is a list containing a single element which is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` must not be empty, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` must not be empty and its first element must be the next element from the original list, `i` is the next element from `a`, `x` contains the first element of `x` appended with the result of `x[-1] ^ i` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1` and `x` is updated with `x[-1] ^ i` appended to itself.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
