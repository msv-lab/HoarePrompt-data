You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

#Function 3:

    return func_2(arr, predicate)

#Function 4:
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if result is not None:
        return result + 1
    return None

def func_5():
    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list `a` of integers and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it checks if the cumulative XOR of the sublist `a[l:r]` is zero. If the cumulative XOR is zero, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function also maintains a dictionary `inds` that tracks the indices of each unique cumulative XOR value in the list `x`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining if the subarray is interesting.

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `x` list. However, it does not correctly check if the subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of each part is equal.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are used to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions. These functions do not correctly handle the logic required to determine if the subarray is interesting.

3. **Predicate Functions**: The predicate functions used in the binary search do not correctly determine if the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 5
  1 1 2 3 0
  1 5
  2 4
  3 5
  1 3
  3 4
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  NO
  NO
  NO
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

This is incorrect because the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 0]` can be divided into `[1], [2, 3, 0]` with XOR values `1` and `1` respectively, making it interesting. Similarly, the subarray `[1, 1]` is also interesting.

The program fails to correctly identify these cases due to the incorrect implementation of the binary search and predicate functions.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
