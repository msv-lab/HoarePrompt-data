Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise. This function is correctly implemented and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to partition the input string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes. Let's analyze its logic:
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it prints "YES", "1", and `s`. This is correct because the entire string itself is a valid partition.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first non-matching character from the second position onwards (`s[i] != s[0]`). If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no non-matching character is found (i.e., `x == -1`), it prints "NO". This is also correct because if the entire string is a palindrome and no non-matching character is found, no valid partition exists.
   - If a non-matching character is found, it further checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False`). If true, it prints "YES", "2", and the two substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This is correct because these two substrings are non-palindromic.
   - If the substring starting from `x+1` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is either 1 or half the length of the string. If so, it prints "NO". This is correct because if `x` is 1 or half the length, the string cannot be split into two non-palindromic substrings without making one of them a palindrome.
   - If none of the above conditions hold, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This is correct because these two substrings are non-palindromic.

Given the analysis, the function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and handles all edge cases appropriately.

3. **Main Program Loop**: The main program loop calls `func_2()` for each test case, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Conclusion:
The given program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem statement and handles all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
