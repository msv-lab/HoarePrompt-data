Output State: **s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s, x is -1**

Explanation: The code assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n` and assigns `-1` to the variable `x`. The value of `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged from the initial state, while `x` is explicitly set to `-1`.
