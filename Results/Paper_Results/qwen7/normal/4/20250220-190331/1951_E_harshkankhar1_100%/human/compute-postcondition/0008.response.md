Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - The variable `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `x` is -1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` is True.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 1 and `n` being the length of the string `s`, we need to ensure these conditions are met.
   - The value of `x` and the result of `func_1(s[0:])` are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the input string `s`**
