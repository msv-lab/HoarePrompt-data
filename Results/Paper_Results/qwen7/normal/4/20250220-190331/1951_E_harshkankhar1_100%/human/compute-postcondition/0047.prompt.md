You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of the string s such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s
        return
        #The program does not return any value
    #State: s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s, x is -1, and func_1(s[0:]) is True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The value of `i` is `n-1`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: The value of `i` is `n-1`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Since the if condition `(x == -1)` is false, `x` is not -1 and there exists at least one non-matching character in the string `s`.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] [space] s[x + 1:]
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: the substring from the start of the string up to and including the index x + 1, followed by a space, and then the substring starting from the index x + 2 to the end of the string
        #State: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found, and `n` is the length of the input string `s`. If `x` is either 1 or half the length of the string `s`, then no change is made to `x`. Otherwise, `x` remains the index where the first non-matching character is found.
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found, and `n` is the length of the input string `s`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then no change is made to `x`. Otherwise, if `x` is either 1 or half the length of the string `s`, then no change is made to `x`. In all other cases, `x` remains the index where the first non-matching character is found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value. If it needs to indicate anything, it returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value

Case_2: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
