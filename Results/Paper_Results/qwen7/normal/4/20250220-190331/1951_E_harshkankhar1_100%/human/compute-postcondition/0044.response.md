Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `x` is the index where the first non-matching character is found, and `n` is the length of the input string `s`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then `x` remains the index where the first non-matching character is found. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, then `x` remains unchanged unless `x` is either 1 or half the length of the string `s`, in which case no change is made to `x`.
