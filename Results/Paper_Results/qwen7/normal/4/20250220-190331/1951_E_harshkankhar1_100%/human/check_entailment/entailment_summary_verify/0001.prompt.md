You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description:

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads an input string `s` and determines whether it can be split into two non-empty substrings such that both substrings are palindromes. If such a split exists, it prints "YES" followed by the indices or substrings involved in the split. If no such split exists, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:**
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is equal to its reverse (`s[::-1]`), otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function processes the input string `s` and determines if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself.
     - If `s` is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
       - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character.
       - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters are the same), it prints "NO".
       - If a different character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
         - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.
         - If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" (this condition seems unnecessary and might be a mistake).
         - Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Palindromic Strings:**
   - The logic for checking if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings is flawed.
   - The function only checks for the first differing character and does not ensure that the remaining substring is non-palindromic.
   - For example, the string "sinktheyacht" is correctly identified as non-palindromic, but the function should handle more complex cases like "lllllllll" or "uwuowouwu".

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings with repeated characters or strings that are not easily split into non-palindromic parts.
   - The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results.

3. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_2()` uses `input()` which is not defined in the context of a typical Python script. It should use `sys.stdin.readline()` or similar method for handling input in a competitive programming environment.

### Conclusion:

The given program is not correct because it fails to properly handle the partitioning logic and edge cases. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
