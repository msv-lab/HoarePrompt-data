Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the possibility of partitioning the string into more than two non-palindromic substrings.

For example, consider the input string `sinktheyacht`. According to the problem description, a valid partition could be `["sink", "theyacht"]` because neither substring is a palindrome. However, the current implementation only checks for partitions of size 1 or 2. It does not explore partitions of size greater than 2, which means it might incorrectly output `NO` for some valid cases.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Input:
```
sinktheyacht
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
2
sink theyacht
```

But the provided program might output:
```
NO
```

This is because the program does not attempt to partition the string into more than two parts. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
