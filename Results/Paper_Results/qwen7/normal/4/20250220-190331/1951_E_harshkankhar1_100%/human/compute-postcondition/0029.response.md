Postcondition: **The value of `i` is `n-1`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Since the if condition `(x == -1)` is false, `x` is not -1 and there exists at least one non-matching character in the string `s`.**
