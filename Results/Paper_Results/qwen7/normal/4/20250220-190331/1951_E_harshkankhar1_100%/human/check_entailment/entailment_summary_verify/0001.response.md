### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of these substrings are palindromes.
- If such a partition is possible, we print "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
- If no such partition is possible, we print "NO".

#### Function Summaries Recap:
1. **Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:**
   - Checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
   - Returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - Reads an input string `s`.
   - Determines if `s` can be split into two non-empty substrings such that both substrings are non-palindromic.
   - If such a split exists, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the substrings involved.
   - If no such split exists, it prints "NO".

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:
1. **Initial Check for Palindrome:**
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (1) and the string itself.
   - This part is correct and handles the simplest case where the entire string is non-palindromic.

2. **Finding First Non-Palindromic Substring:**
   - The function then looks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
   - If such a character is found, it sets `x` to the index of this character.
   - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters are the same), it prints "NO".
   - This part is also correct and handles the case where the string consists of the same character repeated.

3. **Further Partitioning:**
   - The function then checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.
   - If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO". This condition is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts (2) and the two substrings.
   - This part is incorrect because it does not ensure that the remaining substring is non-palindromic. It only checks for the first non-palindromic substring without considering the rest of the string.

#### Correctness of the Given Program:
- The function `func_2()` correctly handles the simplest cases where the entire string is non-palindromic or consists of the same character repeated.
- However, it fails to handle more complex cases where the string can be partitioned into multiple non-palindromic substrings.
- The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results.
- The function does not ensure that the remaining substring after finding the first non-palindromic substring is also non-palindromic.

Therefore, the given program is not correct because it fails to properly handle the partitioning logic and edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the analysis.
