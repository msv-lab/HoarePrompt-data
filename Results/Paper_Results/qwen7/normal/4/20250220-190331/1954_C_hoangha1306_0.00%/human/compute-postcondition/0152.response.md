The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is equal to `a[0]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is `0`, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `kq2` is equal to `a[0]` concatenated with `a[i]`.**
