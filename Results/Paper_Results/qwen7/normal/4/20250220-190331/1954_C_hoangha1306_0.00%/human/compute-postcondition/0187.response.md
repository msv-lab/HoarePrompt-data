Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is the concatenation of the string `a[0]` and the string representation of `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))` if `a[i] <= b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is the concatenation of the string `a[0]` and the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. `kq2` is the string `b[0]` concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[0] > b[0]`, otherwise `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `x`. `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.
