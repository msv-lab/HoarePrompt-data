Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`. The current value of `vt` is 0.**
