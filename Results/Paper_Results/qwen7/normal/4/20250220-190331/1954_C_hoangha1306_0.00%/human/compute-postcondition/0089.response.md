Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))**.

The value of `vt` has been explicitly set to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
