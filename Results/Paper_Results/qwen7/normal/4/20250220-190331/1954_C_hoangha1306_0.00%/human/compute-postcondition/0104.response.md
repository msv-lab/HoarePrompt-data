Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are constructed based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` is `a[i]` and `kq2` is `a[len(b) - 1]`. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq1` and the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` remains unchanged and `kq2` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`. `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`.**
