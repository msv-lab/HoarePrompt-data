Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `i` is 2, `vt` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `vt` is assigned the value 1, which does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, or `i`. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
