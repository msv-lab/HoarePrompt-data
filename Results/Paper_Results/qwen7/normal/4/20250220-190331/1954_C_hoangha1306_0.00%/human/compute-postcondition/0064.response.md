Output State: **`x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `i` is 2, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `str(y)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. Since `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, the value of `kq1` is updated accordingly. All other variables (`x`, `i`) remain unchanged.
