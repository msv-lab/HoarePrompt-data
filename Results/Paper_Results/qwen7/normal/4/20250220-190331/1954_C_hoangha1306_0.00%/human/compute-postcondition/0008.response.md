Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`.

2. **Determine the relevant variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. 

4. **Initial state before the loop**: 
   - `vt` is 0
   - `x` is a string representing an integer
   - `y` is a string representing an integer
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `q` is 0
   - `a` is an input string
   - `b` is an input integer
   - `kq1` is an empty string
   - `kq2` is an empty string

5. **Adjust the states**: 
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the loop).
   - `len(a)` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. Therefore, `a` must be a non-empty string to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty string**
