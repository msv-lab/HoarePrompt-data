Output State: **`i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `kq1` is a string containing `str(y)` appended to its end, `kq2` is an empty string concatenated with `str(x)`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates `str(x)` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` was initially an empty string, after executing the code, `kq2` becomes `str(x)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
