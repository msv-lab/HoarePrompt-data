Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The initial condition that `x` is an input integer is preserved, and now `y` is also an input integer.
