State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. The variable `x` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `x` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
4. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, as it is not used within the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `x` must be greater than 0.
