Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x` is an input integer**.

The code `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and its value is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The variable `x` now holds the integer input provided by the user.
