Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the requirement. The program reads `x` at the beginning and then uses this value in the loop, which is incorrect because it should read `x` and `y` for each test case separately within the loop. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each test case, it reads `x` and `y` correctly and prints the minimum followed by the maximum as required.
