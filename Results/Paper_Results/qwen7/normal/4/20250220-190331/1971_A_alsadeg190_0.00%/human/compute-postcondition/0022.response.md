Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is a value between 0 and x (inclusive), `x` is an integer from the input split on the last iteration of the loop, and `y` is an integer from the input split on the last iteration of the loop. Regardless of the condition in the loop, `x` and `y` retain their values from the last input provided.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will be the `x` value from the last input provided, and `y` will be the `y` value from the last input provided. The variable `i` will be equal to `x`, which is the total number of iterations the loop executed. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state.
