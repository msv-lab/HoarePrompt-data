Output State: **`x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. Since the exact values of the input are not specified, we can only say that `x` and `y` are integers resulting from the split and conversion of the input. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be unchanged.
