Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` for each test case, followed by the array elements `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because Alice will remove the smallest elements first to maximize the sum, and Bob will negate the smallest elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `pos` as an empty list, calculates the initial sum `s` of the array, and appends the value of `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` to `pos`. This represents the sum if Alice removes the smallest `k` elements and Bob negates the smallest `x` elements.
   - **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive). In each iteration:
     - It subtracts the current largest element from `s` and `s2`.
     - If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the array, it adds the next smallest element to `s2`.
     - It appends the new value of `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`.
   - **Return Statement**: The function returns the maximum value in `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after Alice and Bob make their moves.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum sum achievable after Alice and Bob play optimally.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
