Output State: **`i` is 2, `removals` must be at least 3, `s2` is updated to `s2` plus the second last element of `elements`, the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, and `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`.**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the `i`-th last element from `s`. Given that `i` was initially 3, `elements[-3]` refers to the third last element of `elements`. After executing the code, `i` is decremented by 1, making it 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
