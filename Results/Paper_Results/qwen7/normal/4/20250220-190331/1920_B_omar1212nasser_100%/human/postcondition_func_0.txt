The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list \( a \) in ascending order and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product based on these inputs. Finally, it prints the computed product for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each one.
