### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Input Reading and Sorting
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.
- It sorts the array `a`.

#### Optimal Strategy Calculation
- The program calls `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.

#### Calculation Logic in `func_2`
- The function initializes a list `pos` to store potential sums.
- It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
- It appends the sum after removing the last `x` elements (since Bob will negate these).

#### Handling Removals and Negations
- The function iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive) to consider different removal scenarios.
  - For each iteration, it updates the sum `s` by removing the largest remaining element.
  - It updates `s2` (sum of the last `x` elements) by removing the largest remaining element.
  - If there are enough remaining elements to negate, it adds back the negated value.
  - It appends the new calculated sum to `pos`.

#### Edge Cases
- The program handles edge cases like when `k` or `x` is equal to `n` (all elements can be removed or negated).
- The program correctly handles scenarios where fewer than `x` elements need to be negated.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sorting and Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - Sorting the array helps in easily considering the smallest and largest elements.
   - The initial sum calculation is correct.

2. **Handling Removals and Negations:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum after removing elements and negating elements is sound.
   - The nested loop correctly considers all combinations of removals and negations within the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k` or `x` is equal to `n`, the program correctly handles the scenario where all elements can be removed or negated.
   - When fewer than `x` elements need to be negated, the program correctly handles this by considering the remaining elements.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The function returns the maximum value from `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after the game.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to handle the constraints and compute the optimal sum. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
