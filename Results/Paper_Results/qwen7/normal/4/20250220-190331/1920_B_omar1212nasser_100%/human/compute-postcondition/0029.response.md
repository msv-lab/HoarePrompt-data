Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array elements). It returns the maximum value among `removals` elements in the list `pos`, where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + removals` elements of the `elements` list.**
