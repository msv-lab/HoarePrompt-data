Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Sorting:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
   - In `func_2`, the program aims to find the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1.

3. **Calculation Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The function initializes a list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - It appends the sum after removing the last `x` elements (since Bob will negate these).
   - It iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive) to consider different removal scenarios.
     - For each iteration, it updates the sum `s` by removing the largest remaining element.
     - It updates `s2` (sum of the last `x` elements) by removing the largest remaining element.
     - If there are enough remaining elements to negate, it adds back the negated value.
     - It appends the new calculated sum to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Sorting and Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - Sorting the array helps in easily considering the smallest and largest elements.
   - The initial sum calculation is correct.

2. **Handling Removals and Negations:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum after removing elements and negating elements is sound.
   - The nested loop correctly considers all combinations of removals and negations within the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when `k` or `x` is equal to `n` (all elements can be removed or negated).
   - The program correctly handles scenarios where fewer than `x` elements need to be negated.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly computes the optimal sum for the given constraints. The main function `func_1` correctly processes each test case and calls `func_2` appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
