Output State: **`i` is 1; `removals` must be a positive integer; `s2` is `s2` minus the last element of `elements`[-1].**

Explanation: The code `s2 -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` (which is accessed using `elements[-i]` where `i` is 1) from `s2`. Since `i` is 1, it accesses the last element of `elements`. The value of `removals` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
