Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `b[i]` or `a[i]`, `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`, and if `i` was `len(a) - 1`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is true, `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`; otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. In the else case, `ans` is increased by `b[len(a)]`, and `i` is set to `len(a) + 1`.
