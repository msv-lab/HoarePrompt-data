Output State: **`counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `True` and `b[0]` followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `False`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise when `work` is `True`, `i` must be 2 if `work` is `False` and `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `a` to `ans`.
- The value of `i` is determined based on whether `work` is `True` or `False`. If `work` is `False`, `i` is 2; if `work` is `True`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to include the character at index `i` of `a`, depending on the value of `work`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
