Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` contains the concatenation of characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided, `j` is 0, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, and `len(a)` must be at least 1.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true or false, the variables `counter`, `ans`, `j`, `i`, `work`, and the length constraint of `a` remain unchanged as specified in the initial precondition.
