Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(len(a) - 1)`. The variable `j` is the only variable directly controlled by this loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `j`**: Since the loop runs for each value of `j` starting from 0 up to `len(a) - 2`, after the first iteration (where `j` is 0), the next value of `j` should be 1.

5. **Check other variables**: Other variables like `counter`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, and `j` are not directly controlled by the loop itself but might be affected by the loop body. However, since no specific changes to these variables are mentioned in the problem statement, we assume they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

6. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` should be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is set to `False`, `j` is 1**
