Output State: **`ans` is increased by `b[len(a)]`, `i` is `len(a) + 1`**.

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is increased by `b[i]`, where `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`. After that, `i` is incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes `len(a) + 1`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is increased by `b[len(a)]`.
