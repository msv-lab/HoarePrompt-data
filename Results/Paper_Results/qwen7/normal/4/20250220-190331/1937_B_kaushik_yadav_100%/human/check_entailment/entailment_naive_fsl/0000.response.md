Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the optimal path involves taking the minimum value between the current cell and the cell directly above it at each step. 

Consider the following test case:
```
3
2
10
01
```

The expected output should be:
```
00
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
10
1
```

This is because the program always prefers the value from the first row `a` over the second row `b`, which is not always the optimal choice. For instance, in the given test case, the lexicographically smallest string is `00` because we can take the value `0` from the second row at the second position, which is smaller than `1`. The program should compare the values from both rows and choose the minimum at each step to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is generated.
