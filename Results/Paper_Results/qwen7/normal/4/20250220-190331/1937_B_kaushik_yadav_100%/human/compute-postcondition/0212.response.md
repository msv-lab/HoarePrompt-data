Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b` followed by `a[i]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
