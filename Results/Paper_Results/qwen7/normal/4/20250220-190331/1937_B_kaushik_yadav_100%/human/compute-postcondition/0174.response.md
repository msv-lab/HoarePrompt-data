Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` contains the concatenation of characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions provided, `j` is 0, `i` equals `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, and `len(a)` must be at least 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the specified conditions for the variables remain consistent.
