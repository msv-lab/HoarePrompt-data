Output State: **`counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `i` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is set to `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

The code `i = 0` sets the variable `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
