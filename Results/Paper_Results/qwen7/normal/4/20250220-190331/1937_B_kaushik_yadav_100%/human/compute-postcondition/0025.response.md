Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string with the first character of `b` appended to it, `work` is set to False.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is initially 0, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
