Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for r in range(m, n)`. The variables involved here are `r`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `m` and `n` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is the variable that will iterate through the range defined by `m` and `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `r` is in the range `[m, n)`. This means `r` should start from `m` and go up to but not including `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Initially, `r` is not defined within the given state. We need to set `r` to `m` to start the loop.
   - The loop will continue as long as `r < n`. Therefore, `r` should be less than `n`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` starting from `m` and ensuring `r` is less than `n`.

**State:**
- `r` is `m`
- `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0
- `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0**
