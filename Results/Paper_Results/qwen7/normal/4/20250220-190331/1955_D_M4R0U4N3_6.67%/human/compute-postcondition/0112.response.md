Postcondition: `todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` contains the element `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `done` is updated by adding `a[j]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains the element `a[j]`.
