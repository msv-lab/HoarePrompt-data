Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is added to the `todo` set, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k**.

This means that the variable `old` has been added to the `todo` set, while all other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
