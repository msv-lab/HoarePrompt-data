Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `ans`, `done`, `k`, `r`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
