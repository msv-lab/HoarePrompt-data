Output State: **`extra` contains `a[r]`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, if `old` is found in `extra`, it remains in `extra`. If `old` is found in `done`, it remains unchanged and is not added to `todo`. Otherwise, `old` remains unchanged and is not in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This operation does not affect the values of `old`, `done`, or `todo`. Therefore, the condition regarding `old` remains the same: if `old` is found in `extra`, it stays there; if it is found in `done`, it remains unchanged and is not added to `todo`; otherwise, it remains unchanged and is not in `extra`.
