Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is an empty set, `done` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were not in `todo`, `m` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `j` is the last index of the list `a` (i.e., `m-1`), `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `old` remains unchanged and is not in `extra`. If `a[r]` is in `done`, `old` is added to `todo`. If `a[r]` is in `extra`, `old` remains in `extra`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo` or `done` and not in `extra`, `old` remains unchanged and is not in `extra`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is equal to `ans` + 1, and `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is incremented by 1, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `done` either does not contain the value of `old` or contains it, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `extra` may have a new element `a[r]`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain the value of `old`; otherwise, `todo` contains the value of `old` if `old` is in `extra`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, and depending on the value of `old`: If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` may have lost an element `a[m + 2]`, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` is removed from the `done` set. If `old` is not in `extra`, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` is removed from the `done` set if `old` was in the `done` set; otherwise, `todo` now includes `old`. If `old` is in the `done` set, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` remains in the `done` set. `extra` includes `a[m + 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
