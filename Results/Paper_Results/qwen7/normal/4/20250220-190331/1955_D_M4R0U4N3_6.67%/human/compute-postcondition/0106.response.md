Postcondition: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input, `m` is greater than 0.**
