Postcondition: `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `done` either does not contain the value of `old` or contains it, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `extra` may have a new element `a[r]`, and `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain the value of `old`; otherwise, `todo` contains the value of `old` if `old` is in `extra`.
