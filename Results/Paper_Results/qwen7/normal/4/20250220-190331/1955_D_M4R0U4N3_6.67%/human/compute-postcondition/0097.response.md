Output State: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input.**

Explanation: The line `extra = set()` creates an empty set named `extra`. This does not affect the values of `todo`, `done`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the creation of the `extra` set.
