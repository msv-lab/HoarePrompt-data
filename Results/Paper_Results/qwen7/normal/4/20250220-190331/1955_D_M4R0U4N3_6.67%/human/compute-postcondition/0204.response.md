Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is 1
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - The postcondition states that if `a[j]` is in the list `todo`, then `a[j]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `a[j]` is added to `extra`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

4. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration). Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `j < m`. Since `j` is now 2 and `m` is greater than 0, the condition `j < m` will still hold true if `m` is greater than or equal to 2.

6. **Postcondition for Next Iteration**: The postcondition for the next iteration will depend on the value of `a[2]`:
   - If `a[2]` is in `todo`, it will be removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - Otherwise, `a[2]` will be added to `extra`.

However, the specific values of `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are not given, so we cannot specify their exact states. We only need to adjust the states of `j` and `m` based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0**
