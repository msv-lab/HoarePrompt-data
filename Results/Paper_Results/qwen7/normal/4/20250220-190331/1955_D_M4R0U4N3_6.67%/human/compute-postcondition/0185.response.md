Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise, `r` is `n - 1`, and the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `ans` and `r` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are set to the integers provided by the input. The condition for `ans` (whether the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`) is still the same as before, and `r` is updated to `n - 1`.
