Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 0 otherwise.
- `r` is equal to `n - 1`.

The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.

To determine the value of `ans`, we need to consider the condition under which `ans` is set to 1 or 0. Since the exact values of `done` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will be either 1 or 0 based on the length of `done` relative to `k`.

Therefore, the output will be either 1 or 0 depending on the condition described.

Output: **ans (where ans is 1 if the length of done is greater than or equal to k, and 0 otherwise)**
