Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Since `a[j]` is not already in `todo`, the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain unchanged except for the addition of `a[j]` to `extra`. The values of `t`, `a`, `m`, and `j` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
