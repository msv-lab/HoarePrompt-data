Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `a[r]` is added to `extra`; `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is not added to `todo`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Given the initial conditions, `r` is equal to `m`, and `m` is less than or equal to `n`, while `n` is greater than `m`. The condition about `old` (whether it is in `extra` or not) does not change because the code only modifies `extra` and does not affect `old`.
