Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either a set containing `a[1]` or an empty set, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `a[j]`, `done` contains `a[0]` and `a[2]`, and `extra` is either an empty set or contains `a[0]`. Otherwise, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing `a[1]`.
