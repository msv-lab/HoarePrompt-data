Output State: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input, `done` is unchanged, `extra` is unchanged, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a set from these integers, assigning it to `todo`. The original values of `done`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The variable `todo` now holds the new set of integers from the user input.
