Output State: **`todo` is a set of integers from user input with `a[j]` removed, `done` contains the element `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is in `todo`, otherwise it is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j_prev + 1]` if `a[j_prev + 1]` is not in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `m` is greater than 0; `j` is `j_prev + 1`.**

This means that the set `todo` has had the element `a[j]` removed. The values of `done`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
