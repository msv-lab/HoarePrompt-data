Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` list has the value of `old` removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`, after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` will no longer be present in the list `extra`. All other variables (`r`, `m`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
