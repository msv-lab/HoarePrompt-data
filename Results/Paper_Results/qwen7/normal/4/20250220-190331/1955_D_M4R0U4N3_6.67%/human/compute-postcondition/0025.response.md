Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were not in `todo`, `m` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `j` is the last index of the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each `j` in the range `m`), every element in the list `a` will have been processed exactly once. If an element was in `todo`, it would have been moved to `done`. If it was not in `todo`, it would have been added to `extra`. Therefore, `todo` will be an empty set because all elements have been processed, `done` will contain all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, and `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`. The variable `m` will be the length of the list `a`, and `j` will be the last index of the list `a` since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = m-1`.
