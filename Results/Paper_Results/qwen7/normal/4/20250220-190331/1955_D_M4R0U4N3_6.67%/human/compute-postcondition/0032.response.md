Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, and `old` is no longer in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was previously in `extra`, after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` will no longer be in `extra`. The value of `old` remains unchanged, and it is still equal to `a[r - m]`.
