Output State: **`todo` is a set with one less element than before, specifically the element `a[j]` is removed; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split; `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[j]`; `extra` is either a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]`; `m` is a positive integer; `j` is 2 or 3 depending on the condition.**

The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given the initial state, `done` was either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set. After adding `a[j]`, `done` now contains both `a[0]` and `a[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
