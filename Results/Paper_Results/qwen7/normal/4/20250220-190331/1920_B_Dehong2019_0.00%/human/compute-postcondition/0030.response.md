Postcondition: `ans1` is `ans1` plus `a[i]`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is updated to `ans1` minus `a[i + x]` times 2, and `ans` remains the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x >= n`, then `ans` and `ans1` remain unchanged, and `i` is still `i + 1`.
