Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from it. The values of `x`, `i`, `ans`, and `ans2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
