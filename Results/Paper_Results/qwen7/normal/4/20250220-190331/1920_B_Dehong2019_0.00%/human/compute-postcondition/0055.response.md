Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, provided that the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`. If the sum of `i` and `x` is not less than `n`, the value of `ans1` remains as it was after the initial increase by `a[i]`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

This means that the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum between `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of `x`, `i`, and `ans1` have been modified according to the given conditions, while `ans2` remains unchanged from its previous state.
