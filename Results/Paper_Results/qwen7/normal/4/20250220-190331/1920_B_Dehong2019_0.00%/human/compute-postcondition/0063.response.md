Output State: **`x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increases `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The values of `x`, `i`, `ans`, and `ans2` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `ans1` being increased by `a[i]`, while the other variables retain their original values.
