Output State: `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x + 3`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (up to `k` times), the variable `i` will be set to `x + 3`. The variable `ans1` will be updated based on the condition `i + x < n`, where it will be increased by `a[i]` if the condition is met, otherwise, it will retain its previous value. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
