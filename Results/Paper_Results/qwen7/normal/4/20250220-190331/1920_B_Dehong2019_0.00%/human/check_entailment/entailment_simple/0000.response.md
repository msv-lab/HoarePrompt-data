### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and then the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This step is crucial because Alice will want to remove the largest elements first to minimize the impact on the sum, and Bob will want to flip the smallest negative elements to maximize the sum.

3. **Calculating `ans1`**:
   - `ans1` is initialized as the sum of the sorted array.
   - The program then iterates over the first `x` elements of the sorted array, subtracting twice their values from `ans1`. This simulates Bob's optimal strategy of flipping the `x` smallest (in absolute value) negative elements.
   
4. **Calculating `ans2`**:
   - `ans2` is initialized as `ans1`.
   - The program then iterates over the first `k` elements of the sorted array, adding their values to `ans1` and then subtracting twice the values of the corresponding elements from the end of the array (if within bounds). This simulates Alice's removal of `k` elements and Bob's subsequent flips.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` and prints it. This ensures that the result is the best possible outcome considering both players' optimal strategies.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the described game rules and calculates the optimal sum of the array after both players have made their moves.
