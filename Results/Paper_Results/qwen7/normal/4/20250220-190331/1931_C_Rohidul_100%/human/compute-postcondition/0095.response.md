Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is now the original value of `n - 4`, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the total number of iterations executed plus 1, `end` is 4, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` must equal `a[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was initially 3, after executing this line, `end` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
