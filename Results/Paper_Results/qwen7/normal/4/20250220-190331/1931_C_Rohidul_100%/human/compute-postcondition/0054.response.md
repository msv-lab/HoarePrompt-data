Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 4`, `r` is `n - 3 - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `le - (n - 2)`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was set to 1. After executing this line, `end` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
