Postcondition: `total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is -1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is n - 3, `ans` is 0, `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `total` remains 0, `l` is 1, `r` is -1, `a` maintains the property that consecutive elements are equal from index 1 to n-3, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is n - 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` equals `a[-1]`.
