Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was 0, so after executing this line, `l` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
