Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is `n - 3`, `r` is `n - 3 - 1`**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 2`. After executing `r -= 1`, the new value of `r` becomes `n - 3 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 4`. The values of `total` and `l` remain unchanged.
