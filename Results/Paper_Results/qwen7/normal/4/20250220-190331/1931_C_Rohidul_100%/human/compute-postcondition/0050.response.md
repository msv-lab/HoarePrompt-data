Output State: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 3`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-4] == a[n-3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `le - (n - 1)`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the adjacent elements in the list `a` are equal. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` is incremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute until `l` is no longer less than `r`. If the list `a` has consecutive duplicates, `l` will eventually reach `n - 3` when `r` remains at `n - 2`. At this point, `st` will be `le - (n - 1)`, reflecting the number of consecutive duplicates found.
