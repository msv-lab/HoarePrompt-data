Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `l` is `n - 5`
   - `r` is `n - 6`
   - `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`
   - `le` is the length of list `a`
   - `st` is -2
   - `end` is 3
   - `ans` is -1

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition requires two conditions to be met: `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `n - 5` and `r` is `n - 6`. Since `r` is already `n - 6`, for the loop to continue, `l` must decrease to allow `r > l`.
   - Additionally, the loop will continue if `a[r] == a[r - 1]`. Given that `a` is such that `a[1] == a[2]` and so on, this condition will likely be met unless `a[r]` changes.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l` to ensure `r > l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `l` must be decreased to allow `r > l`, `r` is `n - 6`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is 3, `ans` is -1**
