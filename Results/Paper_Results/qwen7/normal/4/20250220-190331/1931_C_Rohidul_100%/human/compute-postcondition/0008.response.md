Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1.**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Initially, `st` is 1, so after executing this line, `st` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
