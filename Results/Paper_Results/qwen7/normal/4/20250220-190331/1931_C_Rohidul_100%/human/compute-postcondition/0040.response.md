Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `st, end = 1, 1` updates the values of `st` and `end` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
