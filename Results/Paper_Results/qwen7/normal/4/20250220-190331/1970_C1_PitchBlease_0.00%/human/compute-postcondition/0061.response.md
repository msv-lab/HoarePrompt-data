Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`.
   - `current` is set to one such neighbor.
   - If the `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `queue` now contains a tuple of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), and `visited` now includes the neighbor of `current`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `tree[current]`.

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop will iterate over each neighbor in `tree[current]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`.
   - `current` will be updated to one such neighbor during the loop execution.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to ensure that `tree[current]` still contains at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`.
   - `current` will be updated to one such neighbor during the loop execution.

5. **Final State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - After the loop starts, `current` will be set to a new neighbor that is not in `visited`.
   - Therefore, `tree[current]` will still contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `tree[current]` and `current`.

**State:**
**`tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, and `current` is set to one such neighbor.**

This ensures that the loop can continue executing as long as there are unvisited neighbors in the current node's adjacency list.
