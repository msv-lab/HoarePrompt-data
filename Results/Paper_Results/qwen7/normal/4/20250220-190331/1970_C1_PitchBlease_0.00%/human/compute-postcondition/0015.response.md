Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple (neighbor_last, dist + 1), `current` is neighbor_last, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `neighbor_last`, and `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The line `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the variable `neighbor` to the set `visited`. Since `neighbor` was already part of the `visited` set (as per the initial state, which includes `start` and `neighbor_last`), adding `neighbor` again does not change the set. Therefore, the set `visited` remains the same as before, including `start` and `neighbor_last`, plus the new element `neighbor`. All other variables remain unchanged.
