Output State: **`current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is now in the `visited` set, and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to the `queue`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that the `queue` now contains an additional element. The `neighbor` is already in the `visited` set, and the `current` node and its properties remain unchanged.
