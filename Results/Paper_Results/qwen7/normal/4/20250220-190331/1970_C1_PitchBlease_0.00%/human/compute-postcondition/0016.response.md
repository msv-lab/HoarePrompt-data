Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple (neighbor_last, dist + 1) and an additional tuple (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`), `current` is `neighbor_last`, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `neighbor_last`, `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`) to the `queue`. All other variables remain unchanged. The `queue` now contains at least one tuple `(neighbor_last, dist + 1)` and the newly added tuple (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`).
