Output State: All neighbors of the starting node have been visited, and the `queue` contains tuples of each unvisited neighbor and their respective distances from the starting node. The `visited` set includes all nodes that have been processed, and `current` is set to the last unvisited neighbor that was processed.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- Every node that is reachable from the starting node via the tree structure has been visited.
- The `queue` contains tuples where each tuple consists of a node that was visited and its distance from the starting node.
- The `visited` set includes all these nodes.
- `current` is set to the last node that was processed before the loop terminated, which would be the farthest node from the starting node that can be reached, or it could be any node if the tree is fully explored and there are no unvisited neighbors left.
