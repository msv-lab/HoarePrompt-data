Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, indicating that all nodes have been processed. The `current` variable holds the last node that was processed, which is likely the target node if the algorithm found it. The `visited` set contains all nodes that are reachable from the `start` node, ensuring no node is visited more than once. The `dist` value represents the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `current` node, which is the final distance to the target node if found, or the distance to the furthest reachable node otherwise.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `queue` is empty, meaning no nodes are left to process. The `visited` set includes all reachable nodes, and `current` holds the last node processed, which could be the target node or the furthest node reachable from the start. The `dist` value gives the shortest distance to the `current` node, which is the final distance to the target if found.
