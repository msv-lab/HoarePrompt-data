Output State: **The program returns 0**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `queue` is empty because `popleft()` was called, which means all elements in the queue have been processed. Since `popleft()` removes elements from the queue, and `current` was the first element that was in the queue before processing began, it implies that `current` has already been processed and removed. The variable `dist` is initialized to 0, and since no other paths or distances have been calculated within the given context, `dist` remains 0. Therefore, the function returns 0.
