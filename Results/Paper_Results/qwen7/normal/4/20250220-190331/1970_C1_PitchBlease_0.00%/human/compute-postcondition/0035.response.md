Output State: **`current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called; `tree[current]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor; `neighbor` is added to the `visited` set.**

In this output state, the `current` variable remains unchanged as it was the first element in the queue before `popleft()` was called. The `tree[current]` condition about having at least one unvisited neighbor also remains valid. Additionally, the `neighbor` variable, which was a part of the unvisited neighbors of `current`, has now been added to the `visited` set.
