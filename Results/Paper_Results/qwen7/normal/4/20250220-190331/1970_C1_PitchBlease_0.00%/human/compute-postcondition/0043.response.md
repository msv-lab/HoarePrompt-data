Postcondition: `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `neighbor` is the next element in the adjacency list of `current`, `queue` now contains tuples of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`) and `neighbor`, `visited` now contains `neighbor`. This is true if and only if `neighbor` was not already in `visited`.
