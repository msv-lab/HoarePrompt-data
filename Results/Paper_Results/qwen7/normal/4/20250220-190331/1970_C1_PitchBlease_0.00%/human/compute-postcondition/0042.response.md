Postcondition: `current` is the first element that was in the queue before `popleft()` was called, `neighbor` is the next element in the adjacency list of `current`. After executing the if-else block, if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `queue` now contains tuples of (`neighbor`, `dist + 1`) and `neighbor` is added to `visited`. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, no changes are made to `queue` and `visited`.
