Output State: The queue is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their distances from the start node, where each tuple has the form (node, distance). The current node is the last node added to the queue whose distance was just calculated. The distance (dist) is 0, indicating we are still at the start of the traversal. The start is an integer representing the starting node, and the target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The visited set contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, including the start node and all nodes that have been added to the queue.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the queue will contain tuples of all nodes that can be reached from the start node, along with their respective distances. The current node will be the last node that was processed, and the distance will remain 0 as it is reset at the beginning of each iteration. The visited set will include all nodes that have been explored during the traversal.
