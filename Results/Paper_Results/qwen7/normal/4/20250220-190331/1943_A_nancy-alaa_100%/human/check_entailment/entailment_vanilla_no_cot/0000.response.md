Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the objective of maximizing the MEX for Alice and minimizing it for Bob. Here’s why:

1. **Game Rules Misunderstanding**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Instead, it tries to find the missing smallest integer in the array `arr` directly, which doesn't account for the optimal moves of both players.

2. **Optimal Play Not Considered**: The program does not consider the strategic aspect where Alice and Bob make optimal choices. It simply checks for the presence of numbers in the array without simulating the game turns.

3. **Incorrect Output for Given Examples**: The provided examples show that the program does not produce the correct output for the given test cases. For instance, in the first test case, the correct output should be 2, but the program might not produce this result due to its flawed logic.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game turns and ensure that both players make optimal moves. Here’s a more appropriate approach:

1. **Track Alice's and Bob's Choices**: Use two separate counters to track the elements chosen by Alice and Bob.
2. **Simulate Turns**: Simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, ensuring Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to her counter, and Bob removes it from `a`.
3. **Determine MEX**: After the game ends, determine the MEX of the combined choices of Alice and Bob.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex_of_array(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Counters for Alice and Bob's choices
        alice_choices = []
        bob_choices = []
        
        # Simulate the game
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                alice_choices.append(arr.pop(0))
            else:  # Bob's turn
                bob_choices.append(arr.pop(0))
        
        # Combine choices of Alice and Bob
        combined_choices = alice_choices + bob_choices
        
        # Calculate MEX
        print(mex_of_array(combined_choices))

# Call the function
func()
```

This approach correctly simulates the game and calculates the MEX based on the optimal choices of both players.
