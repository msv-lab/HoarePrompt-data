Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `first` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. The values of `i`, `n`, and `first` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions.
