Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `first` is `False`
   - `i` is `0`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification to `n` is mentioned, it stays the same.

5. **Postconditions and Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
   - The postcondition ensures that if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or `mpp[i] != 1`, the loop will break. However, this does not affect the initial state of `i` and `n` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be `1`.
- `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to `0`).

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`first` is False, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**.
