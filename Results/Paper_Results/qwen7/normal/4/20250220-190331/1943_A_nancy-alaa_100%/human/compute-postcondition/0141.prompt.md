You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be set to `n + 1`, `first` will retain its final value from the last iteration (which could be either `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition `mpp[i] == 1` was met for any `i` in the range), and `n` will retain its original value. The dictionary `mpp` will also remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n + 1`, `first` will be either `True` or `False` based on the conditions checked during the loop, and `n` and `mpp` will stay as they were initially.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer t, followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It returns information based on the input test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
