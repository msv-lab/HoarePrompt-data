Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), so the loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same.

5. **Postcondition**: The postcondition does not change the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` directly within the loop. It only specifies conditions under which the loop might break based on the values of `i` and `first`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains the same.**
