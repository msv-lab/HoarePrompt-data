Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `first` remains False, `i` is n, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `mpp` is unchanged.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `first` will still be False, `i` will be equal to the value of `n`, and the dictionary `mpp` will remain unchanged. The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`, and based on the conditions provided, it either prints `i` and breaks the loop or simply increments `i` without printing anything. Since the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will finally be equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be set to `n + 1`, `first` will retain its final value from the last iteration (which could be either True or False depending on the conditions met during the loop), and `n` will retain its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will continue to iterate until either `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, at which point `first` will remain `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
