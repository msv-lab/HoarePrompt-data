Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python when the value is not needed. It is typically used for iterating over a range or other iterable without using the actual values.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are more test cases to process. The number of test cases is determined by the input, which is read using `int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will continue to execute as long as there is input available, we need to ensure that the input mechanism (`int(input())`) is set up correctly. The initial state of `t` (the number of test cases) should be such that it allows the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is at least one test case to process.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, and there is at least one test case to process**.

This means that `t` must be at least 1, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.
