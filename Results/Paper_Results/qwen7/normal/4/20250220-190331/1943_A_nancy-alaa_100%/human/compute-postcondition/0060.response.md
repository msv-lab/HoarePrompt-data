Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and if the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.
