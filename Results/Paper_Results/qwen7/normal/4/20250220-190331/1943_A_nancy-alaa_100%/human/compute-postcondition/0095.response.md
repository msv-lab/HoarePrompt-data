Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. The initial state of `n` and `arr` remains unchanged.
