Output State: **`first` is `True`, `i` is an integer, `mpp` is a dictionary.**

Explanation: The variable `first` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i` and `mpp` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still an integer, and `mpp` is still a dictionary. The condition specified in the postcondition about `i` being a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` equaling 1 does not affect the value of `first`.
