Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the first input integer minus 2, `k` is the first input integer minus 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is the value of `a[f]`, `a[k]` remains unchanged, and `n` is updated to the second input integer which is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. Since `f` and `k` are defined as `first input integer - 2`, they remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the second input integer, which is `n - 1`. The value of `x` is still the value of `a[f]`, and `a[k]` remains unchanged. The initial value of `t` is not affected by this code.
