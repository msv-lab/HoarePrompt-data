Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the first input integer minus 1, `f` is the first input integer minus 3, `k` is the first input integer minus 3, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is the value of `a[f]`, `a[k]` remains unchanged, `a` is updated with new values from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the existing list `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `x`, and `a[k]`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
