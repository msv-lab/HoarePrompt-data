Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the first input integer minus 1, `k` is the first input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is sorted in descending order, and `a[k]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The list `a` is sorted in descending order, and the value of `a[k]` remains unchanged as per the precondition.
