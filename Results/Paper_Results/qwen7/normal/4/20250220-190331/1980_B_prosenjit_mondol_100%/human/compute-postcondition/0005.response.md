Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `f` in the list `a` to the variable `x`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as the initial state.
