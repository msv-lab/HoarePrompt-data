Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the first input integer minus 2, `k` is the first input integer minus 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `x` is the value of `a[f]`, and `a[k]` remains unchanged.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x` beyond what is already stated in the precondition. Therefore, the overall postcondition is simply a restatement of the precondition, as no new information is introduced by the if-else block.
