Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `f` is the second input integer minus 1, so \(f = n - 1\).
- `k` is the third input integer minus 1, so \(k = m - 1\), where \(m\) is the third input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and it is sorted in descending order.
- The current value of `a[k]` is less than `x`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without any variables or expressions being evaluated. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
