Postcondition: `b` must be at least 1. After executing the if-else block, if `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in list `e` plus one. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` remains equal to `j`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or condition.
