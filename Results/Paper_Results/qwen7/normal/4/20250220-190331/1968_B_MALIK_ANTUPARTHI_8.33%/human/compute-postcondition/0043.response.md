Output State: **`b` is `b + 1`, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `b`, `d` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `d = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `d`. The values of `b`, `c`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
