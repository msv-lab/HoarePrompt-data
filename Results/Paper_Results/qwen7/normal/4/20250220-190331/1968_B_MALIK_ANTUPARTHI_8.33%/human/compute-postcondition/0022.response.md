Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `j` is the next integer in the range [0, `b-1`], `k` is `j + 1', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `b`, `j`, and `k`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `b`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or conditional statement.
