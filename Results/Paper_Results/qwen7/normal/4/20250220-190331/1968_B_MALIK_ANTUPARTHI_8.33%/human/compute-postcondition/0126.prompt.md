Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `b` remains unchanged, `i` has been incremented by the number of times the loop was executed (which is `b`), and `k` is set to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `b` is less than or equal to 0, `c` is an integer from the input, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is either `2` or `1` depending on whether `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and `j` is `2`.

Explanation: Since the loop runs for a maximum of 3 iterations as per the given information, and considering the conditions inside the loop, `j` will eventually reach 2. The variable `k` will be set to either 2 or 1 based on the conditions within the loop. The value of `b` will be less than or equal to 0 because the loop stops after 3 iterations, meaning `b` was initially 3 but gets decremented each time through the loop until it reaches 0. All other variables (`c`, `i`, `d`, `e`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All variables `b`, `c`, `i`, `k`, `d`, `e`, and `j` retain their final values after the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
