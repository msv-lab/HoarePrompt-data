Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `b` used in the `range(b)` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 within the loop, so its initial value does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `b` is given as an integer input from the user.

3. **Conditions for loop execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < b`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0 and does not affect the loop's execution, we don't need to adjust its state.
   - We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is an integer input from the user
- `i` is 0
- `b` is an integer input from the user
- `c` is an integer input from the user
- `d` is the string input from the user
- `e` is a string input from the user
- `k` is 0

We need to adjust the state of `b` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` must be at least 1**
