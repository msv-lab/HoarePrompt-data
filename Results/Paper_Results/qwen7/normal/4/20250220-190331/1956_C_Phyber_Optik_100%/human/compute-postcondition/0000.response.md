Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer, and the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 remains valid. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵, which is still true since no other test cases have been processed yet.
