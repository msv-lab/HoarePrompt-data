Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the elements in a row or a column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which is the size of the matrix.
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1, and then it attempts to calculate a sum using a loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect for the problem's requirements.
   - The loop calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the matrix sum through permutations.
   - After calculating the sum and printing it along with `2n`, it prints `n + n` operations, each of which is incorrectly set up to change the entire row and column to the same permutation.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each setting the row or column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The sum of the matrix after filling it with the permutation will be \( n \times n \times n \).
   - We need to perform \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, making a total of \( 2n \) operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because:
- The sum calculation is wrong.
- The operations performed do not maximize the matrix sum.

Correctness: **False**
