Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is an input integer, `j` is 6, `sum` is 156, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `j`, `sum`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input for `n` is expected to be an integer, and the other variables retain their original values and conditions.
