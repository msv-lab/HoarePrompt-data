Based on the initial state provided:

- `sum` is 156 (though this is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `t` is greater than 0 (though this is also not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `2`: This is a constant value.
2. `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 2, this becomes `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive into separate arguments for the print function.

Since `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to get the minimum output, i.e., `n = 6`.

So, the expression `n - 1` would be `6 - 1 = 5`.

And `range(1, n + 1)` would generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
```
2 5 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

Output: **2 5 1 2 3 4 5 6**
