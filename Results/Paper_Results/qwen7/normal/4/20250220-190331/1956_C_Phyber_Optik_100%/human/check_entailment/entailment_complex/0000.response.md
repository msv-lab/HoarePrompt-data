Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute rows or columns.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, it uses a formula to calculate a sum based on squares of integers, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
3. The program incorrectly calculates the sum as \( 1 \) for the first test case and a large value for the second test case, which does not reflect the actual maximum possible sum.
4. The program also prints \( n + n \) operations, which is not necessarily the optimal number of operations required to achieve the maximum sum.
5. The operations printed do not follow the rules of the problem statement, as they do not involve permuting rows or columns to maximize the sum.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
