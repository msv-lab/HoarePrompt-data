Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be at least 6.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `sum` is 140.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument to `print` is `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given `n` is at least 6 and `j` is 2, the smallest possible value for `n` is 6. Therefore, `n - j + 1` would be `6 - 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which expands to all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is at least 6, the range will include numbers from 1 to 6.

4. **Combining the Results:**
   - The `print` statement will output `2`, followed by `5`, and then the sequence of numbers from 1 to 6.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 5 1 2 3 4 5 6**
