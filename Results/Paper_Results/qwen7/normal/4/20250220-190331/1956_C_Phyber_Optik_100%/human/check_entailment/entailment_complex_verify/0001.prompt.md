You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)

            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `n` is at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0. The loop has completed its execution, and the values of `sum`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `t` reflect the state after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \), where \( 1 \leq t \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving squares of integers and prints the sum along with another value derived from \( n \). It then prints multiple lines of output, each containing specific sequences of numbers based on \( n \). After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the elements in a row or a column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which is the size of the matrix.
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1, and then it attempts to calculate a sum using a loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect for the problem's requirements.
   - The loop calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the matrix sum through permutations.
   - After calculating the sum and printing it along with `2n`, it prints `n + n` operations, each of which is incorrectly set up to change the entire row and column to the same permutation.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each setting the row or column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The sum of the matrix after filling it with the permutation will be \( n \times n \times n \).
   - We need to perform \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, making a total of \( 2n \) operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because:
- The sum calculation is wrong.
- The operations performed do not maximize the matrix sum.

Correctness: **False**
