Based on the initial state provided:

- `sum` is 156 (though this is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 6.
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `1`: This is a constant value.
2. `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 1, this becomes `n - 1 + 1 = n`.
3. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

Since `n` must be at least 6, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 6, to determine the output. If `n` were any larger, the output would include more numbers, but the smallest valid case will suffice to illustrate the pattern.

So, if `n` is 6:
- `n - j + 1` is `6 - 1 + 1 = 6`.
- `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 7)`, which expands to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```
1 6 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

Output: **1 6 1 2 3 4 5 6**
