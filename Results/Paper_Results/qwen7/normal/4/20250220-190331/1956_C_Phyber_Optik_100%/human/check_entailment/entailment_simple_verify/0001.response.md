### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the elements in a row or a column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1, and then it attempts to calculate a sum using a loop that iterates from 2 to `n`. However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect for the problem's requirements.
   - The loop calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the matrix sum through permutations.
   - After calculating the sum and printing it along with `2n`, it prints `n + n` operations, each of which is incorrectly set up to change the entire row and column to the same permutation.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is the maximum possible value, which is \( n \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each setting the row or column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The sum of the matrix after filling it with the permutation will be \( n \times n \times n \).
   - We need to perform \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, making a total of \( 2n \) operations.

5. **Evaluation of the Given Code**:
   - The sum calculation is indeed incorrect and unrelated to the problem.
   - The operations performed do not maximize the matrix sum as intended.
   - The code incorrectly sets the entire row and column to the same permutation, which does not achieve the desired result.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the loop calculates a sum using a formula that is not relevant to the problem.
   - The operations printed are incorrect and do not reflect the correct approach to maximize the matrix sum.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because:
- The sum calculation is wrong.
- The operations performed do not maximize the matrix sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix and the operations it performs are not aligned with the problem's requirements.
