Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be at least 4
   - `sum` is 20 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be at least 5, `sum` is 20**
