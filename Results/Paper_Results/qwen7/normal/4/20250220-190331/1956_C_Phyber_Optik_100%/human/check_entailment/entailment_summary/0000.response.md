Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \).
   - It calculates a sum using a specific formula and prints this sum along with \( 2n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) lines for each test case, each line containing two operations: one for permuting the rows and one for permuting the columns.
3. **Formula and Operations**:
   - The formula used to calculate `sum` is incorrect. The formula should be related to the operations needed to fill the matrix optimally, but the current implementation does not reflect this.
   - The operations printed do not seem to align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the operations should set the diagonal elements to their respective positions to maximize the sum, but the current operations do not achieve this.
4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to its optimal value, which is \( i + j - 1 \). This can be achieved by performing \( n \) row permutations and \( n \) column permutations.
   - The correct approach would involve setting the first row to \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), then the second row to \( [2, 3, \ldots, n+1] \), and so on. Similarly, for columns.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements.

Correctness: **False**
