Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged; `coef0[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `coef0[i] = 0` sets the value of `coef0[i]` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
