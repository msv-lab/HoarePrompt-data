Output State: **`visited[i]' is True, n' is an integer representing the number of disks, x' is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, y' is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, r' is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, and visited' is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each disk has been visited or not with `visited[i]' now set to True and nodes contains i**.

Explanation: The code appends the index `i` to the `nodes` list. Since `visited[i]` was already `True`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
