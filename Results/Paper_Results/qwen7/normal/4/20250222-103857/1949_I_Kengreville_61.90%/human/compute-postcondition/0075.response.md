Output State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least one element; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the first element in the updated `nodes` list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c1` by adding `coef1[j]` where `j` is the first element in the `nodes` list. Since `nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `j` is set to the first element of `nodes`. The value of `c0` is not affected by this code, and neither is the content of the `nodes` list (other than `j` being assigned its first element). Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `c1` and the unchanged nature of the `nodes` list.
