Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function reads the input and initializes necessary variables.
   - It iterates over each disk to perform a DFS if the disk has not been visited.
   - During the DFS, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values for disks that are tangent to the current disk.
   - It checks if there is any disk with a non-zero `coef1` value, which indicates that the sum of radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

2. **Function `dfs(i)`**:
   - This function performs a DFS starting from disk `i`.
   - It marks the disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - For each unvisited disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i`, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values.
   - It recursively calls itself for disk `j`.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.
   - The solution uses a graph-based approach where each disk is a node and edges represent tangency between disks.
   - The `coef0` and `coef1` values are used to represent the linear system of equations derived from the tangency conditions.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
   - The DFS ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are explored.
   - The `coef1` values being non-zero indicate that the sum of radii can be decreased without violating the tangency and non-overlap conditions.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
