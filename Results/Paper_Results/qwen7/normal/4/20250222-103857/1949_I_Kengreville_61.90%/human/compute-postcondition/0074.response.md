Output State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` where `j` is the first element in the updated `nodes` list**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c0` by adding `coef0[j]` where `j` is the first element in the `nodes` list. The `nodes` list remains unchanged, and `c1` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is to `c0`.
