Postcondition: `j` is an index; `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`; if `visited[j]` is False and the distance between `(x[i], y[i])` and `(x[j], y[j])` equals the sum of their respective radii squared, then `visited[j]` is set to True and `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`. If the condition is not met, the values of `visited[j]`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged.
