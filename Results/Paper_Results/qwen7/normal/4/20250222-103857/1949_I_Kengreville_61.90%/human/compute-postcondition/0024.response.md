Output State: **`j` is 2, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `visited[j]` is True, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`**

Explanation: The code `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` updates the value of `coef1[j]` to be the negation of `coef1[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, while the other variables retain their initial states.
