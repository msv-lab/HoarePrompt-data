Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be equal to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `nodes` will be an empty list because no nodes are visited during the DFS calls.
- `c0` will be the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, which is 0 since `nodes` is empty.
- `c1` will be the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, which is also 0 since `nodes` is empty.
- `ok` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is `False`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Output: **NO**
