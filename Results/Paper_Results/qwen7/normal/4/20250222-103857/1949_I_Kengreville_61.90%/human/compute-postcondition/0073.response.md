Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in nodes:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `nodes`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nodes` is a list containing at least one element.
   - `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `nodes` list.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is iterating over the `nodes` list, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have taken the value of the last element in the `nodes` list.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes` must still contain at least one element (i.e., it should not be empty).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `nodes` must still contain at least one element.
   - `c1` will be increased by `coef1[j]` again, where `j` is now the new value of the first element in the updated `nodes` list.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`nodes` is a list containing at least one element, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the first element in the updated `nodes` list**.
