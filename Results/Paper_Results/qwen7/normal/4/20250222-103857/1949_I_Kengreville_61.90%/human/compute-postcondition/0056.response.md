Output State: `nodes` is a list containing at least three elements; `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `nodes` will have at least three elements (since it needs to go through at least three iterations), and both `c0` and `c1` will have been incremented according to the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`.
