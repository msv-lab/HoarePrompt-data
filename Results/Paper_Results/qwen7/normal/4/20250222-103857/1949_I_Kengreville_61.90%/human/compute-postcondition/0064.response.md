Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` remains unchanged, `coef0[i]` is 0, `coef1[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(i)` is called with `i` as an argument. However, without knowing the exact implementation of the `dfs` function, we can only infer that `i` is passed to the function. Since no changes are made to `i` within the provided context, `i` remains 2. The variables `c0` and `c1` are updated based on the empty list `nodes`. Since `nodes` is empty, `c0` and `c1` remain unchanged at their current values of 0. The variable `ok` remains unchanged because `c1` is 0 and does not change. The values of `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` also remain unchanged as they are not modified by the call to `dfs(i)`. All other conditions and values from the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
