Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Determine the State After Each Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
     - `j` is 0
     - `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`
     - `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`
     - `visited[j]` is False (since `j` is 0)
     - The distance condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is checked, but it is not specified whether this condition was satisfied or not.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will increment `j` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 1.
   - The values of `dx` and `dy` do not change within the loop and remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `dx` and `dy` remain the same.
   - `visited[j]` (which is `visited[1]`) is initially False.
   - The distance condition is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` without further information.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`, `visited[j]` is False**
