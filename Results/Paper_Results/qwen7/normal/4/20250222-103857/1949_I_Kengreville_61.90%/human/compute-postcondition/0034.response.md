Output State: The variable `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `c0` will hold the total sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each `j` present in the `nodes` list, and `c1` will hold the total sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each `j` present in the `nodes` list. The `nodes` list remains unchanged from its last updated state during the loop's execution, and all other variables (`i`, `n`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`) retain their initial or previously calculated values.
