Output State: The variable `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `nodes` will still be a non-empty list (since it was non-empty at the start and no operation inside the loop modifies or empties it). The variable `c0` will hold the total sum of all values in the `coef0` array corresponding to elements in `nodes`. Similarly, `c1` will hold the total sum of all values in the `coef1` array corresponding to elements in `nodes`.
