Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ok` is False, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` `False` values, and `coef1` is a list of `n` `None` values.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged. If `visited[i]` is False, then the `nodes` list remains non-empty, `c0` remains unchanged, and `c1` remains 0. If `visited[i]` is True, the conditions remain as initially described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
