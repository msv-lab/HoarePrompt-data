Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in the original `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in the original `nodes` plus 1, and `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged; `coef0[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `nodes = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `nodes`. This changes the value of `nodes` from its original non-empty list to an empty list. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `c0`, `c1`, `ok`, and `coef0[i]`) remain unchanged with their respective conditions and values.
