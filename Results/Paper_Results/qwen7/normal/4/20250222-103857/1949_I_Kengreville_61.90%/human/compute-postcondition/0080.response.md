Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `nodes` is a non-empty list, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` for each element `j` in `nodes`; `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged. If `visited[i]` is False, then the `nodes` list remains non-empty, `c0` remains unchanged, and `c1` remains 0. If `visited[i]` is True, the conditions remain as initially described.**
