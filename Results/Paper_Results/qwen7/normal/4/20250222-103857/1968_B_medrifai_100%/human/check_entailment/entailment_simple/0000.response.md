Reasoning:

1. The program iterates through both strings `a` and `b` using two pointers `i` and `j`.
2. For each character in `a`, it tries to find the corresponding character in `b` starting from the current position `j` in `b`.
3. If the character is found, it increments both pointers `i` and `j` and increases the count `c`.
4. If the character is not found, it breaks out of the loop.
5. The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the next character in `a` within the remaining part of `b` starting from `j`.

Given this logic, let's verify the correctness:

- The function `func_1` correctly identifies the position of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`.
- The main loop correctly updates the indices and counts the number of matching characters in order.
- The termination condition ensures that the loop stops when either `a` or `b` is fully traversed.

Based on the provided code and the logic explained above, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
