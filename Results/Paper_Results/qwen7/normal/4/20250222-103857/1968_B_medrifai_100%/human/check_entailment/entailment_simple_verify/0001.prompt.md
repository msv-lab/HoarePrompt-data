You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Output

    2

    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, representing the current indices in strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - Variable `c` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs until either `j` reaches the end of `b` or `i` reaches the end of `a`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the next character match in `b` for the current character in `a`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index, it updates `j` and `i` to move to the next character in both strings and increments `c`.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, the loop breaks, indicating no further matching characters can be found.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds the index of the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If found, it returns the index relative to `j`.
   - If not found, it returns `-1`.

### Verification:

- The logic in the main loop and the function `func_1` correctly implement the requirement to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The program handles all edge cases where the prefix of `a` might not be a subsequence of `b` (e.g., when `func_1` returns `-1`).

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1:**
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - `func_1("10011", "1110", 0, 0)` returns `0` (index of '1' in "1110").
  - `func_1("10011", "1110", 1, 1)` returns `1` (index of '0' in "1110").
  - `func_1("10011", "1110", 2, 2)` returns `-1` (no '1' left).
  - Result: `k = 2`.

- **Example 2:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
  - `func_1("100", "110", 0, 0)` returns `0` (index of '1' in "110").
  - `func_1("100", "110", 1, 1)` returns `1` (index of '0' in "110").
  - `func_1("100", "110", 2, 2)` returns `-1` (no '0' left).
  - Result: `k = 2`.

- **Example 3:**
  - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
  - `func_1("1", "111", 0, 0)` returns `0` (index of '1' in "111").
  - Result: `k = 1`.

- **Example 4:**
  - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
  - `func_1("1011", "1111", 0, 0)` returns `0` (index of '1' in "1111").
  - `func_1("1011", "1111", 1, 1)` returns `1` (index of '0' in "1111").
  - `func_1("1011", "1111", 2, 2)` returns `2` (index of '1' in "1111").
  - `func_1("1011", "1111", 3, 3)` returns `3` (index of '1' in "1111").
  - Result: `k = 4`.

- **Example 5:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
  - `func_1("100", "11010", 0, 0)` returns `0` (index of '1' in "11010").
  - `func_1("100", "11010", 1, 1)` returns `1` (index of '0' in "11010").
  - `func_1("100", "11010", 2, 2)` returns `4` (index of '0' in "11010").
  - Result: `k = 3`.

- **Example 6:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
  - `func_1("100", "0", 0, 0)` returns `-1` (no '1' in "0").
  - Result: `k = 0`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. Therefore, the program is correct.
