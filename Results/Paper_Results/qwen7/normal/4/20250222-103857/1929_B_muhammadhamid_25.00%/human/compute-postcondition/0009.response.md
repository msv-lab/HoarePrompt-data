Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
   - `k` is an integer equal to 1.
   - The current value of `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(k / 2))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `k` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - We need to compute `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
   - Substituting the value of `k`, we get `math.ceil(1 / 2)`.
   - `1 / 2` equals `0.5`.
   - `math.ceil(0.5)` rounds `0.5` up to the nearest integer, which is `1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print` statement will output `1`.

Output: **1**
