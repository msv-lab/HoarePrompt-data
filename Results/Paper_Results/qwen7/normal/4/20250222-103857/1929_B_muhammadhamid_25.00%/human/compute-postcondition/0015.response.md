Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
   - `k` is an integer equal to 1.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs `int(input())` times.
   - Inside the loop, the postcondition is that if `k` is less than or equal to 2 times the value of `n`, the current value of `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the program continues the loop with `k` greater than 2 times `n`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments:**
   - The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the state.
   - The key variables in the loop head are `k` and the input for the number of iterations.

4. **Analyze the loop execution:**
   - Since the loop runs `int(input())` times, the state needs to be adjusted for each iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `k` remains 1 because it is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.
   - For subsequent iterations, `k` will be greater than 2 times `n` if the condition is not met.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - The number of iterations left is reduced by 1.
   - `k` remains 1 for the first iteration but will change to a value greater than 2 times `n` for subsequent iterations.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.
- `k` remains 1 for the first iteration, but for subsequent iterations, `k` will be greater than 2 times `n`.

Since we are only adjusting the states at the start of the next iteration, and the loop runs based on the input, the state for the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to 1, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`**.
