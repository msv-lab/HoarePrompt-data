Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 5`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `n`, `k`, or the number of iterations left within the loop, these variables retain their initial values. The only change is that the number of iterations left decreases by one.
