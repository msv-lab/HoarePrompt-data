You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, and the final values of `n` and `k` will be those provided by the last input pair. The number of iterations left would be 0, as the loop has completed all its executions.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `n` and `k` will be the same as the last input pair provided by the user. The loop counter will have reached zero, indicating that no more iterations are left to execute.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. It returns different values based on the conditions involving n and k.

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
