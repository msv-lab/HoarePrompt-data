Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
   - The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(k // 2 + 1)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The code prints the result of `k // 2 + 1`, where `//` is the floor division operator in Python, which returns the largest possible integer less than or equal to the division result.
   - Since the exact values of `k` are not provided, we need to consider the condition given: if `k` equals 1, the number of iterations left remains unchanged.

4. **Possible Values of `k`**:
   - If `k` is 1, then `k // 2 + 1` would be `1 // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For any other value of `k`, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will be evaluated accordingly.

Given the condition that if `k` equals 1, the number of iterations left remains unchanged, and without further specific values for `k`, we can only determine the output based on the given condition.

Output: **1**
