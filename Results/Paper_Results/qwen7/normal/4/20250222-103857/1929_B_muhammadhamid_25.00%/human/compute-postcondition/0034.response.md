Output State: The loop will have executed all its iterations, meaning the variable `input_count` (which is `int(input())`) will be exhausted. After all iterations, there will be no more inputs to process. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` will be set according to the input provided for that iteration. The final output of the loop will consist of either `1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or `k // 2 + 1` based on the conditions specified in the loop body, for each respective input pair `(n, k)`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: All input pairs `(n, k)` have been processed through the loop, and the corresponding outputs have been printed based on the given conditions. The loop has completed its execution, and no further inputs are available.
