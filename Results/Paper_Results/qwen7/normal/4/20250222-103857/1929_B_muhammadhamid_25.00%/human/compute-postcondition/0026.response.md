Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 4`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by space, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial number of iterations left was `int(input()) - 3`, and after executing the code, it decreases by 1, making it `int(input()) - 4`. The values of `n` and `k` are updated, but the initial state of the number of iterations left is adjusted by subtracting 1.
