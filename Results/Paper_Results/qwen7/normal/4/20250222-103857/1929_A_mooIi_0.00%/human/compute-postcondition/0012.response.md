Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, we will have processed `t` different sets of inputs. Each set consists of an integer `n` (number of elements) followed by `n` integers to be sorted. The variable `ar` will contain the sorted strings for each of these sets, and this process will repeat `t` times as specified by the value of `t`.
