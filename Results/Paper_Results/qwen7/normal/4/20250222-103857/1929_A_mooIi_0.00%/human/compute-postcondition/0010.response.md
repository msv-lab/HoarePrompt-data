Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input**.

Explanation: The code `ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` performs the following operations:
1. `input().split()` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits them into a list of strings.
2. `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer.
3. `sorted(...)` sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. `map(str, ...)` converts each integer in the sorted list back to a string.
5. The result is stored in `ar`.

Since the initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, and `ar` is updated to a list of sorted strings of the input integers, the output state reflects these changes.
