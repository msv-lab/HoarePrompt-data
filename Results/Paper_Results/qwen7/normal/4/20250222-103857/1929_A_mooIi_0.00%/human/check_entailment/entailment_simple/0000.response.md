Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the current implementation simply sorts the array and prints it as a string of space-separated values. This does not maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in such a way that the largest possible difference is achieved between consecutive elements. The optimal strategy is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The current implementation does not follow this strategy. Therefore, the given function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
