You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of test cases processed, with each test case having its own `n` (number of integers) and `ar` (sorted list of those integers).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Sorting and Rearranging**:
   - The program sorts the array elements but converts them to strings before joining them back into a single string.
   - It then prints the sorted array elements joined with spaces.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
- To maximize this sum, we should place the smallest element at `a_1` and the largest element at `a_n`, and so on, ensuring the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

### Issues in the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Rearrangement**:
   - The program sorts the array but does not rearrange the elements to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply prints the sorted array as a string.
   - Sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty because the relative positions of elements matter.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the sorted array as a string, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the maximum beauty value, not the sorted array.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: Input `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Correct rearrangement would be `[1, 3, 2]` to maximize beauty.
  - Beauty = `(3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - The program outputs the sorted array as a string: `"1 2 3"`.

- **Test Case 2**: Input `[69, 69, 69]`
  - The array is already sorted, and rearranging doesn't change the beauty.
  - Beauty = `0`.
  - The program outputs the sorted array as a string: `"69 69 69"`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not rearrange the array to maximize the beauty and instead outputs the sorted array as a string, which is not the required format.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
