Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the integer input by the user, `ar` is a list of strings representing the sorted integers from the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value entered by the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Additionally, it is mentioned that `n` must be greater than 0, which is now reflected in the updated state.
