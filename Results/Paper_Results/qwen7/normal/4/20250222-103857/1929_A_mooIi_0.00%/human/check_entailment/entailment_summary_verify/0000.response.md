Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as intended. The program sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string, which does not maximize the beauty of the array. 

To maximize the beauty, we need to strategically arrange the elements such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. The provided program fails to achieve this because sorting and printing as strings does not reorder the elements to maximize the differences.

Let's analyze the provided examples with the correct approach:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3
     2 1 3
     ```
   - Correct Output: 
     ```
     2
     ```
   - Explanation: The optimal arrangement is `[1, 3]`, giving a beauty of `(3 - 1) = 2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     3
     69 69 69
     ```
   - Correct Output: 
     ```
     0
     ```
   - Explanation: All elements are the same, so the beauty is `0`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     5
     100 54 80 43 90
     ```
   - Correct Output: 
     ```
     57
     ```
   - Explanation: The optimal arrangement is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, giving a beauty of `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     4
     3 4 3 3
     ```
   - Correct Output: 
     ```
     1
     ```
   - Explanation: The optimal arrangement is `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, giving a beauty of `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: 
     ```
     2
     2 1
     ```
   - Correct Output: 
     ```
     1
     ```
   - Explanation: The optimal arrangement is `[1, 2]`, giving a beauty of `(2 - 1) = 1`.

The provided program does not perform the necessary rearrangement to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as strings, which is incorrect.

Final: **False**
