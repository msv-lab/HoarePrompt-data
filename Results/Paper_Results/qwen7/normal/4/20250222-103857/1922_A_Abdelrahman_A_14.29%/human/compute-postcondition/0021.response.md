Output State: **`c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, `no` is False**

Explanation: The line `no = False` does not change the values of `c` or `x`. It only updates the value of `no` to `False`, which was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
