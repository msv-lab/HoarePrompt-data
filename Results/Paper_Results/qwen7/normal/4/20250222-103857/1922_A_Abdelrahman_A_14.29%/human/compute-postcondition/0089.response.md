The only objects in the loop head are variables `x`, `c`, and the loop itself. Since `x` is the next element from `c` and the loop is defined by `x in c`, the state of `x` and `c` needs to be adjusted for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an integer (the next element from `c`), `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, and `no` is True.

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must still contain elements, and `x` will be the next element from `c`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is an integer (next element from `c`), `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `no` is True, and `c` must still contain elements**
