You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of equal length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)). It checks if \(c\) contains any character not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if \(c\) contains only characters present in \(a\) and \(b\), it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, it prints 'NO' for each remaining test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length Handling**: It correctly reads the length of the strings (`slength`).
3. **Initial Checks**: The initial checks to determine if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b` are correct. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, it prints "NO" immediately, which is correct because `c` cannot match the same template that `a` and `b` do.
4. **Character Check Loop**: The loop that checks each character in `c` to see if it appears in both `a` and `b` is almost correct but has a flaw. The current implementation will print "YES" as soon as it finds a character in `c` that is not in both `a` and `b`. However, this logic is flawed because it should check if every character in `c` either matches the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (if the template allows it) or does not match (if the template disallows it). The current logic only checks if the character is present in both `a` and `b`, which is not sufficient.
5. **Final Check**: The final check ensures that if no valid template is found, it prints "NO", which is correct.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is not entirely correct because it does not properly handle the template matching logic. Specifically, the loop that checks each character in `c` should ensure that the character either matches the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (if the template allows it) or does not match (if the template disallows it).

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
