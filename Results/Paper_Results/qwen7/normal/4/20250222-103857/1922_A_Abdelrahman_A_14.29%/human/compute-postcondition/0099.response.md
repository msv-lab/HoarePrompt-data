Based on the initial state provided:

- `no` is `True`
- `c` is an input string
- `i` is `tests`
- `b` is an input string
- `x` is the last character from the string `c` that was not found in either list `a` or `b`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` directly without any modification or reference to other variables.

Output: **NO**
