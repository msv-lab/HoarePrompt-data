Output State: **`i` is an integer, `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0), and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and if `i` is less than `n - 1`, the conditions remain unchanged; `prog_cities[i]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `prog_cities[i]` to be the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. The values of `i`, `back`, `forward`, and the condition regarding `n - 1` remain unchanged. The new value of `prog_cities[i]` is calculated based on the current values of `forward` and `cities[i]`.
