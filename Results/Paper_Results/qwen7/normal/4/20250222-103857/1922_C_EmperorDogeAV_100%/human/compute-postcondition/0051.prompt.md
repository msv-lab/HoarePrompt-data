You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `back` will be `cities[n - 2]`, and `forward` will be `cities[n - 1]` if `n > 1`. For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to `1` if the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`). Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it will remain `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is determined based on the conditions described. Specifically, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`:
    #
    #- If the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.
    #- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it remains `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `cities` of n integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is set based on specific conditions: if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, the element is set to `1`; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the distances if the index is not the last one, or `0` if it is the last index.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is determined based on the conditions described. Specifically, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`:

- If the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.
- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it remains `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
