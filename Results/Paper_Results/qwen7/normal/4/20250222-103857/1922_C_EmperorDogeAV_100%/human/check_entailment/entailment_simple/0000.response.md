Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the closest city for each city in the `func_1` function.
2. The logic in `func_1` checks the distances to the previous and next city and sets the value in `prog_cities` accordingly.
3. The main program calculates the prefix sums for the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists.
4. For each query, the program uses these prefix sums to compute the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
5. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
   - The `func_1` function should be applied to both the original list and its reversed version to get `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.
   - The prefix sums are calculated but not used correctly. The program should use the prefix sums to find the minimum cost path considering the unique closest city property.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost in the main part of the program is flawed. It directly subtracts prefix sums without accounting for the unique closest city property.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
