Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is updated to `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is now `cities[i + 1]`, and `prog_cities[k + 1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to `cities[i + 1]`. Given that `i` was initially `k + 1`, after the increment, `i` becomes `k + 2`. The other variables (`n`, `back`, and `prog_cities[k + 1]`) remain unchanged.
