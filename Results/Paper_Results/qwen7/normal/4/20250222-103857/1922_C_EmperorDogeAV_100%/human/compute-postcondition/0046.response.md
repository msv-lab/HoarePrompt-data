Postcondition: `i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. After the execution of the if-else block:
- If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.
- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])` if `i < n - 1`, or remains unchanged if `i` is not less than `n - 1`.
