Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not correctly identifying the closest city for each city in the list. The logic inside `func_1` does not properly determine the closest city based on the given problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will not produce these results because it incorrectly calculates the closest city distances. For instance, in the first query (from city 1 to city 4), the program should calculate the minimum cost to travel from city 1 to city 4 using the closest city rule, but it does not correctly implement this logic.
