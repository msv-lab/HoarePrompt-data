### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost can either be the direct distance between the cities or the cost to travel to the closest city plus the distance from the closest city to the destination.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to compute an array where each element represents the index of the closest city.
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are used to quickly compute the cumulative costs for forward and backward travel.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - The logic for setting `prog_cities[i]` is correct. It should set `prog_cities[i]` to the index of the closest city, not the absolute distance.

4. **Issues with the Provided Code**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly identifies the closest city for each city and sets `prog_cities[i]` to the index of the closest city.
   - The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` calculations are based on these correct values, leading to correct results for the queries.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the closest city for each city using the correct logic.
   - Use the indices of these closest cities to compute the prefix sums.
   - Use the prefix sums to answer the queries efficiently.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly identifies the closest city for each city and uses the correct values for the prefix sums. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
