Output State: **`i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `-99999999999999999999`, `forward` is either `cities[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`) or remains `999999999999999999` (if `i == n - 1`), and `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.**

Explanation: The code sets `back` to `-99999999999999999999`, which updates the value of the `back` variable. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `forward`, and `prog_cities[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
