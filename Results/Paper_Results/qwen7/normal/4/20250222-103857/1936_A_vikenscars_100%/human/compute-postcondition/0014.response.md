Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` because `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_item_idx` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain within its current bounds (greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

6. **Final state**:
   - `max_item_idx` remains 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `ans` remains the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`max_item_idx` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 3, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**.
