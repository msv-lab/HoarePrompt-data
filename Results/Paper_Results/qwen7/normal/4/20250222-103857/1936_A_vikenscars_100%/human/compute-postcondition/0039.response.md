Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values and conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `max_item_idx` is 3.
   - `pair_idx` is 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 3, 0)`.
     - Based on the postcondition, if `ans1` is '<', it remains '<'.
     - If `ans1` is not '<', it can be either '>' or '='.
     - If `ans1` is '=', `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 0, 0)` and retains its previous value if it was '>' initially.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - `i` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such specification is given, `n` stays the same.

4. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` remains the same (though its exact value is not specified, it doesn't change based on the loop head).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 3, 0)`**.
