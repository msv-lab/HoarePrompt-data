Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)` and is less than.**

Explanation: The line `max_item_idx = i` updates the value of `max_item_idx` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
