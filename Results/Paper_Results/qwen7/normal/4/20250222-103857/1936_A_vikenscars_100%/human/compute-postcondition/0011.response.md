Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(1, 1, 2, 2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `max_item_idx` to be equal to `i`. Given that `i` was initially 2, `max_item_idx` is now 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
