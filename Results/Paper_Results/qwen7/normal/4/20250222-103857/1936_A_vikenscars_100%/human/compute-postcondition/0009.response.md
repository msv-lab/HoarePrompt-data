Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `max_item_idx` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`, which is less than.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must still satisfy `2 < n \leq 10^4`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

5. **Final State:**
   - `max_item_idx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max_item_idx` is 1, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the return value of `func_1(0, 0, 1, 1)`, which is less than**.
