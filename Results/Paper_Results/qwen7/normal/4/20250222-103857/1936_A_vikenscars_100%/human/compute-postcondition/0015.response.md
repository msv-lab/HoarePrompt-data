Output State: **`max_item_idx` is 2, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 3, `ans` is the return value of `func_1(2, 2, 3, 3)`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is reassigned to the return value of the function call `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. Given the initial state, `max_item_idx` is 2, `i` is 3, and the function `func_1` is called with arguments (2, 2, 3, 3). The values of `n` and `max_item_idx` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values for `ans` and the unchanged values for `n` and `max_item_idx`.
