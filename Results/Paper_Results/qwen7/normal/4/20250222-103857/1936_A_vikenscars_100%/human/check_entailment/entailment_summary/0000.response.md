### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. The allowed operations are comparing the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: This function is used to query the comparison result between \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\). It correctly formats and prints the query and reads the response.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Finding `max_item_idx`**:
     - The function starts by setting `max_item_idx` to 0.
     - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \((p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{max_item_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
     - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\). This step ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the index with the highest single element value under the OR operation.
   
   - **Finding `pair_idx`**:
     - The function then sets `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
     - It iterates through all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx})\) with \((p_{max_item_idx} \mid p_i)\).
     - If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If the response is `=`, it further checks \((p_{pair_idx} \mid p_{pair_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\). If the latter is `>`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\). This ensures that `pair_idx` is the index that maximizes the OR operation when paired with `max_item_idx`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` aims to find the indices that maximize the OR operation first and then the XOR operation.
   - The approach is sound and should work within the constraints.
   - The number of queries used is \(2n + 1\) (one initial query to find `max_item_idx` and \(n\) queries to find `pair_idx`), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

Given the above analysis, the function `func_2` appears to correctly implement the required logic and should meet the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
