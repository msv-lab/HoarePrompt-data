### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly prints a query in the required format and reads the response from the standard input.
   - It returns the response string, which is either `<`, `>`, or `=`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The goal of `func_2` is to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized.
   - The function starts by finding the index `max_item_idx` with the highest single bit set in its binary representation. This is done by comparing `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_i)` for all `i` from `1` to `n-1`.
   - After identifying `max_item_idx`, it then finds another index `pair_idx` such that `p_{max_item_idx} ⊕ p_{pair_idx}` is maximized. This is done by comparing `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_{pair_idx})` with `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_i)` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Query Analysis**:
   - The queries used in the function are valid and follow the rules specified in the problem statement.
   - The function ensures that the number of queries does not exceed `3n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the required format after determining them.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is small (as low as 2) and finds the correct indices.
   - The logic for finding the indices with the maximum XOR is sound and follows a valid approach.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized using at most `3n` queries. The function `func_2` correctly identifies the indices and prints them in the required format.

### Correctness:
**True**
