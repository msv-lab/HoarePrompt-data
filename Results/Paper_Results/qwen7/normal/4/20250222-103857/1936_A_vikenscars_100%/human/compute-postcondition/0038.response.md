Postcondition: `max_item_idx` is 3, `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 3, 0)`. If `ans1` is '<', then `ans1` remains '<'. If `ans1` is not '<', then `ans1` is either '>', or if `ans1` is '=', `ans2` is the return value of `func_1(3, 3, 0, 0)` and retains its previous value if it was '>' initially.
