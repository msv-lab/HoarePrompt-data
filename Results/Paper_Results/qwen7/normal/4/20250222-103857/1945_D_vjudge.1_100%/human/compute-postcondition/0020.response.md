The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `b` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on the input lists `a` and `b` and the integer `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns a value based on the lists `a` and `b` and the integer `k`.**
