Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
2. In `func_1`, the list `c` is created by taking the minimum of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. This step ensures that for each position `i`, the cost to move Kirill to that position is minimized.
3. A suffix sum array `suff` is computed, which stores the cumulative sum of elements in `c` from the end of the list towards the start. This allows efficient computation of the total cost of moving Kirill to any position `i` by summing the relevant prefix of `suff`.
4. The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity, ensuring that any valid cost will be smaller than the initial value.
5. The loop iterates through the first `k` positions, calculating the cost of moving Kirill to each position `i` using `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updating `ans` with the minimum cost found.
6. Finally, the minimum cost `ans` is printed.

Given the logic and steps described, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions by considering both the immediate cost `a[i]` and the accumulated cost `suff[i + 1]`.

Correctness: **True**
