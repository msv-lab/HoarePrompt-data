Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `suff[i]` to be the sum of `suff[i + 1]` and `c[i]`. Given that `i` was initially `n-1`, after the execution of the line `i` becomes `n-2`. The value of `suff[i]` is now calculated as `suff[n-1] + c[n-1]`. All other variables remain in their initial state, so `n` remains a non-negative integer.
