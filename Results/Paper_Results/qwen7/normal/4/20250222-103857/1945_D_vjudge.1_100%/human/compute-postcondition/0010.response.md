Output State: **`i` is -1, `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in the list `c`, `ans` is infinity.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initialized to `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `-1`. The variable `suff[i]` is updated in each iteration to be the sum of all elements in the list `c` starting from `c[i]` to the end of the list. By the end of the loop, `suff[-1]` will hold the sum of all elements in `c`. The variable `ans` is initialized to `float('inf')` and remains unchanged throughout the loop.
