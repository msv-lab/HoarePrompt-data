Output State: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the smallest value obtained from adding `a[i]` to `suff[i + 1]` for every `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.
