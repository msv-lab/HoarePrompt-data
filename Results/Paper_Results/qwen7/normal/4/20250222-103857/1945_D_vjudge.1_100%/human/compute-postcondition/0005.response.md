Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `suff[i]` is `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`**

The code updates the value of `suff[i]` to be equal to `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`. Since the initial state already had `suff[i]` defined as `suff[i + 1] + c[i]`, updating it to the same expression does not change its value. Therefore, the values of both `i` and `suff[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
