### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k`.
- It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

#### Processing Each Test Case:
- The function `func_1` is called with parameters `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
- Inside `func_1`:
  - A new array `c` is created where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements from `a` and `b`.
  - A suffix sum array `suff` is initialized.
  - The suffix sum array `suff` is populated by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning, accumulating the values from `c`.
  - The variable `ans` is set to infinity to keep track of the minimum cost.
  - The loop iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost of moving Kirill to each of these positions, updating `ans` with the minimum value found.

#### Cost Calculation:
- For each position `i` in the first `k` positions, the cost is calculated as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
  - `a[i]` represents the cost to move Kirill to position `i` directly.
  - `suff[i + 1]` represents the accumulated cost of moving through all positions from `i + 1` to the end of the line.

#### Output:
- The minimum cost `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Suffix Sum Array `suff`:**
   - The suffix sum array `suff` is correctly initialized and filled from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - This ensures that `suff[i]` contains the sum of all elements from `c[i]` to `c[n-1]`.
   - The initialization of `suff` as `[0] * (n + 1)` is correct because `suff[n]` will always be `0` and will not be used in the calculations.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` is correct.
   - `a[i]` is the direct cost to move Kirill to position `i`.
   - `suff[i + 1]` is the accumulated cost of moving through all positions from `i + 1` to the end, which is correctly computed using the suffix sum array.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - The loop iterates over the first `k` positions and updates `ans` with the minimum cost found.
   - This ensures that `ans` holds the minimum cost among all possible positions within the first `k` positions.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `k` positions in the queue. The use of suffix sums ensures efficient computation of the accumulated costs.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
