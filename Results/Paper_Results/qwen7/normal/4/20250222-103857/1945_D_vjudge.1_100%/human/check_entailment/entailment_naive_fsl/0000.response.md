Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the cost of bribing people between Kirill's current position and his target position within the first `m` people.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

According to the problem description, Kirill wants to be among the first 2 people in the queue. The costs are as follows:
- `a = [7, 3, 6, 9]`
- `b = [4, 3, 8, 5]`

The minimum cost for Kirill to move to the first position would be:
- Move from position 3 to position 1: Cost = `b[2] = 8`
- Move from position 2 to position 1: Cost = `a[1] = 3`

Total cost = `8 + 3 = 11`

However, the program calculates the cost as:
- For position 1: `a[0] + suffix_sum[1] = 7 + 11 = 18`
- For position 2: `a[1] + suffix_sum[2] = 3 + 8 = 11`

The program outputs the minimum of these values, which is `11`. This is incorrect because the actual minimum cost should be `11`, but the program incorrectly calculates it as `18`.

The issue lies in how the suffix sum is used and the way the minimum cost is calculated. The program should consider the cumulative cost of bribing all people between Kirill's current and target positions, but it does not do this correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
