Output State: `removals` must be equal to 3, `i` is 4, `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the differences between the last `negatives + removals` elements and the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `pos` is a list containing the values of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to 3.

In this final state, `removals` will have reached its maximum value of 3 as specified in the loop condition. The variable `i` will be 4 since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `removals + 1`. The variable `s` will be reduced by the sum of the last 3 elements in `elements` because `removals` is 3. The variable `n` will be the cumulative sum of the differences between the last `negatives + removals` elements and the last `removals` elements, considering potential `IndexError` cases. Finally, the list `pos` will contain the computed values of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration, resulting in three such values appended to `pos`.
