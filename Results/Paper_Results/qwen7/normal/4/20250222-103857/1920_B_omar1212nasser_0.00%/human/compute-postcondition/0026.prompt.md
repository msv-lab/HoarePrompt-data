Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `removals` is an integer with a value between 1 and 6, `negatives` is an integer with a value between 1 and 3, `elements` is a list of integers where either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    s -= elements[-i]
    try:
        n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
    except IndexError:
        n = 0
    pos.append(s - 2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-2]`, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2] + elements[-2] - elements[-3]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`, and `pos` has had the value `s - 2 * n` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `removals` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-4]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4] + elements[-4] - elements[-5] + elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or 0 if an `IndexError` occurs, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`, and `s - 2 * n` has been appended to `pos`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
