Output State: `removals` must be exactly 3, `i` is 4 (since the loop runs from 1 to `removals + 1` and `removals` is 3), `s` is `s` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements in `elements`, `n` is the adjusted sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` considering the `IndexError` handling, `pos` is a list containing the values of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to 3.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `removals` will be set to 3.
- `i` will be 4 (the last value it takes).
- `s` will be the original sum of `elements` minus the sum of the last 3 elements.
- `n` will be calculated based on the last 3 elements of `elements` while handling potential `IndexError` by setting `n` to 0 if an error occurs.
- `pos` will be a list containing the results of `s - 2 * n` for each iteration from 1 to 3.
