Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, removals + 1)`. This means `i` will take values from 1 to `removals`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the Range for `removals`**: The variable `removals` is an integer with a value between 1 and 6. For the loop to execute, `removals` must be at least 1.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`. Therefore, `removals` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, `n`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition and can remain as given.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `removals` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 1**
