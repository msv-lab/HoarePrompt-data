Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `removals`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `removals + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `removals` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`.
   - `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred.
   - `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `removals + 1`. This means `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `removals` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `removals` must still be at least 1.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `s` remains `s` minus `elements[-1]`.
   - `n` remains either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred.
   - `pos` remains a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`removals` must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `n` is either `elements[-(negatives + 1)] - elements[-1]` plus `elements[-1]` minus `elements[-2]` or 0 depending on whether an `IndexError` occurred, `pos` is a list containing the value of `s - 2 * n`**.
