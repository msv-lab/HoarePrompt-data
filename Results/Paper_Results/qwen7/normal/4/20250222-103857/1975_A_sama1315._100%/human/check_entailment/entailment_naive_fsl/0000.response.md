Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version of itself, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing through the described operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
5
7 9 2 2 3
3
1 2 3

Output:
No
Yes
Yes
```

For the first test case `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, the array cannot be made non-decreasing by any sequence of splits and swaps. However, `func_1` incorrectly returns 'Yes' because it checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version, which is not the same as checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by the described operations.

To correctly solve this problem, the function should check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part. This ensures that the array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing by swapping the parts.
