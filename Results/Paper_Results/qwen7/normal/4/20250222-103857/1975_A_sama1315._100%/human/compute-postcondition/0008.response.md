Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 2, so after executing the code, `idx` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `idx` being 3, while `t`, `data`, `results`, and `n` retain their initial conditions.
