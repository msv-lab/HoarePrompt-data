Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 2`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - 1` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(a)` to the variable `result`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. The value of `result` depends on the function `func_1` and the list `a`, but since the exact function and its implementation are not provided, we can only state that `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`.
