Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of integers. Each pair consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, the function performs operations on the list a and returns results for each pair.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any direct parameters but rather processes data through a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `t` indicating the number of sub-cases to process, followed by `t` pairs of integers. The first integer in each pair is `n`, which specifies the length of the list `a`, and the second element is the list `a` itself. The function then performs some unspecified operations on each list `a` and returns the results accordingly for each sub-case.
