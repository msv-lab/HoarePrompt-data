Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and performs the following steps:
1. Computes the length `n` of the array.
2. Sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
3. Concatenates the array with itself to get `concatenated_a`.
4. Iterates over possible splits of `concatenated_a` to see if any split matches `sorted_a`.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- It checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version of itself, which is not the same as checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by the described operations.
- The function does not consider the condition where the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.

### Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

#### Correct Logic
The correct logic involves:
1. Checking if the array can be split into two parts such that:
   - The first part is non-decreasing.
   - The second part is non-decreasing.
   - The last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.

This can be done using a single pass through the array to find the correct split point.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
