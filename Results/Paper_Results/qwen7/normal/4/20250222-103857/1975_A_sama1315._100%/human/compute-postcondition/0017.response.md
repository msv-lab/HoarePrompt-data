Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx - n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code increments `idx` by `n`. Since `n` is equal to `data[idx - n]`, `idx` is updated to `idx + n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the provided code snippet.
