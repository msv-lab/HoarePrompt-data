The function accepts a list of integers `a` and checks if there exists any starting index in the concatenated version of the list (where the list is appended to itself) such that the sub-list of length equal to the sorted version of `a` is equal to the sorted version of `a`. If such a sub-list is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
