Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + (total_iterations - 1)`, `results` is a list containing `total_iterations` elements which are the return values of `func_1(a)` for each iteration, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])` for the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - (total_iterations - 2)` and having length `n` for the last iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)` for the last iteration.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be equal to the number of iterations, `idx` will be adjusted to point just past the last processed element in `data`, `results` will contain the results of applying `func_1(a)` for each iteration, and `n` and `a` will reflect the final iteration's parameters.
