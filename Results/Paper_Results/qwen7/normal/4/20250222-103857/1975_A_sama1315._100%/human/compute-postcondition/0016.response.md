Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer equal to `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`, `a` is updated to be the list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `a` by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n` into a list of integers using `map(int, ...)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
