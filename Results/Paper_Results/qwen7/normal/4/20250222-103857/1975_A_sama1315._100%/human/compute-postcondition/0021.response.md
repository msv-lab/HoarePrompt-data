Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)` and the previous element, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**.

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the integer value of `data[idx]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
