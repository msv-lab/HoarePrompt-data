Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
   - `idx` is `idx + n`
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`
   - `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop just completed an iteration, `t` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. It must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Update the states**: The other states (`data`, `idx`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `result`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + n`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a)`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(a)`**
