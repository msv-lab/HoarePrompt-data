Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the return value of `func_1(a)`, the previous element, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[idx - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the slice of `data` starting from `idx - n - 1` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from the corresponding slice of `data`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` converts the slice of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` into a list of integers. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + 2` as per the initial state, and `n` remains as `int(data[idx - 1])`. The list `a` now contains integers derived from the specified slice of `data`.
