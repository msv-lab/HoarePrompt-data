You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if the given array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.

1. **Sorting the Array**: `sorted_a = sorted(a)` sorts the array `a`.
2. **Concatenating the Array with Itself**: `concatenated_a = a + a` creates a new array by concatenating `a` with itself.
3. **Checking Subarrays**: The loop iterates through all possible subarrays of `concatenated_a` of length equal to `sorted_a`. If any such subarray matches `sorted_a`, it returns `'Yes'`.

However, this approach is flawed because:
- It only checks if there exists a subarray in the concatenated array that matches the sorted array. This does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.
- For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. Concatenating it with itself gives `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`. The subarray `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]` exists in the concatenated array, but the original array cannot be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

1. **Reading Input**: It reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: It iterates over each test case, extracts the necessary information, and calls `func_1` to get the result.
3. **Outputting Results**: It prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, we need to ensure that `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.

Given the flaw in `func_1`, the program will not correctly identify arrays that can be made non-decreasing by the specified operation.

### Conclusion

Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
