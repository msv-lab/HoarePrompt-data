Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `pattern` contains 'AB'[3] which is 'B'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `n // 2` must be greater than 4. This means `n` must be greater than 8 (since `n // 2 > 4` implies `n > 8`).
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 5.
- `n` must be greater than 8.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 8**
