Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50) where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) (between 1 and 50). If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and generates a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length \( n/2 \), then prints this string. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
