Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer - 1, pattern is an empty list**.

The code initializes an empty list for `pattern`. Since `n` is an input integer - 1, its value does not change. The value of `t` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the only change is that `pattern` is now an empty list.
