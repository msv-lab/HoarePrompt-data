Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing one element (the input provided), `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input provided by the user to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending the input, `a` now contains one element, which is the input provided. All other variables remain unchanged.
