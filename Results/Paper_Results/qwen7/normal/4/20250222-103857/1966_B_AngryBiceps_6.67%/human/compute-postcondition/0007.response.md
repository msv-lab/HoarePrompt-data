Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing one element (the input provided), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. Since `a` contains only one element, which is the input provided, `first_row` now holds the first character of that input. All other variables remain unchanged.
