Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. However, the logic implemented in the function is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for "NO" Output**:
   - The code checks if the first row is different from the last row and if the first row is not uniform (i.e., contains more than one unique character). This is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - The correct approach would involve checking if there exists at least one row or column that has a mix of 'W' and 'B' colors, as this would prevent the entire grid from becoming a single color.

2. **Insufficient Handling of Grid Colors**:
   - The code does not properly handle the grid's internal structure. It only checks the first and last rows and does not consider the intermediate rows and columns.
   - A more comprehensive approach would be to check if there is any subrectangle within the grid that contains both 'W' and 'B' colors, as this would indicate that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
