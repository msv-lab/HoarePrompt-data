Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
