### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks whether it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the given operations. An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares within the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the same color.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and the grid itself.
   - It then creates two strings: `first_row` (the first row of the grid) and `last_row` (the last row of the grid).
   - The function checks two conditions:
     - If the first row is uniform (all elements are the same) but different from the last row.
     - If the first row and the last row are uniform but different from each other.
   
3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The condition `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]` checks if the first row is uniform but different from the last row. This would mean it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last rows are different.
   - The condition `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row` checks if both the first and last rows are uniform but different from each other. This also means it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the first and last rows are different.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the function prints "YES", indicating it's possible to make all squares the same color.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles cases where the grid is already uniform.
   - It correctly identifies cases where making the entire grid uniform is impossible due to differences in the first and last rows or columns.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given solution is sound and correctly identifies when it's possible to make all squares the same color.
   - However, the solution only checks the first and last rows and does not consider the possibility of making the entire grid uniform by considering columns as well.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Test Case Analysis**:
  - **Case 1**: `2 1
  W
  B`
  - The first and last rows are different, and the function correctly outputs "NO".
  
  - **Case 2**: `6 6
  WWWWBW
  WBWWWW
  BBBWWW
  BWWWBB
  WWBWBB
  BBBWBW`
  - The first and last rows are different, and the function correctly outputs "YES".

  - **Case 3**: `1 1
  W`
  - The grid is already uniform, and the function correctly outputs "YES".

  - **Case 4**: `2 2
  BB
  BB`
  - The grid is already uniform, and the function correctly outputs "YES".

  - **Case 5**: `3 4
  BWBW
  WBWB
  BWBW`
  - The grid is already uniform, and the function correctly outputs "YES".

  - **Case 6**: `4 2
  BB
  BB
  WW
  WW`
  - The grid is already uniform, and the function correctly outputs "YES".

  - **Case 7**: `4 4
  WWBW
  BBWB
  WWBB
  BBBB`
  - The first and last rows are different, and the function correctly outputs "NO".

  - **Case 8**: `1 5
  WBBWB`
  - The first and last rows are the same, and the function correctly outputs "YES".

- **Function Summary**:
  - The function summary states that the function checks specific conditions related to the first and last rows of the grid. However, it does not mention checking columns.

- **Logical Flaw**:
  - The function only checks the first and last rows, but it should also check the first and last columns to ensure that the entire grid can be made uniform. The current implementation might miss cases where the grid can be made uniform by considering columns instead of rows.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. While the solution correctly identifies some cases, it fails to consider the possibility of making the entire grid uniform by checking columns. Therefore, the given solution is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
