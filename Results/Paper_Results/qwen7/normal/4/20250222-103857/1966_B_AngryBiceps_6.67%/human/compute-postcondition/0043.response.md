Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the input string from the user and the second element is the new input string, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new input string to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contained one element (the first input string), after appending the new input string, `a` now contains two elements. The values of `t`, `m`, `i`, `n`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged except that `a` now includes the newly appended string.
