Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is the final value of `n`, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `a` is a list containing all the input strings provided during the loop's execution, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in the order they were provided, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in the order they were provided.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains as initially set, `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` will be equal to `n` (which is the total number of iterations), `n` is the count of how many times the loop ran, `a` contains all the input strings provided during the loop, `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a`.
