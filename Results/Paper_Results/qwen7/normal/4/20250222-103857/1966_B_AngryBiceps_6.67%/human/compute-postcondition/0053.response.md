Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `m` retains the value it had after the first input.
- `i` will be equal to `n`, where `n` is the total number of iterations, i.e., the number of times the loop ran.
- `a` contains all the input strings provided during the loop.
- `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a`.
- The first string in the list `a` consists of the same character repeated.
- The first string is different from the last string in the list `a`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
