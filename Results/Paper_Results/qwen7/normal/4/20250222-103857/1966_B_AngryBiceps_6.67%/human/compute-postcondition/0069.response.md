Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is equal to an empty string**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, after appending the input, `a` now contains one element, which is the input provided. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
