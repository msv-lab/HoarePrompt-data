Output State: **`j` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element at index `j` from the `todo` list. Given that `j` is 2, it attempts to remove `a[2]` from `todo`. However, since `a[0]` might or might not be present in `todo`, and `a[1]` might or might not be present in `extra`, the conditions for `done` and `extra` remain as described in the initial state. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2.
