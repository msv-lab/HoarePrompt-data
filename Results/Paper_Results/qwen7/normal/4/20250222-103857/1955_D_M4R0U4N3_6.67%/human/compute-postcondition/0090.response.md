Output State: **`n` is the input integer minus 1, `m` is the input integer `m`, `k` is the input integer `k`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is the last element processed in the loop, `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and hence added to `extra` during the loop, `done` contains all elements from `a` that were removed from `todo`, `todo` contains none of the elements from `a` that were initially in `todo` and not removed during the loop, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
