Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`; `extra` does not contain the value of `old`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `old` from the list `extra`. The other variables (`ans`, `r`, `m`, `old`, and `extra`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values as per the initial state. The only change is that `extra` no longer contains the value of `old`.
