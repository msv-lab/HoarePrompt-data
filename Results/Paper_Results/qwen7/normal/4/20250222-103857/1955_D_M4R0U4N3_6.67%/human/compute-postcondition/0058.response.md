Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` minus `old`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The line `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `done`. Since `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`, it means that the set `done` now no longer contains `a[r - m]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
