Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0.
- `r` is `m`.
- If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `done` now contains `a[r]` with one element removed from `todo`.
- If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `ans` remains unchanged, `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `extra` contains `a[r]`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for r in range(m, n):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Variable `r`:**
   - The loop starts with `r = m` and increments `r` by 1 in each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `r` was `m`.
   - In the next iteration, `r` will be `m + 1`.

2. **Variables `m` and `n`:**
   - These variables are constants for the loop and do not change within the loop.
   - Therefore, they remain the same: `m` and `n`.

3. **Variables `ans`, `done`, `todo`, `old`, and `extra`:**
   - The values of these variables depend on the condition inside the loop and the specific value of `a[r]`.
   - Since the exact values of these variables after the previous iteration are not specified, we need to consider the possible changes based on the loop condition.

### Possible Changes in the Next Iteration
- If `a[m + 1]` is in `todo`, then:
  - `todo` will not contain `old`.
  - `old` will no longer be in `extra`.
  - `done` will contain `a[m + 1]` with one element removed from `todo`.
- If `a[m + 1]` is not in `todo`, then:
  - `ans` remains unchanged.
  - `todo` will not contain `old`.
  - `old` will no longer be in `extra`.
  - `extra` will contain `a[m + 1]`.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration
Since the exact values of `ans`, `done`, `todo`, `old`, and `extra` are not specified, we can only adjust the variable `r` and keep the other variables as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `todo`, `old`, and `extra` may change based on the condition inside the loop; `done` may change based on the condition inside the loop.**

However, since we need to provide a specific state, we can assume the most general case where `r` is incremented:

State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `todo`, `old`, and `extra` may change based on the condition inside the loop; `done` may change based on the condition inside the loop.**

For simplicity, we can represent it as:

State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`.**
