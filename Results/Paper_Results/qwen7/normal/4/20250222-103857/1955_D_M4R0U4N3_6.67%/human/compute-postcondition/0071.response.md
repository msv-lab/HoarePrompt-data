Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` is in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `old = a[r - m]` assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to `old`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
