Postcondition: `r` is `m + 2`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `todo`, `done`, and `ans` are as follows:
- If `old` is in `extra`, then `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `old` is not in `done`, then `done` remains unchanged, and `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`.
