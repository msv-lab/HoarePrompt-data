Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` is greater than 3, `extra` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `todo` does not contain `a[j]`, and `done` now contains `a[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is 3, `done` now includes `a[3]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
