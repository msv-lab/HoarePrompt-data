Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `old` is added to `todo`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is no longer in `done`.**

The code `todo.add(old)` adds the variable `old` to the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
