Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input value, `k` is an integer equal to the third input value, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input, `done` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `done`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `m`, `k`, or `todo`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
