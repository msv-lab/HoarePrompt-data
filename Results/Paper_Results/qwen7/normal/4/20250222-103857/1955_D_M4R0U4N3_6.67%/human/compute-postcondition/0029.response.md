Output State: **`r` is `m`; `old` is `a[m - m]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Given that `r` is initially equal to `m`, the expression `r - m` evaluates to `0`. Therefore, `old` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. The values of `r` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
