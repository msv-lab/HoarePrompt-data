Postcondition: `j` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`. If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `extra` also includes `a[2]`. If `a[0]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` is updated to include `a[2]`.
