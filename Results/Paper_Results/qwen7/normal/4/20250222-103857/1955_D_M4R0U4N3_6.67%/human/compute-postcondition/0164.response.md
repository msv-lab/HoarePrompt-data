Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `done` has had the element `old` removed, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`**

Explanation: The line `done.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `done`. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, and `old` remain unchanged, but the list `done` now no longer contains the element `old`.
