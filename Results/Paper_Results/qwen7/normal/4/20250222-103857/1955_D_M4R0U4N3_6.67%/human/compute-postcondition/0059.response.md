Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is now `a[r - m]` and is added to `todo`, `extra` includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` minus `old`, and `todo` contains `a[r]` and `a[r - m]`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.add(old)` adds the value of `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) to the set `todo`. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, if `a[r - m]` was already in `todo`, it would remain unchanged. However, if it was not, it will be added. The other variables (`r`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `done`) remain unchanged.
