Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers with `a[j]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, and `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The code removes `a[j]` from the `todo` set. The value of `j` is 2, so `a[j]` refers to the third element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
