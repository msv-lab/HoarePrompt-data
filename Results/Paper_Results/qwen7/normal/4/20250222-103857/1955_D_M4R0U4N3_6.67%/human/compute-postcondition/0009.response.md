Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `todo` list has removed the element `a[0]`, `done` set has added the element `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is 0, it adds `a[0]` to the set `done`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
