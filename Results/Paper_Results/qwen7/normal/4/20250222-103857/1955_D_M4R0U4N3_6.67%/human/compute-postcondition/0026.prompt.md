Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split and converted to integers, `num_test_cases` is the number of test cases, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0. If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` list has removed the element `a[0]`, and `done` set has added the element `a[0]`. Otherwise, `a[0]` is added to `extra`, and `a[0]` is not in `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `extra` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `todo` does not contain `a[0]`, and `done` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]` depending on whether `a[j]` was in `todo` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 3, `extra` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]` and may now also contain `a[3]`, `todo` does not contain `a[0]`, and `done` contains `a[3]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise it contains `a[0]` or `a[1]` as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
