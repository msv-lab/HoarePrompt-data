Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is currently in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo`, `old` is in `extra` and not in `done`, `old` is added to `todo` and removed from `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains the element `a[r]`, `old` remains unchanged in `done` if it was there, and `old` is added to `extra` if it was not there.
