Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `a[r]` is currently in `done`, `old` is in `extra` and not in `done`, `old` is added to `todo` and removed from `done`, `a[r]` is no longer in `todo`**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `a[r]` was previously in `todo` and not in `done`, adding it to `done` means it is now in `done`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
