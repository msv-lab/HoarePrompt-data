Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `todo` does not contain `a[0]`, `done` now contains `a[0]` and `a[j]`, and `extra` contains `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of list `a` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is 2, the element `a[2]` is added to `done`. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
