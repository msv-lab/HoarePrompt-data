Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`**.

In this case, the code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. Since `r` is equal to `m`, the expression `r - m` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `old` is assigned the value of `a[0]`. The values of `r`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
