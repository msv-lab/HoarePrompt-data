Output State: **`j` is 0; `a` is a list of integers; the first element of `a` is now in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of list `a` to the set `extra`. Given that `j` is initially 0, the first element of `a` is added to `extra`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
