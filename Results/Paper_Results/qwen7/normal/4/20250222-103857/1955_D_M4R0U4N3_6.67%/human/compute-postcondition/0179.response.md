Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `r` will be equal to `n-1`. `m` is some integer, and `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `done` will contain `a[r]`, and `extra` will remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` will contain `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` will remain unchanged. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0. All elements of `a` that were not added to `done` will be in `extra`. The set `done` will contain all unique elements from `a` that were present in `todo` during the loop's execution.
