Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `old` remains in `extra` and `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `old` is removed from `extra` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, and `extra` includes `a[r]` while `done` includes `old`. Additionally, the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.
