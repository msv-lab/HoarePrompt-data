Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` is not in `extra`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `old` is in `extra`, `ans` becomes 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` remains 0; `r` is still `m`; `old` is added to `done`; `old` is no longer in `extra`.
