Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, num_test_cases is the number of test cases (an integer), n, m, and k are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers.**

Explanation: The initial state of `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The `input()` function is called and returns the number of test cases, which is stored in `num_test_cases`. The next line of code reads three space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()`, and these values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These three integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The precondition that `num_test_cases` must be at least 1 is also maintained.
