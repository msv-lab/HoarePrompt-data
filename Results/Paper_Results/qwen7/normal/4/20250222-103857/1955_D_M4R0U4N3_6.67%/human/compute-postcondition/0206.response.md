Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, `todo` removes `a[j]` and adds `a[j]` to `done`. If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `extra` includes the value of `a[j]`.**
