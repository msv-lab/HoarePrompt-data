Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `j` is `j + 1`, `todo` has removed the element `a[j]` from itself**.

This means that the element `a[j]` has been removed from the set `todo`. All other variables retain their previous states.
