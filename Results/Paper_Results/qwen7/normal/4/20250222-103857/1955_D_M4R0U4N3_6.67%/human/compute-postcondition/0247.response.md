Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `todo` has removed `a[r]` from it; if `old` is in `extra`, then `extra` has had `old` removed from it. Otherwise, `todo` contains `old`, and `done` has removed `old` if `old` was in `done`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
