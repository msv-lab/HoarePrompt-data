Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `extra` contains the element `a[1]`, `todo` does not contain the element `a[0]`, and `done` does not contain the element `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code adds `a[j]` to the `extra` set. Given that `j` was initially 1, `j` is now incremented to 2. Since `a[0]` is not in `todo`, `a[0]` is added to `extra`, and no changes are made to `todo` or `done`.
