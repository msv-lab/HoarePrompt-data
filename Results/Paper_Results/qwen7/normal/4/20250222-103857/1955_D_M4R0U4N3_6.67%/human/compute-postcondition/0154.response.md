Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `extra` list remains unchanged, `done` list has the element `a[r]` added, `todo` list has had the element `a[r]` removed.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the `done` list. The other variables and lists remain unchanged from their initial states.
