Output State: **`r` is `m`, `old` is either in `extra` and `done`, or remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, and `done` now contains `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `r` is `m`, `done` now includes `a[m]`. The values of `old`, `todo`, and their relationships remain unchanged.
