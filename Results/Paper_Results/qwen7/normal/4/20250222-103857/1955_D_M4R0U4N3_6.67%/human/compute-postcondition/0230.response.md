Output State: **`ans` is 0, `r` is `m`, `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, `extra` contains `a[r]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet adds `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This means that `a[r]` is now in `extra`. According to the conditions given in the initial state, if `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is in `extra`, then `ans` remains 0 if the length of `done` is less than `k - 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the length of `done`, we assume it is less than `k - 1` for this case, making `ans` remain 0. The other variables (`r`, `todo`, `old`) are updated accordingly.
