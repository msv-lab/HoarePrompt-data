Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `todo` has added `a[r]` to it; `done` has added `a[r]` to it.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `r`, `todo`, or `extra`. However, it changes the contents of the `done` set by adding the element `a[r]`. The condition for `ans` remains the same, and `r` remains `m + 1`. `todo` now includes `a[r]` since it has removed `a[r]` previously and now adds it back.
