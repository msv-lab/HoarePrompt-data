Output: **min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)**

Explanation: 
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it is not used in the calculation of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`.
- `ans2` is calculated as `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.

The `print` statement outputs the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`. Therefore, the output is `min(a * n, b * n // 2 + a * n % 2)`.
