Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**: We know from the problem statement that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` should return a value within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `int(input())` must return a value within the specified range. Since `t` is the value that will be input, we need to ensure that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
