Output State: **`t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `b` is the third input integer, `ans1` is \(a \times n\), `ans2` is \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\), the next input value must be greater than 0, `ans2` is updated to \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\).**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or the next input value. It only updates `ans2` to the same expression it was previously set to, which is \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\). Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the confirmation that `ans2` is now explicitly set to its calculated value.
