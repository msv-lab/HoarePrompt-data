Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Calculation of Costs**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - `ans1` is calculated as the total cost without any promotion, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is calculated as the total cost with the promotion applied optimally. This is done by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b * n // 2`) and then buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price (`a * n % 2`).
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a` because there's no way to use the promotion.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum cost for each test case using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

### Edge Cases and Validation:
- The program handles the edge case when `n` is 1 correctly by printing `a`.
- The logic for calculating `ans2` ensures that the promotion is used optimally by buying as many pairs as possible and then handling the remaining yogurts individually.
- The program does not have any logical errors based on the provided problem statement and examples.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular and promotional prices.

**Correctness: True**
