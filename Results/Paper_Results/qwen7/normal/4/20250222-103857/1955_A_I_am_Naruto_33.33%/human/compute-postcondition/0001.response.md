Output State: **`t` must be within the range 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still must be within the specified range.
