Output State: **`t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans2` based on the given formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `ans1` was previously defined as `a * n`, and now `ans2` is calculated using the provided formula.
