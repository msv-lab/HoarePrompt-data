Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `a` is the second input integer.
- `b` is the third input integer.
- `ans1` is \(a \times n\).
- `ans2` is \(b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2\).
- The next input value must be greater than 0.
- After the next input, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reassigned with new values from the input split into integers.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`, which is the second input integer.

Output: **a (where a is the second input integer)**
