Output State: **`t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans2` based on the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Since the initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are taken as input integers, and `ans1` is already calculated as `a * n`, the value of `ans2` is now updated according to the given formula. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
