Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than half the single yogurt price `a`. In such cases, it is always cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at price `a` rather than using the promotion. However, the program does not account for this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 5 10
```
The expected output should be 20 (since buying two yogurts at 10 burles each is cheaper than buying four yogurts at 5 burles each). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as 15 (using the formula `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).

To fix this, the program should include a condition to check if `b` is less than `a / 2` and adjust the calculation accordingly.
