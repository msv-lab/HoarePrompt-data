Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers: n, a, and b. The function returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a range defined by `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each iteration, it processes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). However, since the function definition does not specify the exact operations or return type, the focus is solely on the parameters and their implications.
