Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers that were input for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration where `n > 1`, `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. The final output will be the minimum value between `ans1` and `ans2` for each valid `n > 1`. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the output for that iteration is simply `a`.**

This means that after all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last inputs provided to the loop, and the output will consist of the minimum values computed for each valid `n > 1` according to the given formulas.
