Output State: **`t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n, a, b` are assigned the values from the input, `ans1` is `a * n`, `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a * n` to `ans1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. The condition for `ans2` (which is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` if `n` is greater than 1) is not checked or updated here, so it remains as a conditional expression based on the value of `n`.
