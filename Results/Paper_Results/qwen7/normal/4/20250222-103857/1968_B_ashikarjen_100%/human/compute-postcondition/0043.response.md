Output State: `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `m-1`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` for each iteration.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration, `n` remains unchanged as it was initially greater than or equal to 1 and was not affected by the loop, `j` will keep incrementing by 1 until it reaches `m-1`, and the condition `b[j] != a[i]` must hold true for every step of the loop until `j` is no longer less than `m`.
