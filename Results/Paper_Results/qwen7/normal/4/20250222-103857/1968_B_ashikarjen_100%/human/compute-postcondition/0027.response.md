Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, `j + 1` is less than `m`, and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given that initially `j` was increased by 1, now `j` is increased by 2 in total. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
