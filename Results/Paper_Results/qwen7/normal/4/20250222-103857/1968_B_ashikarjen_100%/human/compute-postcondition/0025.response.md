Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, `j` is less than `m - 1`, and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`, and `j` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `j` is now one more than its previous value, while `i` and `n` remain as they were initially, and the condition involving `b[j + 1]` and `a[i]` also remains unchanged.
