You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the prefix of string `a` does not match any subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the program increments `k` whenever it finds a matching character in `b`, but it does not account for the possibility that the next character in `a` might not match any subsequent character in `b`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 4
101
1001
```

The program will output `2`, because it finds a match for the first two characters of `a` ('10') in `b` ('1001'). However, the correct answer should be `1`, because the prefix '101' of `a` cannot be a subsequence of `b` since '101' requires three characters in `b`, but the longest matching prefix is only '10'.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it checks for the longest possible subsequence in `b` that matches the prefix of `a`. This can be achieved by using a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a more careful matching process.
