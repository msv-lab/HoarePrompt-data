Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1 and `j` must still be less than `m` and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[0]`.**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so it must now be less than `m` and also must not be equal to `a[0]` (since `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[0]`).
