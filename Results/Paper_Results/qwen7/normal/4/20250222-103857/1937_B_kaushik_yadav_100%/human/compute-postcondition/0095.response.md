Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `a` is unchanged.**

The code simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `work`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
