Postcondition: `i` is either `i + 1` or `i + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with the character `b[i]` or `b[i-1]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is appended with the character `b[i]`; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 2 and `ans` is appended with the character `a[i-1]`.
