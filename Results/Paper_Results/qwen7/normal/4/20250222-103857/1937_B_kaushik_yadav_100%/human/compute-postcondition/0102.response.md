Postcondition: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0]`, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and either `i + 1` is greater than or equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`**
