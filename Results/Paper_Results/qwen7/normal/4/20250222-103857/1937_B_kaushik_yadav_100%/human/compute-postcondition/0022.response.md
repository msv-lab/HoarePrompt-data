Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string, `work` is True. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the concatenation of its original value and the character at index `i` in `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `a`, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.
