You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

                i += 1
        print(ans)
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and two binary strings of length \( n \). For each test case, it constructs a new string \( ans \) by concatenating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it prints the constructed string \( ans \) for each case and outputs the maximum consecutive count of matching characters between the two input strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program does not consider all possible paths and their contributions to the lexicographically smallest string and the count of such paths.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Path Construction**: The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always preferring the current character from the top row (`a`) unless the current character from the top row is greater than the next character from the bottom row (`b`). However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest string for all cases. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   01
   10
   ```
   The program will construct the string `01` but the correct lexicographically smallest string should be `00`.

2. **Incorrect Path Count Calculation**: The program calculates the number of paths yielding the lexicographically smallest string by simply counting consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b`. This is insufficient because it does not account for all valid paths that could lead to the lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the above example, the program would incorrectly count only one path (`01`) instead of considering both paths (`00` and `01`).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the grid:
```
01
10
```
- The program constructs the string `01`.
- The correct lexicographically smallest string should be `00`.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
