Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0] + b[2]`, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `i + 1` is equal to the length of `a` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
