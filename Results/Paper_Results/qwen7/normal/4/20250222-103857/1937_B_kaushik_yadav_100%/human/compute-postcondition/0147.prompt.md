Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `a` is unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is either `a[0]`, `a[0] + b[2]`, or the first character of `b`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0. If `work` is True, `i` is either 2 or 3 based on specific conditions involving characters in `a` and `b`. If `work` is False, `i` is 2, `ans` is the first character of `b`, and `work` is set to False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is either `a[0] + a[i]`, `a[0] + b[2]`, or the first character of `b`, `work` is either False or remains unchanged, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 3. If `work` is True and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `ans` is set to `a[0] + a[i + 1]` and `work` is set to False. Otherwise, `i` is set to either 3 or 4, and `work` remains unchanged. If `work` is False, `ans` is set to `a[0] + b[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is either 4 or 5, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is either `a[0] + a[i]`, `a[0] + b[i-1]`, or `a[0] + b[i]`, `work` is either False or remains unchanged, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 3. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i-1] < a[i]`, then `i` remains 4 and `ans` is `a[0] + a[5]`. Otherwise, `i` becomes 5 and `ans` is either `a[0] + a[6]` or `a[0] + b[4]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
