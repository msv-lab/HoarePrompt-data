Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0] + a[i+1]`, `work` is either False or remains unchanged, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 3, so after the increment, `i` becomes 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
