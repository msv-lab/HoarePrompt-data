Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a string with the character `a[i-1]` appended to it, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, and `work` is a boolean.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
