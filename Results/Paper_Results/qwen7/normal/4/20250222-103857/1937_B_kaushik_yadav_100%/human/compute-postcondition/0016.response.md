Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is True, and either `i + 1` is greater than or equal to the length of `a` or the character at index `i` in `b` is greater than or equal to the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.
