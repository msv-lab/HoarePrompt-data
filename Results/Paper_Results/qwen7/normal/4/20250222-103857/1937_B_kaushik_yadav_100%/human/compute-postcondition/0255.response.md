Postcondition: **`counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False based on the conditions inside the if-else blocks, `ans` is the final concatenated string formed by adding characters from `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified within the loop, `j` is 1, and `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition (`a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`) is met or not, the values of `counter`, `i`, `work`, `ans`, and `j` remain as described in the precondition, and `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`.
