Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0] + b[i]`, `work` is either False or remains unchanged, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the character at index `i` of `b` to the current value of `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans` will be updated to `a[0] + b[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
