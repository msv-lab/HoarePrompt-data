Output State: **`counter` is 3, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Given that `counter` was initially 2, after executing this line, `counter` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
