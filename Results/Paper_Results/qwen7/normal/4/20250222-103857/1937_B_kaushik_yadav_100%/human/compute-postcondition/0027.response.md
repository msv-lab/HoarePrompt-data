Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `work` is False**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, and `work`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
