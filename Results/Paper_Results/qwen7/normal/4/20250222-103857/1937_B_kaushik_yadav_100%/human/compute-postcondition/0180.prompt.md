Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is a string constructed according to the rules defined within the loop, `work` is False, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than or equal to the value of `i`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`; otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]` and the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is false. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, `t`) retain their original states.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `counter` is either 3 or 1 depending on the conditions. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` remains as 3. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` initially, and `a[j + 2]` equals `b[j + 1]`, then `counter` becomes 1. In all other cases, `counter` becomes 2. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, `t`) retain their original states, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `counter` is either 3 or 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `t` retain their original states. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is either 4 or 2. If `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
