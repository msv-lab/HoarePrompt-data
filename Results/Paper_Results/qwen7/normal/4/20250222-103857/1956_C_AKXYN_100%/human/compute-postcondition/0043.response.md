Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Values**:
   - `res` is explicitly given as 140.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). Since no specific value is given, we don't need to know the exact value of `t` for this particular print statement.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 7.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 6.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The print statement is `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - `'2 %d' % i` formats the string with the value of `i` (which is 6), so it becomes `'2 6'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object from 1 to `n + 1` (which is 8), resulting in the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - Combining these parts, the print statement will output `'2 6'` followed by the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.

Output: **'2 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7'**
