Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 7, `i` is `n`.

To calculate the final value of `res`, we can observe the pattern in the loop. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, and in each iteration, it adds `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`. We can sum these terms from `i = 0` to `i = n-1` to find the total value of `res` after all iterations.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration, `res` is 6.
- After 2 iterations, `res` is 24.
- After 3 iterations, `res` is 36.

We can continue this pattern:
- For 4 iterations, `res` would be 36 + (4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 36 + 5 * 9 = 81.
- For 5 iterations, `res` would be 81 + (5 + 1) * (2 * 5 + 1) = 81 + 6 * 11 = 147.
- For 6 iterations, `res` would be 147 + (6 + 1) * (2 * 6 + 1) = 147 + 7 * 13 = 212.
- For 7 iterations, `res` would be 212 + (7 + 1) * (2 * 7 + 1) = 212 + 8 * 15 = 292.

However, the exact formula for the sum of the series \((i+1)(2i+1)\) from \(i=0\) to \(i=n-1\) is known to be \(\frac{n(2n^2 + 3n - 1)}{3}\). Plugging in \(n=7\):

\[ \text{res} = \frac{7(2*7^2 + 3*7 - 1)}{3} = \frac{7(98 + 21 - 1)}{3} = \frac{7*118}{3} = \frac{826}{3} = 140 \]

Thus, after all iterations, `res` is 140, `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 7, and `i` will be `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be 7, `i` is `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 7, `i` is 6

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 7, `i` is 5




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
