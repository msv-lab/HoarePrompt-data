Output State: **`res` is 24, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `res` is 6.
- The code updates `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`.
- Given `i` is 2, the calculation becomes `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`.
- Therefore, `res` is updated to `6 + 15 = 24`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
