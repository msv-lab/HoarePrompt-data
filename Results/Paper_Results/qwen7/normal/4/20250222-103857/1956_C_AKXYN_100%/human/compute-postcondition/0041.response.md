Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time (`range(n, 0, -1)`).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 140
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be 7
   - `i` is `n` (which is 7)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 7 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 6 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the range.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `res` remains unchanged at 140.
   - `t` remains unchanged within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` remains 7.
   - `i` changes to 6.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 7, `i` is 6**
