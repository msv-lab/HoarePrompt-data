Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 140 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` is 7 (this variable is part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 6 (this variable is part of the loop head).

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `n` to 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 6.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must decrease by 1, making it 5.
   - Since `n` is constant within the loop, it remains 7.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `res` remains 140.
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` remains 7.
   - `i` is now 5.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 7, `i` is 5**
