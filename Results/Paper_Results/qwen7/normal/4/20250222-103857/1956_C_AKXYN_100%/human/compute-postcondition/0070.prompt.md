Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be equal to 6, `i` is 5, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on `res`. The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and in each iteration, it adds `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`. We need to find the value of `n` that makes `res` equal to 204 after all iterations.

Let's calculate the sum step-by-step for different values of `n`:

For `n = 1`:
\[ res = (0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 \]

For `n = 2`:
\[ res = 1 + (1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 1 + 2 * 3 = 7 \]

For `n = 3`:
\[ res = 7 + (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 7 + 3 * 5 = 22 \]

For `n = 4`:
\[ res = 22 + (3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 22 + 4 * 7 = 46 \]

For `n = 5`:
\[ res = 46 + (4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 46 + 5 * 9 = 91 \]

For `n = 6`:
\[ res = 91 + (5 + 1) * (2 * 5 + 1) = 91 + 6 * 11 = 157 \]

For `n = 7`:
\[ res = 157 + (6 + 1) * (2 * 6 + 1) = 157 + 7 * 13 = 234 \]

We can see that for `n = 6`, `res` is 157, and adding the next term for `i = 6` would exceed 204. Therefore, we need to check if there's any other way to reach exactly 204, but given the pattern and the problem constraints, the only feasible solution within the given range is when `n = 6` and the loop has completed all its iterations up to `i = 5`, making `res` equal to 204.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
    print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 5, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 4, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
