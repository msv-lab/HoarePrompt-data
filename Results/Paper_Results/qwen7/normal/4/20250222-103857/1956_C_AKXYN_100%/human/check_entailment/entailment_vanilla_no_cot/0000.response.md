Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to \( n \). This is done using a list comprehension where each row is initialized as a list of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of all elements in the matrix is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \). This formula comes from the fact that each element \( a_{i,j} \) in the matrix is set to \( j \) (or \( i \) when transposed), and the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is used to compute the total sum.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required, which is at most \( 2n \). It then performs the operations to achieve this sum by setting the rows and columns to permutations of the first \( n \) natural numbers.

4. **Operations**: The program prints \( n \) operations of type 1 and \( n \) operations of type 2. Each operation sets either a row or a column to the sequence \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

Given these points, the program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
