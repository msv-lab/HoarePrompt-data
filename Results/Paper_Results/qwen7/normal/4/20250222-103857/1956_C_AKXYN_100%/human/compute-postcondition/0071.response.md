Output State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` starts at 5 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop iterates from `i = 5` down to `i = 0`, it will run exactly 6 times (from 5 to 0 inclusive). Given that the value of `res` remains 204 throughout the iterations and does not change, and considering the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop, the final state of the variables will be as described above.
