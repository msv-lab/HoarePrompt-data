Based on the initial state and the given information:

- `res` is explicitly stated to be 140.
- `n` is explicitly stated to be 7 (since `i` is `n` and `i` starts from 0 to `n-1`, and the pattern matches with `n` being 7).
- The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the bits of `n` to the left by 1 position. Shifting 7 left by 1 gives \(7 \times 2 = 14\).

Therefore, the print statement will output the values of `res` and `n << 1`.

Output: **140, 14**
