Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `res` remains 1.
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`res` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
