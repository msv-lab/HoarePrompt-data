### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each element \( a_{i,j} \) in the matrix can be set to any value from 1 to \( n \).
   - Two types of operations are allowed:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix elements and prints the result along with the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - The sum of the matrix after initializing it with the sequence from 1 to \( n \) in each row is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i \times n) = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - This is indeed the maximum possible sum because each element can be at most \( n \).
   - The solution uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly by setting the single element to 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the solution sets each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \), which is a valid permutation and maximizes the sum.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the solution does not actually perform the operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

- The problem requires that the operations should be of the form:
  - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
  - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.

But the provided solution simply initializes the matrix with the sequence from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column, without performing any actual permutations. This means the operations printed are not valid according to the problem's definition.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not perform the required operations (permutations) as specified in the problem statement. Instead, it initializes the matrix directly, which does not involve any operations.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
