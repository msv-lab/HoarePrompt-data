Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 204 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (also not used in the print statement).
- `n` is 6.
- `i` is 3.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6 (again, `mat` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:
- `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i`, which is 3. So, `'1 %d' % i` becomes `'1 3'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)` expands the range function to print all numbers from 1 to `n + 1`, where `n` is 6. Therefore, it will print `1 2 3 4 5 6`.

Combining these, the print statement will output:
Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5 6**
