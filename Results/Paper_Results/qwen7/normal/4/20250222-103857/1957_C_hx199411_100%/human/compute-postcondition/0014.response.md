Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is `num + 1`, `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are input integers.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1 (`num += 1`). The value of `num` was either 1 or 2 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, so now `num` is either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
