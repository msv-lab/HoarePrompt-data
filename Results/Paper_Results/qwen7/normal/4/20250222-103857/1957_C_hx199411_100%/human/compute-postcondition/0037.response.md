Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1] = 1`, and `m` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[1]` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`, or the list `dp`. The list `dp` is initialized as a list of `m + 1` zeros, and now the first element of this list is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
