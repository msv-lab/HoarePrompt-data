To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `t`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero (`t != 0`).
2. **Current State**: 
   - `t` is `t - 2 * k`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`
   - `i` is `k - 1`
   - `c` and `r` are input integers
   - `m` is `n - num`

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must be non-zero.

Given that `t` is updated in each iteration by subtracting `2 * k`, the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`.

### Adjusting States:

- **`t`**: Since `t` is the condition for the loop, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can continue. Specifically, `t` should be greater than or equal to `2 * k` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to `2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`**
