Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop will iterate from `3` to `m + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is initially set to `k - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. Therefore, `i` must start at `k - 1` and should eventually reach a value such that it is still within the range `[3, m + 1]`.

4. **Check the range of `m`**: Given that `m = n - num`, and `num` is calculated based on the conditions involving `c` and `r`, we need to ensure that `m` is at least `3` for the loop to execute.

5. **Initial values and conditions**:
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with zeros except `dp[1]` is 1 and `dp[2]` is 3.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `r` is an input integer.
   - `num` is the final value calculated based on all the comparisons made during the loop.
   - `m` is `n - num`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `k - 1` and that `m` is at least `3` for the loop to execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` is `k - 1`.
- `m` must be at least `3` (since `m = n - num` and `num` is calculated based on the conditions involving `c` and `r`).

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `m` must be at least 3**.
