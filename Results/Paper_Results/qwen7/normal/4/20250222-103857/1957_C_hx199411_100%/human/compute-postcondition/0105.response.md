State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.
- For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0 because `range(k)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `k-1`, and if `k` is 0 or negative, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
- Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as the loop will start iterating from 0 up to `k-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `i` (initially set to 0).
