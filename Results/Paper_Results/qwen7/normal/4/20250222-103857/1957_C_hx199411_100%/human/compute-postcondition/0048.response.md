Postcondition: `t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0. If `m` equals 1, then `t` remains unchanged and `m` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i]` will be computed for all indices from 3 to `m` inclusive, following the rule `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. After all iterations, the list `dp` will contain `m + 1` elements, where `dp[1] = 1`, `dp[2] = 3`, and each subsequent element `dp[i]` for `i >= 3` is calculated based on the given formula, ensuring no overflow by taking modulo `10^9 + 7`.
