Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `num + 1` or 4 or 6 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, `i` is 2, `c` and `r` are input integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

The code reads two integers from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
