Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `i` is `k-1`
- `c` is an input integer from one of the inputs
- `r` is an input integer from the same input as `c`
- `num` is the final value calculated based on all the comparisons made during the loop
- `m` is `n - num`
- The current value of `m` is 1
- `m` is not equal to 0

The print statement is `print(1)`. This statement will simply print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
