Output State: **`m` is `n - num`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is the total sum of 1 added when `c` equals `r` and 2 added when `c` does not equal `r` for all iterations, `i` is `k + (k - 1)`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, and `i` is greater than `k`, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This list is created using a list comprehension where each element is initialized to 0. The values of `m`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
