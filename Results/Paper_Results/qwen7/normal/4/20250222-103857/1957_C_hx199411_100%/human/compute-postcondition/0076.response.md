Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `num` is either `num + 1` (if `c` equals `r`) or `num + 2` (if `c` does not equal `r`), `i` is `k + 1`, `c` and `r` are integers from the input, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are now integers from the input.
