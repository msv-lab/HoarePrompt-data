Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic used to update `num` is incorrect. The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks. However, the current implementation increments `num` by 1 if the row and column indices are the same (indicating a diagonal placement), and by 2 otherwise. This is incorrect because it does not properly account for the number of unique rows and columns.

For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 1
  1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output (with the given program):
  ```
  2
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates `num` as 2 instead of 1, leading to an incorrect calculation of `m` as 2. Consequently, the dynamic programming array `dp` is not initialized correctly, resulting in an incorrect final answer.

To fix this, `num` should be incremented by 1 for each unique row and column, regardless of whether the row and column indices are the same or not.
