Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `num + 2` or 6 or 8 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not, `i` is 4, `c` and `r` are input integers, `c` and `r` are assigned the values from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 2. The initial state of `num` is either `num + 1` or 4 or 6 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not. After adding 2 to `num`, the possible values of `num` become `num + 3` or 6 or 8 depending on whether `c` is equal to `r` or not. The value of `i` is updated to 4 because it was incremented by 2 (from 2 to 4). All other variables remain unchanged.
