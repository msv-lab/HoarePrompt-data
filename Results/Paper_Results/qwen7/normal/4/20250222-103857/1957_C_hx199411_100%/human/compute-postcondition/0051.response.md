Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, the function does nothing. If `m` is 1, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with the first two elements fixed as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and the rest of the elements filled according to the loop's computation rule, ensuring no overflow by taking modulo `10^9 + 7`.**
