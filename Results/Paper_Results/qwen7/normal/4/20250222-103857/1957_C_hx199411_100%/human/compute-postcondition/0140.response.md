Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(3, m + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `k - 2`
   - `m` must be at least 3
   - `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10`

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - The loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Continue**:
   - Since `i` is currently `k - 2`, the next value of `i` would be `k - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k - 1` must be less than or equal to `m`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `k - 1`.
   - `m` must still be at least 3.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `k - 1`.
   - `m` must still be at least 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `m` must be at least 3**
