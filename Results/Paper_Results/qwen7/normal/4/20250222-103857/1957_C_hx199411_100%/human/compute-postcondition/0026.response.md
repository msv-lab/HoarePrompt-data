Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * k`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either `k` or `2 * k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` and `r` are input integers, `m` is `n - num`**.

This means that after the loop, the variable `t` has been decremented by `2 * k`, `num` has been updated to either `k` or `2 * k` based on the conditions within the loop, `i` is now `k - 1`, and `m` is calculated as `n - num`. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
