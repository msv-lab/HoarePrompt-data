Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an input integer from one of the inputs, `r` is an input integer from the same input as `c`, and `num` is the final value calculated based on all the comparisons made during the loop, which is `2*k + (k - 1) if all `c` equals `r` or `2*k + 2*(k - 1) if any `c` does not equal `r`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains 0, `n` remains the original input integer, and `k` remains the original input integer. The variable `i` will be `k-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`. The variables `c` and `r` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the third iteration of the loop. The value of `num` will be the sum of 2 for each comparison (whether `c` equals `r` or not) plus 1 for each match, resulting in `2*k + (k - 1)` if all comparisons are matches or `2*k + 2*(k - 1)` if there is at least one mismatch.
