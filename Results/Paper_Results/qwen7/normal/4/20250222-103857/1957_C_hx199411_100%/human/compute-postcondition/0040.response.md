Output State: **`dp[i]' is calculated as (`dp[i - 1]' + (`i - 1') * `dp[i - 2]' * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7), while `dp[i - 1]' and `dp[i - 2]' retain their previous values**.

This means that the value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the formula provided, taking into account the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. The result is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
