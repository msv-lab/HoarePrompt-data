The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. This means the values of `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` remain unchanged from their initial states. 

- `total_space` is initially `y * 8 + x`.
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must still be greater than 2.
- `result` is still a list.
- `space_x` is still equal to `x * 1`.
- `space_y` is still equal to `y * 4`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is still calculated based on `y`.
- `remaining_cells` is still calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`.

After the code execution, `x` and `y` are updated with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on `y`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `x` is the first integer input, and `y` is the second integer input.**
