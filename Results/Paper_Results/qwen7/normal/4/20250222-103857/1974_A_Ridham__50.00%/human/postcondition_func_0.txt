The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 99) as input. Based on these values, it calculates the required screen space and any additional space needed. The function then constructs a list `result` containing the sum of the required screen space and any additional space for each test case where the available space (`space_x`) is insufficient to meet the required space (`remaining_cells`). Finally, it prints each element of the `result` list on a new line.
