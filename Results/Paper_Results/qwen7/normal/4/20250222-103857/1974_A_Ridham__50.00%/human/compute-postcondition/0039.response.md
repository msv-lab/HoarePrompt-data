Output State: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_space` which is defined as `space_x - remaining_cells`. We know `space_x` is `x * 1`, and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. Since `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`, it does not affect `extra_space`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
