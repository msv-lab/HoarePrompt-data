You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 99) as input. Based on these values, it calculates the required screen space and any additional space needed. The function then constructs a list `result` containing the sum of the required screen space and any additional space for each test case where the available space (`space_x`) is insufficient to meet the required space (`remaining_cells`). Finally, it prints each element of the `result` list on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, it fails to handle the placement of 1x1 icons efficiently. The logic for calculating `remaining_cells` and determining the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `10 0`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `1`

In this case, 10 icons of size 1x1 need to be placed. Since each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 * 3), 2 screens are required, but the program incorrectly outputs 1 screen.

The correct approach would involve calculating the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons and then determining how many additional screens are required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. Here’s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_y = y // 2
        # Remaining 2x2 spaces after placing full screens
        remaining_2x2_spaces = y % 2
        # Total spaces available in full screens
        total_spaces_in_full_screens = full_screens_for_y * 15
        # Spaces taken by 2x2 icons
        spaces_taken_by_2x2 = y * 4
        # Remaining spaces after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_spaces = total_spaces_in_full_screens - spaces_taken_by_2x2
        # Number of 1x1 icons that can fit in remaining spaces
        icons_fitting_in_remaining_spaces = min(x, remaining_spaces)
        # Remaining 1x1 icons that need their own screens
        remaining_1x1_icons = x - icons_fitting_in_remaining_spaces
        # Additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (remaining_1x1_icons + 14) // 15
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = full_screens_for_y + additional_screens_for_1x1
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of screens required accurately for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
