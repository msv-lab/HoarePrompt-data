Output State: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `remaining_cells` to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. Since `space_y` is already defined as `y * 4`, the new value of `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
