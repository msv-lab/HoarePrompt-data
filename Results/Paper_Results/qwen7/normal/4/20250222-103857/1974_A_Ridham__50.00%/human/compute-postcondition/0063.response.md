Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and `result` is a list containing the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each iteration where `space_x` was greater than `remaining_cells`. For each iteration, `space_x` is set to `x * 1` and `space_y` is set to `y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `screen_require_for_y` is added to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is added to `result`, where `extra_screen` is either `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise. The final state of `t`, `n`, `total_space`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space` remains as defined in the precondition.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `result` will contain the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each input pair `(x, y)` where `space_x` was not enough to meet `remaining_cells`. `t` and `n` will reflect the initial conditions and the number of inputs processed, respectively.
