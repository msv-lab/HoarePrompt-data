Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and `result` is a list containing the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each iteration where `space_x` was greater than `remaining_cells`. For each iteration, `space_x` is set to `x * 1` and `space_y` is set to `y * 4`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `screen_require_for_y` is added to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is added to `result`, where `extra_screen` is either `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` otherwise. The final state of `t`, `n`, `total_space`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_space` remains as defined in the precondition.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `result` will contain the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each input pair `(x, y)` where `space_x` was not enough to meet `remaining_cells`. `t` and `n` will reflect the initial conditions and the number of inputs processed, respectively.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 99) as input. Based on these values, it calculates the required screen space and any additional space needed. The function then constructs a list `result` containing the sum of the required screen space and any additional space for each test case where the available space (`space_x`) is insufficient to meet the required space (`remaining_cells`). Finally, it prints each element of the `result` list on a new line.
