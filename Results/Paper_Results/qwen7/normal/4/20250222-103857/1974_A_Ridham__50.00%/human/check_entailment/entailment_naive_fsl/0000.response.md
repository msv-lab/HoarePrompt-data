Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, it fails to handle the placement of 1x1 icons efficiently. The logic for calculating `remaining_cells` and determining the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `10 0`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `1`

In this case, 10 icons of size 1x1 need to be placed. Since each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 * 3), 2 screens are required, but the program incorrectly outputs 1 screen.

The correct approach would involve calculating the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons and then determining how many additional screens are required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_y = y // 2
        # Remaining 2x2 spaces after placing full screens
        remaining_2x2_spaces = y % 2
        # Total spaces available in full screens
        total_spaces_in_full_screens = full_screens_for_y * 15
        # Spaces taken by 2x2 icons
        spaces_taken_by_2x2 = y * 4
        # Remaining spaces after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_spaces = total_spaces_in_full_screens - spaces_taken_by_2x2
        # Number of 1x1 icons that can fit in remaining spaces
        icons_fitting_in_remaining_spaces = min(x, remaining_spaces)
        # Remaining 1x1 icons that need their own screens
        remaining_1x1_icons = x - icons_fitting_in_remaining_spaces
        # Additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (remaining_1x1_icons + 14) // 15
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = full_screens_for_y + additional_screens_for_1x1
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of screens required accurately for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
