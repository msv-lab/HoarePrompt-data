Postcondition: `extra_screen` and `total_space` are updated based on the divisibility of `space_x` by 15. If `space_x` is divisible by 15, `extra_screen` is set to `space_x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is set to `extra_space // 15 + 1`. `total_space` remains as `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
