Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Here's why:

1. **Space Calculation**: The program calculates `space_x` as `x * 1` and `space_y` as `y * 4`, which is correct since a 1x1 icon takes 1 cell and a 2x2 icon takes 4 cells. However, the logic for determining the number of screens needed is flawed.

2. **Screen Requirement Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`). It should consider that each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and the total space available per screen is 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The calculation of `remaining_cells` is incorrect. It should be calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

4. **Final Screen Calculation**: The final screen requirement should account for both the 1x1 and 2x2 icons together. The current logic does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Total space required for 2x2 icons
        space_y = y * 4
        # Total space required for 1x1 icons
        space_x = x * 1
        # Total space required
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 3) // 4  # Ceiling division to ensure all 2x2 icons fit
        # Calculate remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        extra_screens = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // 15  # Ceiling division to ensure all 1x1 icons fit
        # Total screens required
        total_screens = screen_require_for_y + extra_screens
        result.append(total_screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
