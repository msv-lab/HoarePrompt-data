Postcondition: `total_space` is now `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, depending on whether `y` is even or odd.
