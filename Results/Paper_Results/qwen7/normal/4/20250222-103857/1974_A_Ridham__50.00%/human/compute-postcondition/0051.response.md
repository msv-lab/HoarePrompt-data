Output State: **`total_space` is now `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 2, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
