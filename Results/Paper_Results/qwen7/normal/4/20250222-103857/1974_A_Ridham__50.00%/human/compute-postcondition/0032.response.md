Output State: **`total_space` is `y * 8 + x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, if `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`**.

Explanation: The code updates `total_space` to be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. Initially, `total_space` was defined as `y * 4 + x`. After the code runs, `space_y` is updated to `y * 4`, so `total_space` becomes `space_y + space_x`, which is `y * 4 + x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
