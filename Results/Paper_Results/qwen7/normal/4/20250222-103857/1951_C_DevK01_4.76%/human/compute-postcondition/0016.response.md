Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M` decreased by 1, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

This means that the variable `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, where `n` is now one less than its original value due to the operation `n -= 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships as described.
