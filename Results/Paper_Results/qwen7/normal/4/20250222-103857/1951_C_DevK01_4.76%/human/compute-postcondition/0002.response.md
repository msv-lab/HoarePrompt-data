Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `L`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `a` is updated to contain the integers from the input.
