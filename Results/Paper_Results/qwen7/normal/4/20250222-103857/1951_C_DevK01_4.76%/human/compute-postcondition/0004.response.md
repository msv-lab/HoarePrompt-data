Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is L[0], `m` is L[1], `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first three elements of the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `M` remain unchanged from their initial state.
