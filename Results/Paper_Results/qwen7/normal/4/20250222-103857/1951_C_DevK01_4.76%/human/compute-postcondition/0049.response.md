Output State: **`t` is `t_prev - 1`, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` remains the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (excluding the last element in the else part), `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `N` is `M[:q]`**.

This means that the list `N` now contains the first `q` elements of the list `M`, where `q` is calculated as `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. All other variables retain their previous values.
