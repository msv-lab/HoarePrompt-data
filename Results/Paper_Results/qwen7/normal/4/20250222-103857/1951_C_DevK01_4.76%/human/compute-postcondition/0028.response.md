Output State: **`t` is `t_prev + 1`, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `L[2] / L[1]`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `m` is updated to the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The code `m = min(m, k)` updates the value of `m` to be the minimum between its current value (`m`) and the value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
