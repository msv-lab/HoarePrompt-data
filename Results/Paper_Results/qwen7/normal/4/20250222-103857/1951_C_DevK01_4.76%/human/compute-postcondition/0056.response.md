Output State: **`t` is `t_prev - 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` remains the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is now the length of `N`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `cost` variable by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `cost` is the sum of the original `cost` and the calculated expression. The length of `N` is updated to reflect the number of elements remaining in `N` after the operation.
