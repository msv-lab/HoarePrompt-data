Reasoning:
1. The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by sorting the ticket prices and then determining the optimal strategy to minimize the total cost.
2. The logic involves dividing the total number of tickets `k` into groups based on the maximum tickets that can be bought per day `m`, and then calculating the cost for each group.
3. The solution correctly handles the scenario where the total number of tickets `k` is exactly divisible by `m` and when it is not.
4. The solution uses a greedy approach to minimize the cost by buying as many tickets as possible each day until the total number of tickets `k` is met.
5. The code seems to handle the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
