Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `n` is decreased by 1, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` pops the last element from the list `N` and assigns it to `w`. The length of `N` (which was `n`) is now reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
