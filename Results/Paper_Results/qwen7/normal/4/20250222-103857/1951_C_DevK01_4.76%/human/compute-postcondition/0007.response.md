Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is L[0], `m` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `k` is L[2], `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`**.

This means that the variable `q` has been calculated as the ceiling value of the division of `k` by `m`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
