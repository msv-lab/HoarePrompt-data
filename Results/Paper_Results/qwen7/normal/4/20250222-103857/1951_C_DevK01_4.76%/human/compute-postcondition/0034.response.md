Output State: **`t` is `t_prev + 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained and sorted, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and `m` is updated to the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The code `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `N`. Since the last element of `N` was `w`, after this operation, `N` will have one less element. All other variables remain unchanged.
