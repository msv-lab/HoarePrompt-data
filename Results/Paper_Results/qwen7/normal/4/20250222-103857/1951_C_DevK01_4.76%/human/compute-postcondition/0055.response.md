Output State: **`t` is `t_prev - 1`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` remains the minimum value between `L[1]` and `k`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `L` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`, `n` is now the length of `N`.**

Explanation: The code updates `n` to be the length of the list `N`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
