Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `M`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
