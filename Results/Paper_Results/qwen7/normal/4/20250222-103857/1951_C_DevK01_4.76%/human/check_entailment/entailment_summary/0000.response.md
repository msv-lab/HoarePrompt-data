Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. It extracts the necessary parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `M`) for each test case.
3. The program sorts the list `M` and then determines the number of days (`q`) required to buy at least `k` tickets, considering the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought per day.
4. It handles two main scenarios:
   - When the number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days equals `k`.
   - When the number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is less than `k`.
5. In both scenarios, the program correctly calculates the cost by considering the increased prices due to the ticket hoarding rule.
6. The program then prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the program, it appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
