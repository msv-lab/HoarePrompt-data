Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of integers. If the sum of the first three elements of `v` is odd, then no change is made to `t` and `v`. Otherwise, `result` is calculated as `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`, and this result is used in some unspecified way, while `t` remains greater than 1.
