### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Score Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point each in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the function prints `-1` immediately, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`: The difference in points between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: Ensures that we do not subtract a negative value, which would make the numerator invalid.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws because each draw adds 2 points to the total score (1 point to each player).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of scores is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is incorrect. Specifically, the term `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` does not accurately represent the points that need to be accounted for in terms of draws and wins.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Formula Derivation:**
  - To maximize the number of draws, we need to ensure that the points are distributed such that the maximum number of draws (each contributing 2 points) is maximized.
  - The correct approach involves ensuring that the points are distributed in a way that minimizes the number of wins (since each win contributes only 2 points to the total score, while a draw contributes 2 points to the total score).

- **Revised Formula:**
  - The correct formula to find the maximum number of draws is:
    \[
    \text{result} = \frac{2 \times (\text{total points} - \text{max points})}{2} = \text{total points} - \text{max points}
    \]
  - Where `total points = v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` and `max points = v[2]`.

- **Corrected Code:**
  ```python
  def func():
      t = int(input())
      for _ in range(t):
          v = list(map(int, input().split()))
          if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
              print('-1')
          else:
              result = v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - v[2]
              print(result)
  ```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was incorrect because the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is flawed. The corrected formula should be `result = v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - v[2]`. The original program does not correctly compute the maximum number of draws.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
