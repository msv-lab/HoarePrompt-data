Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list `v`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `v` is now a list of integers based on the user's input.
