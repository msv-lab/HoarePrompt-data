### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and stores them in a list `v`.

2. **Score Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point each in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the function prints `-1` immediately, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]`: The difference in points between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: Ensures that we do not subtract a negative value, which would make the numerator invalid.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws because each draw adds 2 points to the total score (1 point to each player).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of scores is odd correctly by printing `-1`.
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws should theoretically cover all valid scenarios where the scores can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to find the maximum number of draws. There are no apparent errors in the code.

### Correctness:
