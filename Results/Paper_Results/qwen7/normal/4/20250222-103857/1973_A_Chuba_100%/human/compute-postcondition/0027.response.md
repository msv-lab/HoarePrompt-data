Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of these integers is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\); otherwise, it calculates a specific value based on the integers and prints that value. After processing all test cases, the function ends with the variable `t` set to 0 and no further values of `v` to process.**
