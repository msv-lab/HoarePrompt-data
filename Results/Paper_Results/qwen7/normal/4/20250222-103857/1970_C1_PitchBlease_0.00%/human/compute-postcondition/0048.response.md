Postcondition: `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes the `neighbor` that was just processed, and `queue` now contains tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for each unvisited neighbor of `current`.
