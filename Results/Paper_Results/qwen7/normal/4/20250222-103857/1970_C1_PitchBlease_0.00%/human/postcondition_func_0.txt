The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the tree's edges, and an integer `start` indicating the starting node. It constructs a fully interconnected representation of the tree and identifies its two leaves. The function then calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using breadth-first search (BFS). If either of these distances is even, the function returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
