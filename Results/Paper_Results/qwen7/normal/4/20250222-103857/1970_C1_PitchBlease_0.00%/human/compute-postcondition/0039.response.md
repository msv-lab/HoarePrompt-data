Output State: **`dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and after executing the if statement, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` has added the `neighbor`.**

This means that the `visited` set now includes the `neighbor` node, and the `queue` now contains a tuple with the `neighbor` and the updated distance (`dist + 1`). All other variables remain in their original state relative to the initial conditions.
