Postcondition: `current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, and if `neighbor` (an element of `tree[current]`) is not in `visited`, then `visited` includes the element `neighbor`, and `queue` now includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.
