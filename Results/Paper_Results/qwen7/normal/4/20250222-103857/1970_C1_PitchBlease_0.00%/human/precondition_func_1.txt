start is an integer representing the starting node, and target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. Both start and target are within the range 1 to n (inclusive), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The variable tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where tree[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of node i.
