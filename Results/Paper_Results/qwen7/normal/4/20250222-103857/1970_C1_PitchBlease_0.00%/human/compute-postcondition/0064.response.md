Output State: **`current` is the first element of `queue`, `dist` is the second element of `queue`, `queue` is the remaining elements of `queue` after removing the first element, `tree` must have at least one neighbor for `current`, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and `neighbor` has been added to `visited`.**

Explanation: The code adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set. This does not change the values of `current`, `dist`, `queue`, `tree`, or `neighbor`, but it updates the state of `visited` to include the newly visited node (`neighbor`).
