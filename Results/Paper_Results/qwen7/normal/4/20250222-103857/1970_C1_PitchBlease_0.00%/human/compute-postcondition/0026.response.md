Output State: The `current` node will be the node that is closest to the `target` node among all nodes that have been visited, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, and `queue` is a list containing tuples `(neighbor, dist + 1)` for all unvisited neighbors of the current node, where `neighbor` is a node adjacent to the current node and `dist` is the distance from the `start` node to the `neighbor` node.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `current` will be the node closest to the `target` that has been fully explored (i.e., all its neighbors have been added to the queue or marked as visited), `visited` will include all nodes that have been visited during the search, and `queue` will contain tuples for all unvisited neighbors of the current node, ensuring that the shortest path to each node is considered.
