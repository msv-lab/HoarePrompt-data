Output State: **`dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor, the `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set, and `visited` now includes the `neighbor`, `queue` now contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

This means that the `queue` has been updated to include a new element, which is a tuple consisting of the `neighbor` and `dist + 1`. The `dist + 1` represents the distance from the `start` to the `neighbor` through the current node. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
