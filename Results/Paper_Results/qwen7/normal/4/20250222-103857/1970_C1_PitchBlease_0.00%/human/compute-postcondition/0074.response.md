Output State: The `current` variable is the first element of the `queue`, `dist` is the second element of the `queue` incremented by the number of times the loop has executed, `queue` is the list of remaining elements in the `queue` after removing the first element, and `visited` contains all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, with each node's distance from the start recorded in the `queue`. The `tree` structure remains unchanged, and the loop continues to process neighbors of the current node until the `queue` is empty or the `target` node is found and returned.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `current` will be the first node in the final `queue`, `dist` will be the distance from the start node to `current` plus the number of iterations the loop ran, `queue` will contain all unvisited nodes and their distances from the start node, `visited` will include all nodes that were processed, and the `tree` structure will remain as it was initially.
