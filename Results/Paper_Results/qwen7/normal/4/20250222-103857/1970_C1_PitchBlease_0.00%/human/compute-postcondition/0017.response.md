Output State: **`current` is the first neighbor of `start` in the adjacency list of `tree[start]`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `current`, and `queue` is a list containing a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` where `neighbor` is the current neighbor of `start` and `dist` is the distance from `start` to this neighbor.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. Here, `neighbor` is the current neighbor of `start` (which is stored in the variable `current`), and `dist` is the distance from `start` to this neighbor (which is stored in the variable `dist`). The `queue` now contains this new tuple along with the previously existing tuples. The other variables (`start`, `target`, `visited`) remain unchanged.
