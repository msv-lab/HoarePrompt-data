Output State: **`dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `current` is the current node being processed, `tree[current]` must contain at least one neighbor that is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes the `neighbor` that was just processed, and `queue` now contains a tuple `(new_neighbor, dist + 1)` where `new_neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor of `current`; `visited` has added the `neighbor` to itself.**

In this step, the code adds the `neighbor` to the `visited` set, which means the `neighbor` is now marked as visited. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
