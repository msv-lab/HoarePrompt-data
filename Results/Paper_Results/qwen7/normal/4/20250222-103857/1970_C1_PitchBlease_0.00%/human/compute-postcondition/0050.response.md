Output State: The algorithm has fully explored the tree starting from the `start` node. All nodes reachable from `start` have been visited, and the variable `dist` holds the shortest distance from `start` to each node. The `visited` set contains every node that has been processed, and the `queue` is empty since no new nodes need to be processed. The `current` node will be the last node processed, and `dist` will represent the distance from `start` to this node.
