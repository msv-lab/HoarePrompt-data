Output State: **`t` is 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `r` is an empty string, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `s`. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `a`, `b`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
