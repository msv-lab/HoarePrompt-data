Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `r` is an empty string, `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s`, `t` is 2, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is a string with the character `a[x]` appended, `n` is an input integer, `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s` with the count at index `x` incremented by 1, `t` is 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is assigned the index of `i` in the list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is a string with the character `a[x]` appended twice, `n` is an input integer, `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s` with the count at index `x` incremented by 1, `t` is 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is a string with the character `a[x]` appended three times, `n` is an input integer, `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s` with the count at index `x` incremented by 1, `t` is 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element being `i`, `i` is the first element of `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
