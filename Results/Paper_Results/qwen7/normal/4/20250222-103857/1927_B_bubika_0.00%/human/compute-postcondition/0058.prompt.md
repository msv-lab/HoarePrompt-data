Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `r` will be the sum of the elements in list `a` at the indices specified by the elements in list `s`. The list `b` will contain the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The string `r` will contain the character `a[x]` appended as many times as the value of `i` appears in the list `s`. The list `b` will have each count of characters (represented by their index) incremented by one for every occurrence of that character in `s`. The variable `n` remains an input integer, `t` remains 2, and `s` is an empty list after all iterations of the loop have finished.

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the string `r` will consist of concatenated characters from the list `a`, where each character is repeated according to the frequency of the corresponding index in the list `s`. The list `b` will reflect the total count of each character's index appearing in `s`. The variables `n`, `t`, and `s` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop, with `s` being an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in list `s` have been processed, `r` is a concatenated string formed by elements from list `a` based on the indices determined by list `b`, and both `s` and `b` are now empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
