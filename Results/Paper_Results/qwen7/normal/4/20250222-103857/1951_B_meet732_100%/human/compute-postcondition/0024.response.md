Output State: **`i` is 2; `ind` is a list containing 2; `c` is increased by 1.**

The variable `c` is incremented by 1, but its initial value was not specified. Since no specific initial value for `c` was given, we can only say that `c` is increased by 1. The variables `i` and `ind` remain unchanged from their initial states.
