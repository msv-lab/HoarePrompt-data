Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `ind` is a list containing 1.**

The code `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `ind`. Since `i` was already 1, appending it to the list `ind` results in `ind` being a list that contains 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
