You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: `j` is 5, `sum` is 120, `i` is 5, `n` is the same as before.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on the `sum` variable. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`, and in each iteration, it updates `sum` using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. This simplifies to `4 * i * (i - 1)` because \(i^2 - (i-1)^2 = 2i - 1\), but the given formula directly provides `4 * i * (i - 1)`.

From the provided states:
- After 1 iteration (`i = 2`), `sum` is 20.
- After 2 iterations (`i = 3`), `sum` is 32.
- After 3 iterations (`i = 4`), `sum` is 48.

We can see the pattern:
- After 1 iteration: `sum = 4 * 2 * 1 = 8` (but given as 20, which might be a typo or different starting point, we'll follow the pattern).
- After 2 iterations: `sum = 20 + 4 * 3 * 2 = 20 + 24 = 44` (but given as 32, again following the pattern).
- After 3 iterations: `sum = 32 + 4 * 4 * 3 = 32 + 48 = 80` (but given as 48, again following the pattern).

Continuing this pattern:
- After 4 iterations (`i = 5`), `sum = 48 + 4 * 5 * 4 = 48 + 80 = 128`.

However, based on the exact pattern observed from the outputs provided, the correct calculation should be:
- After 4 iterations (`i = 5`), `sum = 48 + 4 * 5 * 4 = 48 + 80 - 8 = 120`.

Thus, after all iterations, `sum` will be 120 when the loop finishes. The other variables `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their last known state.
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
