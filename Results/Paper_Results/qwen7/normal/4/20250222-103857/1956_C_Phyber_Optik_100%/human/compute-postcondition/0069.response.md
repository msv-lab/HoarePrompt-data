Output State: `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, and `sum` is the sum calculated by the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter and is not modified within the loop. The variable `sum` accumulates the result of the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for each `i` from 2 to `n`, so it will hold the total sum after all iterations. Given that the loop runs for an `n` greater than 4, `j` will be `n + 1` and `sum` will be the cumulative sum as described.
