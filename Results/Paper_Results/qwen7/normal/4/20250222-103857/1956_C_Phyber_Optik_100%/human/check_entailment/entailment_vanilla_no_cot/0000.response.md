Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program does not align with the operations allowed and the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix. Specifically:

1. The program calculates `sum` using a formula that does not relate to the operations defined in the problem.
2. The operations printed do not follow the rules of either type 1 or type 2 operations as defined in the problem statement.
3. The program prints the same operation twice for each row, which is unnecessary and does not align with the goal of maximizing the sum through the allowed operations.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to understand how to use the allowed operations (type 1 and type 2) to fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. The current implementation does not achieve this.
