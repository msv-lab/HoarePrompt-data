Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, and `sum` is the sum calculated by the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
- In each iteration, the value of `sum` is updated using the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\).
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` up to `n` inclusive.
- The final value of `sum` is the cumulative result of applying the given formula for each `i` from 2 to `n`.
