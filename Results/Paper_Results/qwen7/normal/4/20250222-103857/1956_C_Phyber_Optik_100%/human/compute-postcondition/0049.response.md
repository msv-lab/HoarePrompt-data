Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is unchanged, meaning its initial value is irrelevant for the loop condition.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. The loop starts with `i = 2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 2`, `i` must be 2 for the loop to begin.
   - `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
