Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 but no specific value is provided, so we'll keep it as `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breakdown of the Print Statement**:
   - `1`: This is directly printed as 1.
   - `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 1, this expression simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is just `n`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1` into individual arguments for the print function. So, if `n` is, say, 5, it would print `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the number 1, followed by `n` (which is greater than 4), and then all numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the precise output can be described as follows:

Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n-1 n (where n is an integer greater than 4)**
