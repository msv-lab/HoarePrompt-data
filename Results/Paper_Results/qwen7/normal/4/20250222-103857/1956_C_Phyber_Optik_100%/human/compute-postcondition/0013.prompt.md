You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 30, `i` is 5.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on the `sum` variable. The loop updates `sum` as follows:

For each iteration \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), the loop adds \((i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i\) to `sum`.

Simplifying the expression inside the loop:
\[
(i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i = (i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1)) \times i = (2i - 1) \times i = 2i^2 - i
\]

So, the loop effectively updates `sum` as:
\[
sum = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
\]

We can verify the given states:
- After 1 iteration (`i=2`): 
  \[
  sum = 1 + (2 \cdot 2^2 - 2) = 1 + 6 = 7
  \]
  But the given state shows `sum` as 5, which seems to be a discrepancy based on the provided information. Assuming the pattern holds, we'll proceed with the given states.

- After 2 iterations (`i=3`):
  \[
  sum = 5 + (2 \cdot 3^2 - 3) = 5 + 15 = 20
  \]
  But the given state shows `sum` as 14, indicating a possible error in the problem statement. We'll continue based on the given states.

- After 3 iterations (`i=4`):
  \[
  sum = 14 + (2 \cdot 4^2 - 4) = 14 + 28 = 42
  \]
  But the given state shows `sum` as 18, again indicating a discrepancy. However, we will assume the final state after 3 iterations is correct for the purpose of this calculation.

Given the pattern and the final state after 3 iterations, if the loop runs until `i=5`, then:
\[
sum = 18 + (2 \cdot 5^2 - 5) = 18 + 45 = 63
\]

But the problem states the final `i` is 4, meaning the loop has completed its iterations up to `i=4`. Therefore, the final `sum` should be 18, and the next value of `i` would be 5, but since the loop has ended, `i` remains 4.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 30, `i` is 5.
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
