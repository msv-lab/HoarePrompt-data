Output State: **`sum` is 120, `j` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `t` is 0**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The values of `sum`, `j`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input for `n` is expected to be an integer, which is converted using the `int()` function.
