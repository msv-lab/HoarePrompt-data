Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 4

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be 2.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute again if `j < n + 1`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`j < n + 1`) still holds as long as `n` is greater than 4.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4**
