Output State: `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` starting at 1 up to `n`. Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it iterates, when `j` reaches `n`, the loop will have completed all its iterations. Therefore, after all iterations are complete, `j` will be equal to `n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations as per the given conditions.
