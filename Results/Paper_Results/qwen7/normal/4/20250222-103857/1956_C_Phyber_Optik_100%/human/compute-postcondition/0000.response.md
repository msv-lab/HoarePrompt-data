Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, and the code only updates `t` without affecting any other variables, the updated state of `t` remains within the same range. The other conditions and constraints (like the sum of `n^2` over all test cases) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
