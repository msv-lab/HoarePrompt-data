### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Operations can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1 and then modified in a loop, but the formula used does not relate to the problem's objective.
   - The program prints `sum` and `2n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations, respectively.
   - The operations printed do not maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, they print the same permutation for each row and column, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum of the matrix, we should fill the first row and the first column with the largest values, i.e., `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - The remaining operations can be used to ensure the rest of the matrix is filled with zeros, as the problem allows setting an entire row or column to a permutation.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - For an \( n \times n \) matrix, the optimal sum would be \( n^2 \).
   - We can achieve this by setting the first row and the first column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]` and then using the remaining operations to ensure the rest of the matrix is filled with zeros.

5. **Analysis of Given Program**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the sum and the operations.
   - The sum calculated using the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) is not relevant to the problem.
   - The operations printed do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It uses an incorrect approach to calculate the sum and the operations, leading to an incorrect output.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
