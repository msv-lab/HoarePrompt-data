Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `j` is 5, `sum` is 120, `i` is 5, `n` is the same as before.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on the `sum` variable. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`, and in each iteration, it updates `sum` using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. This simplifies to `4 * i * (i - 1)` because \(i^2 - (i-1)^2 = 2i - 1\), but the given formula directly provides `4 * i * (i - 1)`.

From the provided states:
- After 1 iteration (`i = 2`), `sum` is 20.
- After 2 iterations (`i = 3`), `sum` is 32.
- After 3 iterations (`i = 4`), `sum` is 48.

We can see the pattern:
- After 1 iteration: `sum = 4 * 2 * 1 = 8` (but given as 20, which might be a typo or different starting point, we'll follow the pattern).
- After 2 iterations: `sum = 20 + 4 * 3 * 2 = 20 + 24 = 44` (but given as 32, again following the pattern).
- After 3 iterations: `sum = 32 + 4 * 4 * 3 = 32 + 48 = 80` (but given as 48, again following the pattern).

Continuing this pattern:
- After 4 iterations (`i = 5`), `sum = 48 + 4 * 5 * 4 = 48 + 80 = 128`.

However, based on the exact pattern observed from the outputs provided, the correct calculation should be:
- After 4 iterations (`i = 5`), `sum = 48 + 4 * 5 * 4 = 48 + 80 - 8 = 120`.

Thus, after all iterations, `sum` will be 120 when the loop finishes. The other variables `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their last known state.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
