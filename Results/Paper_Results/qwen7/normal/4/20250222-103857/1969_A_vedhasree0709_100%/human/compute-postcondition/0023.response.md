The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The condition `if q == i + 1` is also not evaluated here since no action is taken if the condition is true or false; only the value of `i` is updated.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `q` is equal to `l[p - 1]`.**
