Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `q` is equal to `l[p - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value of `l[i]` to `p`. Given that `i` is 2, `p` is now `l[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
