Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `p` is `l[0]`
   - `q` is `i + 1`

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 1. To satisfy the condition `i <= n - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables.
   - Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `n` is such that the loop condition is met. Specifically, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `p` is `l[0]` (this does not change).
   - `q` is `i + 1`, which is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[0]`, `q` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
