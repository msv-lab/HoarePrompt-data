Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is `l[0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[i]` to `p`. Since `i` is 0, `p` is assigned the first element of the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
