Output State: **`i` is 0; `p` is `l[0]`**

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` assigns the value of the element at index `i` in list `l` to variable `p`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `p` is assigned the first element of the list `l`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `p` and the unchanged value of `i`.
