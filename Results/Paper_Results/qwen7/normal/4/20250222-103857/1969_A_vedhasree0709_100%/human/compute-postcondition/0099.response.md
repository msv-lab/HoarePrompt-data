Output State: **`i` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `q` was being updated to `l[p - 1]`. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged.
