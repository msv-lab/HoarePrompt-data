Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined within its scope. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list `p` of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct. The function returns a value based on the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, each with specific constraints on the integer `t`, integer `n`, and list `p`. It processes these inputs according to the specified rules and returns a result based on those inputs.
