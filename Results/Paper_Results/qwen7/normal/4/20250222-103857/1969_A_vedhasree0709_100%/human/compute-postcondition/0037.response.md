Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`, and since the condition `(j == 0)` is true, `j` remains 1 after the if statement executes.**
