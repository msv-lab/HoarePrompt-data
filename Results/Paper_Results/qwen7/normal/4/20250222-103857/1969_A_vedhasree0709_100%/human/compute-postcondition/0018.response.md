Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[0]`, `q` is equal to `l[p - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l` to the variable `q`. Since `p` is equal to `l[1]`, `p - 1` is equal to `l[0]`. Therefore, `q` is now equal to `l[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
