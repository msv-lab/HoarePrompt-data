Output State: **`i` is 2, `p` is `l[1]`, `q` is `l[l[0] - 1]`, `j` is either 1 or 0.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 2. The values of `p`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
