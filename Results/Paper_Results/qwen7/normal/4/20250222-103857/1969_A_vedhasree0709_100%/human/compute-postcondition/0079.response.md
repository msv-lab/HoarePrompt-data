Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[l[n-1] - 1]`, `j` remains 1 if the condition `q == i + 1` was met within the first 3 iterations, otherwise `j` is 0, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. This changes the value of `n` to an integer input from the user, but it does not affect the values of `i`, `p`, `q`, or `j`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `p`, `q`, and `j` remain as they were in the initial state, with `j` being determined by the condition `q == i + 1` within the first 3 iterations.
