Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n-1]`, `q` is `l[p - 1]`, and `q` is equal to `i + 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` until it is no longer less than or equal to `n-1`. The variable `j` remains 1 because the `break` statement was executed inside the loop, meaning the condition `q == i + 1` was met at some point during the iterations. The values of `p` and `q` are determined by the last iteration of the loop, where `p` is `l[n-1]` and `q` is `l[p - 1]`, and the condition `q == i + 1` (which is now `n`) was satisfied.
