Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

This means that the variable `l` is now assigned the value of the maximum between 1 and `b - x`. Since `x` is defined as \(\frac{|a - c|}{2}\) and the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, `b - x` will be calculated using these values. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
