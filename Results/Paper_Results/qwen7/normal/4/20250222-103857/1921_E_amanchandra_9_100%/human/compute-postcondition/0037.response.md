Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't affect the state. We only need to consider `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even).
   - `w` is the value of the first input integer.
   - `a` is the value of the second input integer.
   - `b` is the value of the third input integer.
   - `c` is the value of the fourth input integer.
   - `d` is the value of the fifth input integer.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x` is even).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.
   - All other variables (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, `l`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 2, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even), `w` is the value of the first input integer, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `c` is the value of the fourth input integer, `d` is the value of the fifth input integer, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x` is even)**.
