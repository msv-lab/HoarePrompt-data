Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into six integers and assigns them to the variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the assignment operation.
