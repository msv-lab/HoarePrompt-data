Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2.**

This means that `x` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a` and `c` (i.e., `abs(a - c)`) and then divided by 2. The values of `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and the condition that `a` is less than or equal to `c` remain unchanged.
