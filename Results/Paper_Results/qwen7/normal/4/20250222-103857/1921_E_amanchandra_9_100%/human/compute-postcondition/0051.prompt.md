Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even), `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` keep their original values, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x` is even). If `a` is greater than `c`, then no changes are made to `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even), `w` is the value of the first input integer, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `c` is the value of the fourth input integer, `d` is the value of the fifth input integer, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x` is even).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 2, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even), `w` is the value of the first input integer, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `c` is the value of the fourth input integer, `d` is the value of the fifth input integer, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and either `d - x` (if `x` is odd) or `b - x` (if `x` is even), and both `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `l` are updated to the values from the input, regardless of whether `a > c` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
