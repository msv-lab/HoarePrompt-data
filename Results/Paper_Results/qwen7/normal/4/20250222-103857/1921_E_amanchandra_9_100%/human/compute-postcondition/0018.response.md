Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, `l` keep their original values.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the conditions inside the print statement:

- The expression `[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x]` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
- If the condition is `True`, the list `['Draw']` is selected.
- If the condition is `False`, the list `['Bob']` is selected.
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the selected list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

Now, let's evaluate the condition `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`:

- `l` is defined as `max(1, b - x)`, so `l` is either `1` or `b - x` (whichever is greater).
- `r` is defined as `min(w, b + x)`.

We need to check if both `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` hold true.

Given that the exact values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact outcome. However, we can reason about the possible scenarios:

- If `l` is close to `d` and `r` is also close to `d`, the condition might be `True`.
- If `l` is far from `d` or `r` is far from `d`, the condition might be `False`.

Since the exact values are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether the condition will be `True` or `False`. Therefore, we will describe the possible outputs based on the condition.

Output: **['Draw'] or ['Bob']**
