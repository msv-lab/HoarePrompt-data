Output State: **t is 0, r is the minimum of w and either d + x (if x is odd) or b + x (if x is even), w, a, b, c, d, x, and l are updated to the values from the last input, regardless of whether a > c or not.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, and `l` will take on the values from the last input provided to the loop, as these values are updated within the loop body but do not reset between iterations.
