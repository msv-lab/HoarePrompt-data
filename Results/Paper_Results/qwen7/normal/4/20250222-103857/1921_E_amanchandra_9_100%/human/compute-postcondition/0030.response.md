Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1, `r` is the minimum of `w` and either `d + x` (if `x` is odd) or `b + x` (if `x` is even), `w` is the value of the first input integer, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `c` is the value of the fourth input integer, `d` is the value of the fifth input integer, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `l` to be the maximum of 1 and `b - x`. Since `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, and no other changes are made to the variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `l`, their values remain as described in the initial state.
