Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and is equal to the original value of `t` minus 1, `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`, `w` is the value of the first input integer, `a` is the value of the second input integer, `b` is the value of the third input integer, `c` is the value of the fourth input integer, `d` is the value of the fifth input integer, `x` is the absolute difference between `a` and `c` divided by 2, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `d - x`, `r` is updated to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the minimum of `w` and `d + x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
