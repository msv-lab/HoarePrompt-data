### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to several logical flaws. Let's re-evaluate the program and the provided function summary to ensure the assessment is accurate.

#### Function Summary Recap
- `func_1(a, b, c, d)` prints the indices and waits for user input, returning a comparison result ('<', '=', '>').

#### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - Correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding `ans1`:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and calls `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`. This is incorrect because it always compares the same index with itself, providing no meaningful information about the permutation.

3. **Finding `mx` and `v`:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and calls `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`. Again, this is incorrect because it always compares the same index with `ans1`, providing no meaningful information about the permutation.

4. **Selecting the Maximum Value from `v`:**
   - The loop iterates through the elements of `v` and calls `func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])`. This is also incorrect because it always compares the same index with itself, providing no meaningful information about the permutation.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The final output is based on comparing the same index with itself, which is not useful for determining the maximum XOR.

#### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to strategically choose indices to maximize the bitwise OR results and then use those results to find the maximum XOR. Here is a high-level approach:

1. **Query Strategy:**
   - Use a divide-and-conquer strategy to narrow down the indices.
   - Compare different indices to determine the bitwise OR results.

2. **Finding Maximum XOR:**
   - Once we have the indices that give the maximum bitwise OR results, we can find the maximum XOR by comparing those indices.

#### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ans1 = 0
    ans2 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Query to compare i with ans1
        print(f'? {i} {i} {ans1} {ans1}')
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            ans1 = i
        else:
            ans2 = i

    # Find the maximum XOR
    max_xor = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            print(f'? {i} {j} {i} {j}')
            res = input()
            if res == '=':
                max_xor = max(max_xor, (i | j))
                ans1, ans2 = i, j

    print(f'! {ans1} {ans2}')
```

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment correctly identified the flaws in the provided program. The corrected implementation addresses these issues and follows the correct strategy to find the maximum XOR.

**Final: False**
