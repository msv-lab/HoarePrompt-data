Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues:

1. **Case Sensitivity**: The output should be in lowercase (`yes`), but the program prints `Yes`.

2. **Logic Error**: The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:` does not correctly determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. 

   - The condition `n <= k` checks if Bob can repaint all parts, which is not the correct logic.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is also flawed. This condition checks if the number of parts with the same color is less than `k`, but it doesn't ensure that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

3. **Correct Logic**: To solve this problem, we need to check if the number of unique colors used by Alice is more than `k`. If `m > k`, then Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        if m > k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
