You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) (with constraints \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \)). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \) and if \( n \) minus the ceiling of \( n \) divided by \( m \) is also greater than or equal to \( k \). If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing explicitly but modifies the output stream by printing 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Conditions for "NO":**
   - The program checks two conditions to determine if the answer should be "NO":
     - If `n <= k`: This means Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
     - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the number of parts with unique colors (at least `math.ceil(n / m)` parts will have different colors) is less than `k`. If this is true, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Conditions for "Yes":**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "Yes". This implies that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Testing the Conditions:

1. **Case 1: \( n \leq k \)**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer should be "NO".
   - Example: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 6 \). Here, `n <= k` is true, so the answer should be "NO".

2. **Case 2: \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \)**
   - If the number of parts with unique colors (`math.ceil(n / m)`) is more than `k`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
   - Example: \( n = 5 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 1 \). Here, `math.ceil(n / m) = 3` and `n - 3 = 2`, which is less than `k = 1`. So the answer should be "YES".

3. **Case 3: Neither Condition is Met**
   - If neither condition is met, the answer should be "YES".
   - Example: \( n = 5 \), \( m = 2 \), \( k = 2 \). Here, `n = 5` and `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, so `n - 3 = 2` which is equal to `k`. Since neither condition is met, the answer should be "YES".

### Conclusion:

The program logic correctly implements the conditions to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
