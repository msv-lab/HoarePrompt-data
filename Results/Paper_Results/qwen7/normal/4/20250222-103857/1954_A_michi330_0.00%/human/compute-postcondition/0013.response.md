Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split; `itest` is `t`. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `itest`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `itest`.
