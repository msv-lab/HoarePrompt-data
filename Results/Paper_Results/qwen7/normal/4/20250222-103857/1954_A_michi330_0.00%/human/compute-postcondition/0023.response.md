Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) (with constraints \( 1 \leq m, k \leq n \leq 50 \)). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \) and if \( n \) minus the ceiling of \( n \) divided by \( m \) is also greater than or equal to \( k \). If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing explicitly but modifies the output stream by printing 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.**
