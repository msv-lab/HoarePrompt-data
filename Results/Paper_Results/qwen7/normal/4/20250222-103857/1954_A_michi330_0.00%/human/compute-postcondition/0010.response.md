Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split; `itest` is `t`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The variable `itest` is also unchanged and is equal to `t`.
