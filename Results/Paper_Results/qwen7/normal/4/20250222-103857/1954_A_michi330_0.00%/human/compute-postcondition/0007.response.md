Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split. If the condition (n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k) is true, then the condition holds. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`.
