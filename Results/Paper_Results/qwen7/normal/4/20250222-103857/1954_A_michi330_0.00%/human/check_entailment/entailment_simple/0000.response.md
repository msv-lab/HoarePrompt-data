### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - The program checks two conditions to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color:
     1. If `n <= k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to a single color, so the output is 'NO'.
     2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, then even if Bob repainted up to `k` parts, there would still be at least one color with more than `k` parts unrepainted, making it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color. In this case, the output is 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` ensures that there are enough parts with different colors that Bob cannot repaint all parts to a single color. This is correct because if `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts needed to ensure at least one color has more than `k` parts, then subtracting this from `n` should leave fewer than `k` parts unrepainted.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' in the required format. The case sensitivity is handled correctly as specified in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color, based on the given conditions and constraints.
