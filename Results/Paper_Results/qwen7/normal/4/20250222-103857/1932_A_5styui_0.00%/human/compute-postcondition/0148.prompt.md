Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `s` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    d = int(input())
    b = input()
    for j in range(len(b)):
        if b[j] == '@':
            s = s + 1
        elif b[j] == '*':
            if b[:]:
                break
            elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                break
    print(s)
    s = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is 0, the loop will continue to iterate as long as `b` is a non-empty string and the character at index `j` is neither '@' nor '*', after all iterations, `j` will be equal to the length of `b`, and `s` will be the count of '@' characters in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is 0, `b` is the same non-empty string as the initial state, `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@', `d` is the input integer

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is equal to the total count of '@' characters in the string `b`, `i` is incremented by the number of iterations the loop executed, `a` remains the same as the initial value, and `d` remains the same as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
