Output State: **`j` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer which is 1 more than its initial value 2.**

Explanation: The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `j` is initially 2 and `b` is a non-empty string, these variables remain unchanged. The new value of `s` is 1 more than its initial value, which was 2.
