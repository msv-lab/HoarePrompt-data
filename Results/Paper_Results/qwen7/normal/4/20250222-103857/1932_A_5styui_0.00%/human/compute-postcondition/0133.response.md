Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than the length of `b`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either `@` or `*`; otherwise, `s` is 0.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` remains the same as the initial value.
   - `d` remains the same as before.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must be less than the length of `b`.
   - Therefore, `s` will be 1 if the character at index `j + 1` (which is now `j + 2`) in `b` is either `@` or `*`; otherwise, `s` will be 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `s` will be updated based on the character at index `j + 1` in `b`.
   - `a` and `d` remain unchanged.

Given the current state:
- `s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either `@` or `*`; otherwise, `s` is 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `a` remains the same as the initial value.
- `d` remains the same as before.

For the next iteration:
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `s` will be 1 if the character at index `j + 1` (which is now `j + 2`) in `b` is either `@` or `*`; otherwise, `s` is 0.
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `a` and `d` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 2` in `b` is either `@` or `*`; otherwise, `s` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` remains the same as the initial value, and `d` remains the same as before.**
