Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the length of the string `b` using `j` as the index.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration.
   - `b` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `s` is set based on the character at index `j` in `b`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 but is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains the same as the initial value.
   - `d` remains unchanged.

4. **Check the loop termination condition**: The loop breaks if the current character `b[j]` is `'*'` or the next character `b[j + 1]` is `'*'`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is `@`; otherwise, it is 0.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `d` remains the same.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(b)`, and neither `b[j]` nor `b[j + 1]` should be `'*'`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is `@`; otherwise, it is 0.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `b` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `a` remains the same.
- `d` remains the same.

Since the loop head variables are `j` and `b`, we need to adjust these states:

State: **`s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is `@`; otherwise, `s` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is the same as before, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the same as the initial value, and `d` is the same as before**.
