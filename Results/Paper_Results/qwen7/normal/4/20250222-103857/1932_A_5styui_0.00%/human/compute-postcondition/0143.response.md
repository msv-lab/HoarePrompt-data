Postcondition: `s` is 2 if the character at index `j` in `b` is `@`; otherwise, `s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 2` in `b` is either `@` or `*`, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same as the initial value, and `d` remains the same as before.
