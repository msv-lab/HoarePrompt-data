Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `j` is 0 and `b` is a non-empty string. The loop condition checks the character at index 0 of `b` and updates `s` accordingly. If the character at index 1 of `b` is '*', the loop breaks. Otherwise, `j` remains 0 and `b` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < len(b)`.

3. **Current Iteration**: Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `len(b) > 0`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
   - `b` remains a non-empty string (since it was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration and no changes were made to it).

5. **Post-Iteration State**: After the loop increments `j` to 1, the new state will be:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `b` is still a non-empty string.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string**
