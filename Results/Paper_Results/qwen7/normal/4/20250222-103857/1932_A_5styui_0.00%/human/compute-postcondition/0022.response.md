Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `b` is a non-empty string. If the character at index 0 of `b` is '@', then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the character at index `j` of `b` remains not '*', and no change is made to `j` or `b`.
