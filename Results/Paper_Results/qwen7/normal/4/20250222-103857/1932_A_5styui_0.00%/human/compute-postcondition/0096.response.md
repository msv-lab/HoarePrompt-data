Postcondition: `s` is 2, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its current value (an index where `b[j]` equals '@'), `d` is the input integer, and if `b[j + 1]` equals '*', the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[j + 1]` does not equal '*', the function continues without any additional changes to the variables.
