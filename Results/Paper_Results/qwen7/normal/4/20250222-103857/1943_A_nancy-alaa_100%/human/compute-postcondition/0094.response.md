Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values of These Variables**:
   - From the given state, `i` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i in range(n + 1)`. For this loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n + 1`, it does not satisfy the condition `i < n + 1` (which is required for the loop to execute). Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `n + 1`.
   - `n` should remain as an input integer since it is part of the loop condition but its value is already known.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `first` remains `False` as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
   - `i` must be adjusted to a value less than `n + 1` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` must be less than `n + 1`**
