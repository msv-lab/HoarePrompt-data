Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it prints the first missing positive integer in the array \( a \). If there are no missing integers, it prints \( n + 1 \). The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.**
