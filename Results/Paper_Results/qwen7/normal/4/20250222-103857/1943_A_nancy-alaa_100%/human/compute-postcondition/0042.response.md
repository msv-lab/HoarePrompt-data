Postcondition: **`first` remains True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` becomes False. Otherwise, the values of `first`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
