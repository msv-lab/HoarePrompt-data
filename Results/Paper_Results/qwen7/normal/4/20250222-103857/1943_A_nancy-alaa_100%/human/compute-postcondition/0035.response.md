Postcondition: `first` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no change in the values of `first`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i` since the else part does not provide any additional information.
