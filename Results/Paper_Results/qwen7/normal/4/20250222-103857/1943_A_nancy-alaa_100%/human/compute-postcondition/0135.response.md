Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). It returns information based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` elements. The function processes these inputs and returns some form of output based on the provided data, though the specific output is not detailed in the given information.
