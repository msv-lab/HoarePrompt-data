Postcondition: `first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and if `mpp[i]` equals 1, the condition `first` being true does not change the overall state since `first` is already false. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
