You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
        
    #State: Output State: `first` is True, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, and the variable `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n`. The variable `first` remains `True` unless `mpp[i]` equals 1 during any iteration, which would make it `False`. Since the loop does not change `n`, `arr`, or `mpp` except for the condition checks, these variables retain their original values from the initial state. Therefore, after all iterations, `first` is `True`, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). It returns information based on the given test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
