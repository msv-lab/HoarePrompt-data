Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr', `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. Therefore, the values of `first`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
