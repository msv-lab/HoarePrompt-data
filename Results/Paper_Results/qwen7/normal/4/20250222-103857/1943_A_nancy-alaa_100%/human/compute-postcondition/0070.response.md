Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains `False`, which means it was likely initialized as `False` but hasn't been changed.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- `i` is set to `1`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly set to `1` in the initial state, the print statement will simply output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
