Output State: `first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `first` remains unchanged at False because none of the conditions inside the loop that could set it to True were met. The value of `n` remains as the input integer, `arr` remains the list of integers converted from the input, and `i` becomes `n + 1` after the last iteration of the loop. The `mpp` (Counter object) also remains unchanged as none of the operations within the loop modify its contents.
