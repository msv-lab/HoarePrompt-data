Output State: `first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`.

Explanation: After examining the provided loop and its behavior over the first three iterations, it is clear that the loop continues to increment `i` until one of two conditions is met: either `i` is not a key in `mpp` (meaning `i` is not present in the list `arr`), or `i` is present in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is True, causing the loop to break. Since the output states show that `first` remains False and `i` eventually reaches `n + 1` without breaking the loop under the given conditions, the loop will continue to run until `i` exceeds `n`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n + 1`, and no other variables will have been modified within the loop's body.
