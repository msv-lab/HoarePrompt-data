Output State: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `n` is updated to the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
