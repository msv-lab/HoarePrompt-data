Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input.
- `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 2.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The key point here is that the value of `i` is determined by starting from some initial value (which is not specified but must be less than `n + 1`) and incrementing by 2 until it either reaches `n + 1` or encounters a key in `mpp` that causes the loop to break.

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, and no specific `mpp` dictionary is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` that would cause the loop to break. However, the problem specifies that the loop will break if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, and since no such key is mentioned, we assume the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

Given that `i` starts from some value less than `n + 1` and increments by 2, the last value of `i` before it reaches `n + 1` will be `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n` if `n` is even. Since the loop breaks when `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the value of `i` that is printed will be the last valid value before breaking, which is `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n` if `n` is even.

Therefore, the output will be the last valid value of `i` before the loop breaks, which is `n - 1` if `n` is odd, or `n` if `n` is even.

Output: **n - 1 (if n is odd) or n (if n is even)**
