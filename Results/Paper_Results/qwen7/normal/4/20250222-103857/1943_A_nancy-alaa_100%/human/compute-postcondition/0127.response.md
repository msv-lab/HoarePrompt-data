Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the variables `first`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
