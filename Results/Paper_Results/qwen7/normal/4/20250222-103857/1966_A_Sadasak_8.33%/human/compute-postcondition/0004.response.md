Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

The code `frequency_table[num] = k` updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. The precondition that `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1 and its current value is greater than `k` is no longer valid since it is now set to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
