Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `num` by 1. Since `num` is used directly in the code, its specific value is not known from the initial state, but it is clear that the count for `num` in `frequency_table` is increased by 1. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
