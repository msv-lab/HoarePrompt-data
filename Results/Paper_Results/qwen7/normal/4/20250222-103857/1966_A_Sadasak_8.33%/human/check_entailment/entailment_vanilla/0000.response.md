Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This condition is straightforward; if fewer than `k` cards are available, no exchanges can be made, so the number of cards remains `n`.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also straightforward; if exactly `k` cards are available, they can be exchanged for `k - 1` cards.

3. **General Case:**
   - For the general case where `k < n`, the program calls the function `func_1` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table. If `k` is a value in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function creates a frequency table for the card numbers.
   - It ensures that no number appears more than `k` times by setting the count to `k` if it exceeds `k`.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When `k > n`, the program correctly outputs `n` because no exchanges can be made.
  - When `k == n`, the program correctly outputs `k - 1` because the cards can be exchanged for `k - 1` cards.
  - When `k < n`, the program should ensure that the minimum number of cards is calculated correctly by checking the frequency of each number and ensuring no number appears more than `k` times.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly updates the frequency table to ensure no number appears more than `k` times.
  - However, the logic in the main program to check if `k` is in the values of the frequency table is flawed. It does not account for the possibility that multiple numbers might need to be reduced to achieve the minimum number of cards.

### Correctness Check

- The program fails to handle the scenario where multiple numbers need to be reduced to achieve the minimum number of cards. For example, consider the input:
  ```
  2
  6 2
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  6 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```
  - For the first test case, the program should output `3` because we can reduce pairs to a single card, resulting in three cards.
  - For the second test case, the program should also output `3` for the same reason.

- The current implementation will incorrectly output `6` for both cases because it only checks if `k` is in the frequency values without considering the overall reduction strategy.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that can be achieved by the given operations. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
