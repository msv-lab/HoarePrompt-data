Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and processing each test case individually. It reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n`. This is because you cannot perform any exchanges since there aren't enough cards to form a group of `k`.
   - If `k == n`, the program correctly prints `k - 1`. This is because you can exchange all cards into `k - 1` cards, but you must leave at least one card.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number and ensures that no frequency exceeds `k`. This is done correctly by iterating through the list and updating the frequency table.
   - After ensuring that all frequencies are capped at `k`, the function returns the frequency table.

4. **Final Output**:
   - For cases where `k` is less than `n` and not all frequencies are exactly `k`, the program checks if any frequency is exactly `k`. If so, it prints `k - 1` (since we can exchange `k` cards to get `k - 1` new cards).
   - Otherwise, it prints `n` (since no further reduction is possible).

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly based on the problem description and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
