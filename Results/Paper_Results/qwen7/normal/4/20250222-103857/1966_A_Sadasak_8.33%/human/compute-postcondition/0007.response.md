Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `arr` must contain at least one element, and if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state changes**: Since the loop is iterating over each element in `arr`, the variable `num` will change with each iteration. However, the condition for the loop to continue depends on `arr` having at least one element remaining.

4. **Adjust the state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still have at least one element left.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `arr` still contains at least one element.

**State: **`arr` must contain at least one element**
