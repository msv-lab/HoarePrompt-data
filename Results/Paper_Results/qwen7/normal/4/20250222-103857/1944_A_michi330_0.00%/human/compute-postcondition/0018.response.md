Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not defined elsewhere, it's unclear what `i + 1` refers to. However, this expression does not affect the `print(n - 1)` statement directly.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.

The `print(n - 1)` statement will print the value of `n` minus 1. Since `n` is the first integer from the input, the output will be `n - 1`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the first integer from the input)**
