Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than just island 1. Specifically, if `k < n-1`, Everule can still visit all islands except the one that would be isolated by the bridge destructions. However, the program incorrectly prints `n - 1` in this scenario, which means it assumes Everule can only visit one island if `k < n-1`.

For example, consider the case `n = 4` and `k = 1`. In this case, destroying one bridge will isolate one island, but Everule can still visit the remaining three islands. The program incorrectly outputs `3` instead of `3` (which is correct), but it fails to handle the general case where `k < n-1` properly. Therefore, the program is not correct.
