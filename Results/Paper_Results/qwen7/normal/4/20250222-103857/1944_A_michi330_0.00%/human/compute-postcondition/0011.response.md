Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and `i` is `i + 1` if `i < t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the condition for updating `i` (`i < t - 1`) is not evaluated here, so the state of `i` is left as "updated to `i + 1` if `i < t - 1`."
