Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^3, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user.
