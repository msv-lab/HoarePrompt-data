Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, and if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then no change is made to the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, then no change is made to the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` either.
