Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2`. For each test case, it checks if `k` can be formed by choosing `k` pairs from `n` elements. If valid, it returns whether such a selection is possible; otherwise, it indicates invalid input.**
