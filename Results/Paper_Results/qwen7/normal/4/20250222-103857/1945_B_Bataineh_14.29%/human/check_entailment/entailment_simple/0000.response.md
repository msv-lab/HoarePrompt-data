Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if `m < a` or `m < b`. If true, it prints `2`, which is the correct answer based on the given conditions since the fireworks from the same installation cannot overlap in visibility if `m < a` or `m < b`.
4. If the condition `m >= max(a, b)` is met, the program calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula is derived from the principle that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that are still within their visibility period, plus one additional firework from each installation that overlaps at the exact moment they become visible.
5. The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the given logic and constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
