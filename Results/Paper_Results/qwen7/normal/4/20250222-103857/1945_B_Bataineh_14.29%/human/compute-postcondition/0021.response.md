Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`. The test case values are such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b`, `m` ≤ 10^{18}, and there are 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 test cases in total. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, the function returns a specific result for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each set of `a`, `b`, and `m` values to produce some kind of output or result, though the exact nature of the output is not specified in the given information.
