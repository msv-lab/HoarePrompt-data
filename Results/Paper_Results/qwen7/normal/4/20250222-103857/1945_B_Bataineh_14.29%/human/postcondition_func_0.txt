The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it checks if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. If true, it prints `2`; otherwise, it calculates and prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
