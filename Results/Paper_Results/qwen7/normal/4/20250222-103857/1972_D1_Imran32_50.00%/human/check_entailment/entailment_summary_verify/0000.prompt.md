You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the value of \(ans\) as the initial value of \(n\) plus the sum of \((n + i) // i^2\) for each integer \(i\) from 2 to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to \(n\). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \(ans\) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem, we need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the given program does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it calculates the number of multiples of certain values within the range up to \(n\). This approach is completely unrelated to the problem statement and will not produce the correct results for any input.

For example, consider the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- The correct pairs that satisfy the condition are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
- The program, however, counts the number of multiples of certain values, which does not match the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
