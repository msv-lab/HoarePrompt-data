Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + i) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + (n + i + 2) // (i * i)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `root` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`, `cnt` is `i * i`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to it. Given the initial state, `cnt` is `i * i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The conditions for `root` and `cnt` remain unchanged.
