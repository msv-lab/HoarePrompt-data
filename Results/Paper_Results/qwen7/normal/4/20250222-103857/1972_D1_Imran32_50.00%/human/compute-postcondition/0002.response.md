Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**.

This means that the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `ans` remains equal to `n`, and a new variable `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
