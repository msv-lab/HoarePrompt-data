You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #To break it down in natural language:
    #- The variable `ans` starts with the value of `n`.
    #- For each integer `i` starting from 2 up to the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `n`, we add \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) to `ans`.
    #- The loop continues until \(i^2\) exceeds `n`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // i^2\) for all integers `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: n + sum((n + i) // i^2 for i in range(2, int(n



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - There is a function `func_1()` defined, but it is not used in the main loop where the test cases are processed. This suggests that `func_1()` is not correctly implemented or used for the intended purpose.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - However, the function `func_1()` is called with `k` instead of `m`, which is incorrect because `k` is not defined in the input.

4. **Function `func_1()` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1()` calculates `ans` as `n`.
   - It then iterates from `2` to `root + 1` (where `root` is the square root of `n`).
   - For each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and adds `(n + i) // cnt` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Problem Requirements:**
  - We need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

- **Current Implementation:**
  - The current implementation does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
  - The function `func_1()` does not use `m` at all and only uses `n`, which is incorrect.
  - The logic inside `func_1()` does not match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
