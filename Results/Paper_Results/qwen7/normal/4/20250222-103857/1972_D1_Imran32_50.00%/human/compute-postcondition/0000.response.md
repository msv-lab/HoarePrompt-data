Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
