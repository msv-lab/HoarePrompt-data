### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided solution.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to generate a string \( s \) such that all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of \( s \).
   - The solution should be the lexicographically smallest string when multiple solutions exist.

2. **Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) and generates a string consisting of the first \( k \) characters of the alphabet, repeated \( n \) times.
   - Example: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is "abab".

3. **Analysis**:
   - The provided solution does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters are present in \( s \). For instance, for \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the string "abab" does not contain "bb" as a subsequence.
   - The solution does not construct a de Bruijn sequence, which is necessary to ensure that all subsequences of length \( n \) are present. Instead, it simply repeats the first \( k \) characters \( n \) times, which is insufficient.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a de Bruijn sequence. A de Bruijn sequence \( B(k, n) \) is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length \( n \) appears exactly once as a substring.
   - Constructing a de Bruijn sequence is more complex than simply repeating characters and requires a different algorithm, such as the recursive construction method or using a graph-based approach.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not meet the problem's requirements and is therefore incorrect. It fails to generate a string that contains all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not generate a string that satisfies the problem's requirements.
