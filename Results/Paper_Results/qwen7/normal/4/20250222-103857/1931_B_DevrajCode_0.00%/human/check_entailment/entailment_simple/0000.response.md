Reasoning:
1. The program reads the input correctly and splits it into the necessary variables.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. If the total water is divisible by `n`, the function proceeds to calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
4. The function then iterates through each container's water amount and calculates the difference between the current amount and the target amount. This difference is accumulated in the `container` variable.
5. If at any point the `container` variable becomes negative, it means it is impossible to achieve the equal distribution of water, and the function returns 'No'.
6. If the loop completes without returning 'No', the function concludes that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same and returns 'Yes'.

Given the logic and the conditions checked in the function, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
