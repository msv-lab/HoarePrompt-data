Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. The function returns 'Yes' under specific conditions and 'No' otherwise.**

This means the function checks if the given list `a` meets certain criteria (sum of elements divisible by `n` and `n` being a positive integer) and returns 'Yes' only if these conditions are met in a specific way across five cases, otherwise it returns 'No'. However, since the exact conditions for returning 'Yes' are not detailed, we can infer that there are five possible outcomes, with 'Yes' being one of them.
