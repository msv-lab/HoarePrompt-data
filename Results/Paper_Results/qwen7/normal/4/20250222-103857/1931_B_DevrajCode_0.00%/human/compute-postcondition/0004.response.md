Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, and `total_water % n == 0`; `target` is `total_water // n`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total_water // n` to the variable `target`. Since `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `total_water // n` is an integer. This value is stored in `target`, and the other variables (`total_water`, `n`, and `a`) retain their original properties.
