Output State: **`container` is 0, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, and `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is `total_water // n`**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `container` to 0. The other variables (`total_water`, `n`, `a`, and `target`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
