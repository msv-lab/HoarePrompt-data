Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the execution summary:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is done to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Parsing Data**: It then extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Total Water Calculation**: It calculates the total amount of water `total_water` by summing all elements in `a`.
   - **Target Water Amount**: It computes the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - **Container Variable**: It initializes a `container` variable to track the cumulative difference between the current sum and `n` times the target.
   - **Iterating Through Containers**: It iterates through the list `a`, updating the `container` variable by subtracting the target from each water amount.
     - If at any point the `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so it returns 'No'.
     - If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, it means it is possible to redistribute the water, so it returns 'Yes'.

Given the execution summary and the detailed explanation, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
