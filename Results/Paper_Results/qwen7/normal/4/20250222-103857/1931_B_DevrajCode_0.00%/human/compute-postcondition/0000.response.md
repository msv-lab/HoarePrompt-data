Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The initial conditions regarding `n` and `a` remain unchanged except that now `total_water` holds the sum of all elements in `a`.
