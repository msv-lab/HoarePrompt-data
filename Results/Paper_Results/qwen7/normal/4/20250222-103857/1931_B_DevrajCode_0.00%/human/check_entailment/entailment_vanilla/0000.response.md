Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Extracting Data**:
   - The first element of `data` is converted to an integer `n`, representing the number of containers.
   - The remaining elements are converted to integers and stored in the list `a`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `n` (number of containers) and `a` (list of water units).
   - It calculates the total amount of water using `total_water = sum(a)`.
   - It checks if the total water is divisible by `n` (`total_water % n != 0`). If not, it returns 'No', indicating it's impossible to equalize the water.
   - If the total water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list `a` to check if the difference between each container's water and the target can be balanced out without going negative. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes', indicating it's possible to equalize the water.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The initial check `total_water % n != 0` ensures that the total water can be evenly distributed among the containers. This is a necessary condition for the problem.

2. **Balancing Water**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target can be balanced out. If at any point the cumulative difference goes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water without violating the condition \(i < j\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the total water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'No'.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where the water can be balanced out by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
