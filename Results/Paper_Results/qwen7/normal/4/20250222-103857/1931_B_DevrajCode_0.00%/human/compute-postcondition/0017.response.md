Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, and the variable `water` takes on the value of each element in the list during each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `container` is `container + water - target`
   - `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `target` is `total_water // n`
   - `water` is the second element of `a`

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.
   - After the first iteration, `water` will be set to the second element of `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `container` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `total_water` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `target` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `water` will now be the third element of `a` (since it was the second element in the previous iteration).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `container` remains the same.
   - `total_water` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `target` remains the same.
   - `water` changes to the third element of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`container` is `container + water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `water` is the third element of `a`.**

State: **`container` is `container + water - target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `water` is the third element of `a`**
