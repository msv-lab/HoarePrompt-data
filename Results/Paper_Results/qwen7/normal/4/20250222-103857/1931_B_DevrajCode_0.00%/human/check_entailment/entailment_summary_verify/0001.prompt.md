You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. It calculates the target amount of water each element in `a` should have by dividing the total sum of `a` by `n`. Then, it iterates through the list `a`, adjusting a `container` variable which tracks the difference between the current sum and `n` times the target. If at any point the `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without the `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Extracting Data**:
   - The first element of `data` is converted to an integer `n`, representing the number of containers.
   - The remaining elements are converted to integers and stored in the list `a`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `n` (number of containers) and `a` (list of water units).
   - It calculates the total amount of water using `total_water = sum(a)`.
   - It checks if the total water is divisible by `n` (`total_water % n != 0`). If not, it returns 'No', indicating it's impossible to equalize the water.
   - If the total water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the list `a` to check if the difference between each container's water and the target can be balanced out without going negative. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes', indicating it's possible to equalize the water.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The initial check `total_water % n != 0` ensures that the total water can be evenly distributed among the containers. This is a necessary condition for the problem.

2. **Balancing Water**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target can be balanced out. If at any point the cumulative difference goes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water without violating the condition \(i < j\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the total water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'No'.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where the water can be balanced out by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
