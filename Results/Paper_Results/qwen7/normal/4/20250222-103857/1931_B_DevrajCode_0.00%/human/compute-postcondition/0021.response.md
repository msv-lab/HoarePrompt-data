Output State: `container` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `container` variable will hold the value of the total water (sum of all elements in `a`) minus `n` times the target value (which is the total water divided by `n`). The `total_water` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `n` and `target` also remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
