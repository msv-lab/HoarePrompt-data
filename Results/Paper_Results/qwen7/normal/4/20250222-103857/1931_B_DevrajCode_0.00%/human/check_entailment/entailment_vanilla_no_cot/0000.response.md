Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings, then processes the data accordingly. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Sum Calculation and Target Value**: The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'No' because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.

3. **Container Balance Check**: The program iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps track of the difference between the current total and the target amount of water per container. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's not possible to balance the containers, and the function returns 'No'.

4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the containers can be balanced, and the function returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the possibility of balancing the containers for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
