Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for water in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `water` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `container` is `water` - `target`
   - `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `target` is `total_water // n`
   - `water` is the first element of `a`
   - The value of `container` is greater than or equal to 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `a` to iterate over. Since `water` is being used as the iterator, it will take on the values of each element in `a` in sequence.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `water` will have taken on the value of the first element of `a`.
   - For the loop to continue, `water` must be set to the next element in `a`.
   - The other variables (`container`, `total_water`, `n`, `target`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `container` remains the same (it is derived from the current `water` and `target`).
   - `total_water` remains the same (it is the sum of all elements in `a`).
   - `n` remains the same (it is a constant positive integer).
   - `target` remains the same (it is `total_water // n`).
   - `water` is now the second element of `a`.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`container` is `water` - `target`, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is `total_water // n`, `water` is the second element of `a`**
