Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input**.

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The initial state's condition that the input value is an integer is now broken down into three individual integer inputs for each variable. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
