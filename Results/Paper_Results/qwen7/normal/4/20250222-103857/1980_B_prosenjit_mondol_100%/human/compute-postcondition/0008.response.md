Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `k` is `k-1`, `x` is equal to `a[f]`, and the current value of `a[k]` is greater than `x`.
