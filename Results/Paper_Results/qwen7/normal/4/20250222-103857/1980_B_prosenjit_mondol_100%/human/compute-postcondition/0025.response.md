Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input decreased by 1, `k` is the third integer input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using map and int.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
