Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer input, `f` is the second integer input decreased by 1, `k` is the third integer input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, no change occurs. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
