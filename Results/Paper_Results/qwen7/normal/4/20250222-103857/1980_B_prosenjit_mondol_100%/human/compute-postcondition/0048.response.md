Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(n\), \(f\), and \(k\) along with a list \(a\) of \(n\) integers. It then sorts the list \(a\) in descending order. Based on the values of \(a[k]\) and \(a[f]\), it prints either 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
