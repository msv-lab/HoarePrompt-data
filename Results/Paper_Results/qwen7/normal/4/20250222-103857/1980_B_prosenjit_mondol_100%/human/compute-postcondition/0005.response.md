Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `k` is `k-1`, `x` is equal to `a[f]`.**

This means that the value of `x` is set to the element in the list `a` at index `f`. All other variables retain their original conditions and values from the initial state.
