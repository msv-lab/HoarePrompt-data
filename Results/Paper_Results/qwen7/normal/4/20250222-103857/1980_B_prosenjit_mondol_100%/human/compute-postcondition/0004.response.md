Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n`, `f`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq f, k \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `k` is `k-1`.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged except that `k` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `a` being a list of `n` integers remains intact.
