Functionality: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It transforms each element in the list `a` using the formula `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and then returns the count of unique elements in the transformed list.
