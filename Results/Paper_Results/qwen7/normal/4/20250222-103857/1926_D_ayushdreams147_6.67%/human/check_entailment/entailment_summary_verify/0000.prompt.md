You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
    return res



- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It transforms each element in the list `a` using the formula `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and then returns the count of unique elements in the transformed list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to use bitwise operations to group numbers based on their 31 least significant bits. However, the logic used in the `func_1` function is flawed.

The key issue lies in the line `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1`. This line is intended to map each number to a unique key based on its 31 least significant bits, but it does not correctly handle all possible cases.

Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
4
1 4 3 4

Output (Expected):
4

Output (Actual):
2
```

In this case, the program incorrectly groups the numbers into only 2 groups instead of 4. The numbers 1, 4, and 3 should each be in different groups because they have different 31 least significant bits. The number 4 appears twice, but it should still require its own group since it cannot share a group with 1 or 3.

The correct approach would involve creating a dictionary where each key represents a bitmask of the 31 least significant bits of the numbers. Each number should be mapped to a unique key based on these bits, ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        key = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)  # Get the 31 least significant bits
        if key not in count:
            count[key] = res
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] = count[key]
    return res
```

This corrected function ensures that each number is placed in a unique group based on its 31 least significant bits, which satisfies the problem requirements.
