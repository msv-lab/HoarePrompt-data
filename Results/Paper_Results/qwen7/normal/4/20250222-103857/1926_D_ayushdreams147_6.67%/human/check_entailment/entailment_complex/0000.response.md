### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires dividing the integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - The solution uses a transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to ensure that the resulting number has different bit patterns compared to other numbers in the list.

2. **Transformation Explanation**:
   - The transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all bits of the number `num`. This ensures that if two numbers `x` and `y` have the same bit pattern in the 31 least significant bits, their transformed versions `x'` and `y'` will differ in at least one bit.
   - For example, if `x = 43` (binary `101011`), then `x' = 43 ^ (1 << 31) - 1 = 11111111111111111111111111110110` (binary `11111111111111111111111111110110`).

3. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each number in the list `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `count` to keep track of the occurrences of the transformed numbers.
   - If a number is encountered for the first time, it increments the result counter `res` and updates the count for the transformed number.
   - If a number is encountered again, it decrements the count for the transformed number.
   - Finally, the function returns the count of unique elements in the transformed list, which corresponds to the minimum number of groups needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The transformation ensures that each unique number in the original list maps to a unique transformed number, thus ensuring the minimum number of groups required.
   - The logic handles all edge cases where numbers might be zero or all numbers might be the same.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description and the provided states.
