#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be equal to the number of unique elements in the list `a` when considering the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`. The `count` dictionary will contain entries for each transformed or original number in `a`, with the counts reflecting how many times each number appeared in the list, adjusted by the transformation rule.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It transforms each element in the list `a` using the formula `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and then returns the count of unique elements in the transformed list.
