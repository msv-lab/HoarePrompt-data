Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `dic` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0; `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value `2 ** 31 - 1`, which evaluates to 2147483647. This value does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`times`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, or `ans`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and only `check` is updated with its new value.
