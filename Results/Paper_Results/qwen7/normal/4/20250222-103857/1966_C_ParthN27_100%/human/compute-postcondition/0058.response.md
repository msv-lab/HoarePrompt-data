Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `s` is a set containing all elements from the list `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have taken on all integer values from `n+1` down to `0`, inclusive, due to the decrement in the range function with each iteration. However, since the loop condition `for i in range(n)` implies that `i` starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0`, `i` will end up being `0` after the loop completes. But typically, the range function in Python does not include the stop value in the iteration, so `i` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.

The set `s` will contain all unique elements from the list `arr` because each element of `arr` is added to the set `s` exactly once per iteration of the loop.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is as described.
