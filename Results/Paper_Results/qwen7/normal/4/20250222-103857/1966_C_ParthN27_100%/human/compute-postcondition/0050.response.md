Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2; otherwise, `i` is `n` and `ans` is the result of performing the XOR operation on 1 for each iteration where `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1. If `ans` is true, then `i` is 3; otherwise, `i` is 4.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts them into a list of integers.
- The initial values of `n`, `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged as the code does not directly modify these variables.
- The only new information introduced is the list `arr`, which is populated with integers from the input.
