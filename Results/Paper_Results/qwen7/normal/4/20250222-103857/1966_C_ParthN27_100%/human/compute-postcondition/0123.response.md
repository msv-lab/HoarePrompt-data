Output State: **`i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement, but since no loop or if statement was specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables remain in their initial states.
