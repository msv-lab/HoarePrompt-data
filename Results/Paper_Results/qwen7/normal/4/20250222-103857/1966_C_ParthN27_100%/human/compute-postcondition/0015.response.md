Output State: **`n` is equal to or greater than 4; `i` is equal to `n`; `s` is a list containing `[0]` followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`; `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, or the list `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `ans` to 1.
