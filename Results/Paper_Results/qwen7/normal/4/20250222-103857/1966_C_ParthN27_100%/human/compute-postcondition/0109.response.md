Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list of all unique elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1.**

The code `ans = 1` simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state.
