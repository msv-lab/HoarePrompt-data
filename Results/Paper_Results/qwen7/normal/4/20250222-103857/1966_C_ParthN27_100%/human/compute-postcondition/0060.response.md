Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`; `s` is a list containing all elements from the list `arr`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, and upon completion, `i` increments to `n`. The set `s` contains all elements from the list `arr` because each element of `arr` is added to the set `s` in each iteration of the loop. After executing `s = list(s)`, the set `s` is converted to a list, preserving all elements from the original set `s`. Therefore, `s` becomes a list containing all elements from the list `arr`.
