Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
