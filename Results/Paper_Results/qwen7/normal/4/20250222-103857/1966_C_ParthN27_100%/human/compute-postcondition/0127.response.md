Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n - 1)`. This means the loop runs for `i` from 1 to `n-2`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - The postcondition states that if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `i` remains 2 and `ans` is `ans ^ 1`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n-2`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the next value `i` would take is 3 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - For `i` to continue to the next iteration, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue as long as `2 < n-1` or equivalently `n > 3`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - The condition `n > 3` must hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
