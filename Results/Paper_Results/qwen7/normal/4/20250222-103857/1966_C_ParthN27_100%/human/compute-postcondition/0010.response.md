Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations; `i` is equal to `n-1`; `s` contains all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` should be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is `n`), `i` will be one less than `n` (since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), and the set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr`.
