Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `s` is an empty set, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = set()` initializes `s` as an empty set. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
