Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Set Usage**: The code uses a set to store unique values from the array `arr`. However, this approach doesn't correctly handle the logic required for the game. The game's state depends on the relative differences between the sizes of the piles, not just their unique values.

2. **Sorting and Iteration**: The sorting and iteration through the set do not accurately reflect the game's rules. Specifically, the game requires removing the same number of stones `k` from each non-empty pile, where `k` is the size of the smallest non-empty pile. This logic is not implemented correctly in the provided solution.

3. **XOR Logic**: The XOR operation (`ans ^= 1`) is used to determine the winner, but it is applied incorrectly. The XOR logic should be based on the Nim-sum (bitwise XOR of all pile sizes) of the game state, not the differences between sorted unique values.

4. **Game State Analysis**: The game's outcome can be determined using the concept of Nim-game theory. Specifically, if the Nim-sum (bitwise XOR of all pile sizes) is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program based on the correct logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the Nim-sum (bitwise XOR of all pile sizes)
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile_size in arr:
            nim_sum ^= pile_size
        
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly determines the winner based on the Nim-sum of the pile sizes, which aligns with the optimal strategy for the game.
