Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1 if it was 0 before the operation and 0 if it was 1, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is being XORed with 1. This means that if `ans` was 0 before the operation, it will become 1, and if `ans` was 1 before the operation, it will become 0. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition about the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
