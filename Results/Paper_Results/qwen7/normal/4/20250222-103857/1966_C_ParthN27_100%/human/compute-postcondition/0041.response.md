Postcondition: **The value of `i` is 3, `n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by the sorted elements of `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is the result of performing XOR operation on 1 for each iteration where `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1. The condition `(ans)` is true.**
