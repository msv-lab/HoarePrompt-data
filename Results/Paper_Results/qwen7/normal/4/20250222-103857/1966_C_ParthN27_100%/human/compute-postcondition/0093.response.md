Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements from the list `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is 1, and if `n` equals 2, then `i` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` is either the same as its previous value or 0.
