Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each of `n` piles (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns the result of processing each test case based on the given conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and their constraints are outlined.
