Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 4
- `n` is greater than 1
- `ans` is either the same as its previous value or 0, depending on whether the condition `(s[4] - s[3] > 1)` was true or false

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will print the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, and `ans`.

Output: **Alice**
