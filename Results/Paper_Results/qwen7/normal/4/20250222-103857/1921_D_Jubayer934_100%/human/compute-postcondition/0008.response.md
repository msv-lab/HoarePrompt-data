Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of both lists, and `temp` is equal to `i`.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `temp`, so `temp` now holds the same value as `i`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
