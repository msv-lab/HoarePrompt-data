Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(temp, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `temp` must be less than `n - 1`. This means `i` starts from `temp` and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Update the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from `temp` and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `temp + 1`.
   - `temp` remains unchanged as it is the starting point of the range for the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range for the loop.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` starts from `temp` and increases by 1, the next value of `i` will be `temp + 1`.
   - Therefore, `temp` must still be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue.

5. **State the updated states**:
   - `temp` must still be less than `n - 1`.
   - `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, where `i` is now `temp + 1`.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`temp` must be less than `n - 1`; `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[temp + 1]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 1))]`**
