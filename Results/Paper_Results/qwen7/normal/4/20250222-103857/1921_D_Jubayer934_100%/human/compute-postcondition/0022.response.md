Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` if the absolute difference is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
