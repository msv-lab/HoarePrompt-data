Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list of the first n integers from the sorted input (converted to integers), `b` is a list of the top m integers from the sorted input (converted to integers) in descending order.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, sorts them in descending order, and takes the first `m` elements from this sorted list. The sorted and sliced list is stored in `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The `ans` list is updated to include the first `n` integers from the sorted input, while `b` contains the top `m` integers from the same sorted list.
