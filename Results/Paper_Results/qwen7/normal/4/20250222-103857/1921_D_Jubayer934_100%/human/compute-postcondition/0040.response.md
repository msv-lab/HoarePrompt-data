Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The line `temp = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `temp`. All other variables retain their previous values.
