Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list that has appended either the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` or the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, whichever is greater. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
