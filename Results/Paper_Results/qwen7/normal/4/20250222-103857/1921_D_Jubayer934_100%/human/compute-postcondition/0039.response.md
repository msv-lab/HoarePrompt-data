Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to `n-1`, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `m`, which were not specified in the initial state. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
