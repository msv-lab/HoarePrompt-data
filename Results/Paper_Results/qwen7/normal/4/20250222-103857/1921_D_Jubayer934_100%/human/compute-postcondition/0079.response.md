Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is -1, `temp` is -1, and `ans` is an empty list, `b` is now a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from the combined list of `a` and `b` in descending order.**

Explanation: The code takes user input, splits it into a list of integers, sorts them in descending order, and takes the first `m` elements. These elements are assigned to `b`. The initial values of `a`, `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged. However, `b` is updated to reflect the new sorted list of the `m` largest integers from the combined list of `a` and `b`.
