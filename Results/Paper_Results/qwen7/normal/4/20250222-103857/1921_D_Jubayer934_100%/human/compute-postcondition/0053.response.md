Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block shown in the given code snippet, the `break` statement simply indicates that the program would exit the most internal loop or conditional block it was in. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `i`, `temp`, and `ans` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
