Output State: **`ans` now contains one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[n-i]`, `i` is updated to `n-1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged except for the appended value, `temp` must still be less than or equal to `n-1`.**

This means that the list `ans` has been updated by appending the absolute difference between elements `a[i]` and `b[n-i]`. The index `i` has been updated to `n-1`, and the conditions on `n`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
