Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently `-1`.
   - `n` is a value provided by user input.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `-1` initially, we need to ensure that the loop starts with `i` being 0 (the first iteration).
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 so that the loop can execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
