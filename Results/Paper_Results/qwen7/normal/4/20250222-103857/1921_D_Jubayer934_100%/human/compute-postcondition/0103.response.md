Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the postconditions given, we know that `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - We also know that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The current value of `temp` is not -1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will start from `temp` and go up to `n-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n-1` at the start of the loop, we don't need to change `i` because it already matches the expected value within the loop.
   - We need to ensure that `temp` is less than or equal to `n-1` for the loop to start executing.
   - `n` is already known to be greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `temp` to ensure it is less than or equal to `n-1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`, `temp` must be less than or equal to `n-1`**.
