Output State: **`temp` must be less than `n - 1`; `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. However, the specific values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `n`, and `temp` are not provided, so we can only state that `ans` now includes this new value. The condition for `temp` remains unchanged.
