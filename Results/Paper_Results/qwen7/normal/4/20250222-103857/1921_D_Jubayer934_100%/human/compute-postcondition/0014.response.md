Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is `i`, `ans` is a list that has appended the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `temp`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, `temp` now holds the value of `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
