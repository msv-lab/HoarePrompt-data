Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `-1`, `ans` is an empty list, `n` and `m` are integers obtained from user input, `n` must be greater than 0, and the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of `a` and the `(n - i)`-th element of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the `i`-th element of `a` and the `i`-th element of `b`.**
