Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of the `m` largest integers from user input in descending order, `i` is `n - 1`, `temp` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended with the absolute difference of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the specific values used are `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`. Since the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` is being added to `ans`, the updated state of `ans` includes this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
