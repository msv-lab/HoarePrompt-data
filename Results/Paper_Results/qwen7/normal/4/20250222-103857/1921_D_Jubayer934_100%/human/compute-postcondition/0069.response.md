Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(temp, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `ans` is updated with the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `temp` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, the loop will continue if `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 (since it remains unchanged, it means `i` was already incremented).
   - `temp` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` will be updated with the new value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is updated with the value of `abs(a[i+1] - b[-(n - (i+1))])`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged**.
