Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is equal to `i + 2` if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `i` is equal to `i + 1`. Additionally, if the `else` part is executed, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left - 1) % MOD`. `i` is less than `N`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. The conditions for `i` and the update for `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
