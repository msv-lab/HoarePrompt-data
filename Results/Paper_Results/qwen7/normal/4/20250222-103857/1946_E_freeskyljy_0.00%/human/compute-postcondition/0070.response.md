Output State: **`nums_left` is decreased by 1, `i` is less than `N - 1`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is `i + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying the current value of `ans` by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`, and `i` remains less than `N - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nums_left -= 1` decreases the value of `nums_left` by 1. The conditions and relationships involving `i`, `R[cur]`, `cur`, `ans`, and `MOD` remain unchanged from the initial state.
