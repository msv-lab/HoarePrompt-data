Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is now `i - 1`, and `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is set to `cur - 1`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `i - 1`. The values of `nums_left` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for updating `ans` and `cur` remains the same as before the decrement.
