Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `R` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is M1 - 2, `nums_left` is N - R[0] - 1, and either `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M2` is greater than 1, all iterations of the loop have completed, with `i` equal to `N`, `nums_left` equal to `0`, and `ans` remaining as the final computed value based on the loop operations. If `M2` is not greater than 1, the conditions remain unchanged.
