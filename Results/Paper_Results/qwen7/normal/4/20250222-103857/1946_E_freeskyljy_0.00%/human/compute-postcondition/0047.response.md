Output State: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1)`, `i` is 0, and `ans` is updated to its initial value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each iteration from `L[-1] - 1` down to 1.

Explanation: The loop runs until `i` becomes 1 and then decrements `i` one more time making it 0. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, after `L[-1] - 1` iterations, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1) = 1`. The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration based on whether `i` equals `L[cur]`, but since `i` eventually reaches 1 and then 0, the final value of `ans` will be the initial value of `ans` multiplied by `nums_left` (which is 1) for each iteration, effectively remaining as the initial value of `ans` modulo `MOD`.
