Output State: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - (L[-1] - 1)`, `i` is 0, and `ans` is updated to its initial value multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each iteration until `i` becomes 0.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - L[-1] + 1 = 1`. The variable `i` will be 0 because it starts from `L[-1] - 1` and is decremented until it reaches 0. The variable `ans` will be the initial value of `ans` (which is `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`) multiplied by `nums_left` for each iteration, taken modulo `MOD`. Since `nums_left` is reduced by 1 in each iteration, and we start with `L[-1] - 1` and end with 1, `ans` will be updated `L[-1] - 1` times. Therefore, `ans` will be `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2)! % MOD`.
