Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `L`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The initial value of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` is not relevant here since they are not mentioned in the initial state and are not used in the given code snippet.
