Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`, `i` is greater than 2, `cur` is `cur - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `nums_left` and the condition on `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `nums_left` is still `L[-1] - 3` and `i` must still be greater than 3, but since `i` is only constrained to be greater than 3, after decrementing `cur`, `i` is now greater than 2.
