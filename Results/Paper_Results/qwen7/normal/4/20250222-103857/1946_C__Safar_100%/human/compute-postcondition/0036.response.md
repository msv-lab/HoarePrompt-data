Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `l` is greater than `r`.
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value before the loop terminated.

The print statement is `print(r)`. 

Given that the loop continues as long as `l <= r`, and it terminates when `l > r`, the value of `r` must be the value that caused the loop to terminate. Since `l` becomes greater than `r` right after the last iteration, `r` must be the last value assigned to `mid` just before the loop condition became false.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `r`.

Output: **r**
