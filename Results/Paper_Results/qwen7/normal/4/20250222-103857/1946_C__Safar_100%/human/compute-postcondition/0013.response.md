Output State: **`stack` is [(1, 1), (node, x)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices (must contain at least one element for key 1), `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ k < n - 1; `visited` is a set containing `1`; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1; `r` is 0, and the current node is not equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the list `stack`. Given the initial state, `stack` initially contains the tuple `(1, 1)`. After appending `(node, x)`, `stack` now contains two elements: `(1, 1)` and `(node, x)`. The values of `x`, `p`, `A`, `g`, `k`, `visited`, `d`, and `r` remain unchanged. The current node is still not equal to `p`.
