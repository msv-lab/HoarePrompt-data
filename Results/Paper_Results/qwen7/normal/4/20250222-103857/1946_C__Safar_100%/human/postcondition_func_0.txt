The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in the tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, then performs a binary search to find a specific value `r`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`.
