Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 1, `count` is equal to the number of times the characters in `s` do not match consecutively, `s` is the input string, `flag` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`, and the last comparison in the loop checks if the character at position `i` in `s` is equal to the character at position `i + 1` in `s`.
