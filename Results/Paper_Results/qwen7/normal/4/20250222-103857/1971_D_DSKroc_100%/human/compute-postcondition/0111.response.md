Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 2, `count` is equal to the number of times the digits in string `s` are not equal, `s` is an input string, `flag` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])` was true at least once, and `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2`.**
