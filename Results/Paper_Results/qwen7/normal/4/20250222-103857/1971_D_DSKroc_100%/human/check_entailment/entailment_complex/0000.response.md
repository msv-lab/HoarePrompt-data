Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
2. The provided solution iterates through the string and counts the number of changes in consecutive characters (`count`).
3. If there are no instances where a character is less than its next character (`flag` is 0), it means the string is already sorted, and we need to split it into pieces corresponding to the segments of '0's and '1's. Thus, the number of pieces required is `count + 1`.
4. If there is at least one instance where a character is less than its next character (`flag` is 1), it means the string is not sorted, and the number of pieces required is simply `count`.
5. The logic in the provided code matches the requirements of the problem. It correctly identifies when the string is sorted and calculates the number of pieces needed accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
