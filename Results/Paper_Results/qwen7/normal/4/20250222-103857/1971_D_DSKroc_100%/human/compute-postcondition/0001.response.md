State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, q is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `q` starts from 0 and increments with each iteration of the loop.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
4. The initial value of `q` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the given range and `q` is initialized to 0.
