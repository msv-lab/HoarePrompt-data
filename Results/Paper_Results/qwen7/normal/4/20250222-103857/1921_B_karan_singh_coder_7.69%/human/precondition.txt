t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line contains a string s of n characters where '1' indicates a cat in the corresponding box and '0' indicates no cat; the third line contains a string f of n characters where '1' indicates the desired presence of a cat in the corresponding box and '0' indicates no cat; it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
