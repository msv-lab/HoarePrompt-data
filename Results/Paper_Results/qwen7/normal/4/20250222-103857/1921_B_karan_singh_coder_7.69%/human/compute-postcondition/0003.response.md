Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `t = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `t`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `t` now holds the value of the input provided by the user, which is expected to be an integer.
