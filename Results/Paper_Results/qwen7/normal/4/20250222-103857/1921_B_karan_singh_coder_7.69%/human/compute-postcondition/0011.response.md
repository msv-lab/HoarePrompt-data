Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0.
   - `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string `s`.
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`i = i + 1`), the new value of `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous value.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the current state:
- `cnt` is either 0 or 1 based on the comparison between characters at index `i` in `s` and `t`.
- `t1` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
- `t` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
- `s` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `cnt` remains the same (either 0 or 1).
- `t1` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cnt` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `i + 1`**.
