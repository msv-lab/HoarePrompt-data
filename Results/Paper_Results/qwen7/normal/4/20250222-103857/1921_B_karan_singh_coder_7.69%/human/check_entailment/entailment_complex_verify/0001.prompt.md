You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second and third lines are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters representing the initial and final states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the result of the final computation based on the counts of '1's in the initial and final states (`s1` and `t1`), the total count of differing positions (`cnt`), and the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1` (`d`). Specifically, if `s1` equals `t1`, the output is `s1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise it is `0`. If `s1` does not equal `t1`, the output is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.
    #
    #This output state is determined by the final values of `cnt`, `s1`, `t1`, and `d` after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop processes each character position in the strings `s` and `t`, updating `cnt` with the count of differing positions and adjusting `cnt` and `d` based on whether `s1` equals `t1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and two binary strings of length \( n \). It calculates the number of differing positions between the initial and final states of the boxes represented by these strings. Based on the counts of '1's in both strings and the number of differing positions, the function outputs either the count of '1's in the final state or a specific computed value derived from the counts and differing positions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s` of the boxes, and the desired state `t`.

2. **Counting Cats:**
   - `s1 = s.count('1')`: Counts the number of boxes initially occupied by cats.
   - `t1 = t.count('1')`: Counts the number of boxes that should be occupied by cats in the desired state.

3. **Calculating Mismatch:**
   - `cnt = 0`
   - `for i in range(n): cnt += s[i] != t[i]`: Counts the number of positions where the initial state differs from the desired state.

4. **Determining Minimum Operations:**
   - If `s1 == t1`, it means the total number of cats remains the same. The minimum number of operations required is `cnt` if `cnt` is even, otherwise, it is `(cnt - 1) // 2 + 1`.
   - If `s1 != t1`, it means the number of cats needs to change. The difference `d = abs(s1 - t1)` represents the number of cats that need to be added or removed. The minimum number of operations is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Case When Initial and Desired Number of Cats Are Equal (`s1 == t1`):**
   - The logic checks if `cnt` (mismatch count) is even or odd.
   - If `cnt` is even, the program prints `cnt` directly.
   - If `cnt` is odd, the program prints `(cnt - 1) // 2 + 1`. This is correct because moving a cat to a different box counts as two operations (one insertion and one removal).

2. **Case When Initial and Desired Number of Cats Are Different (`s1 != t1`):**
   - The program calculates the difference `d = abs(s1 - t1)`.
   - The formula `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` correctly accounts for the necessary operations:
     - `(cnt - d) // 2` handles the movements between boxes.
     - `+ d` accounts for adding or removing cats to match the desired count.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state based on the problem constraints.
