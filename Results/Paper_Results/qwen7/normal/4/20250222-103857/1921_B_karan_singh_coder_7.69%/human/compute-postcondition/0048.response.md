Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range` function).
   - `n` is an unknown value before the loop starts.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Final state after adjustments**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial states:
- `cnt` is 0.
- `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`.
- `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`.
- `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.
- `t` is a newly input string.
- `t1` is updated to the count of '1' characters in the string `t`.

Since these variables are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
