Output State: **`cnt` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `i + 1`; `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`.**

This means that the value of `cnt` is updated based on whether the character at index `i` in `s` is different from the character at index `i` in `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
