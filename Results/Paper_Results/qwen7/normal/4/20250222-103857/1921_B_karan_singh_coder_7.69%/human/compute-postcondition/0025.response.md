Output State: **`s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `s` is updated to the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string.**

Explanation: The code `t1 = t.count('1')` updates the variable `t1` to the count of '1' characters in the string `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
