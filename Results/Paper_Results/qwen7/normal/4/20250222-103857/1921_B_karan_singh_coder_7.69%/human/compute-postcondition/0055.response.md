Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`), the variable `i` will be set to `n-1`. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` do not match.
