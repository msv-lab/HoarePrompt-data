Output State: **`t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user.**

The code `t1 = t.count('1')` counts the number of '1' characters in the string `s` and assigns this count to `t1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
