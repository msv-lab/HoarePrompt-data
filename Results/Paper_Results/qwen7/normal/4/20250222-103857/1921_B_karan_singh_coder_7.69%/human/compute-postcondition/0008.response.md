Output State: **`cnt` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `i` must be between 0 and `n-1` inclusive.**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` by checking if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`. If they are not equal, `cnt` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
