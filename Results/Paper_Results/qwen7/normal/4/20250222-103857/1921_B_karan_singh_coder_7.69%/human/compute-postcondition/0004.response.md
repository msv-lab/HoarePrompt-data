Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in `s`.**

The code `s1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `s1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
