Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `s` is updated to the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in `t`. Given the initial state where `cnt` is 0, and assuming the first characters of `s` and `t` are different (since no specific strings are provided), `cnt` will be incremented to 1. The counts of '1' characters in `s` and `t` (`s1` and `t1`) remain unchanged, as well as the strings `s` and `t`, and the index `i` remains 0.
