Output State: **`i` is 21, `x` must be greater than or equal to 0, `flag` is True, `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `flag` and retains the original conditions for `i`, `x`, and `l[l[i] - 1]`.
