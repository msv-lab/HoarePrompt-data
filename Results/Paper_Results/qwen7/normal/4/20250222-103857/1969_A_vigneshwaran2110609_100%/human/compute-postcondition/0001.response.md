Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 0 (since `range(n)` generates values from 0 to n-1).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Given the constraint `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`, this condition is inherently satisfied.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 0 and `n` is within its valid range. Since `n` is already constrained to be between 2 and 50, we don't need to explicitly state this range again.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
