Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `l` by mapping the `int` function over the input values split from a single line of space-separated integers. The original values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and the new list `l` is populated with integer values from the input.
