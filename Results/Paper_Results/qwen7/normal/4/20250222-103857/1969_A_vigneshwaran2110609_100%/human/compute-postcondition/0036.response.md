Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, x):
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 10.
   - `x` must be at least 10.
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` determines whether `flag` is set to True and the loop is broken out of.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `x`. Since `i` is currently 10, `x` must be greater than 10 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 10 to 11.
   - `x` must remain at least 11 to allow the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` will be 11.
   - `x` must be at least 11.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 11, `x` must be at least 11**
