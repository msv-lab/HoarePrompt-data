Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 9
   - `x` is greater than 9
   - `flag` remains unchanged (no specific value provided, so we assume it hasn't changed)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 9, `n` must be greater than 9 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 10.
   - `n` must remain greater than 9 for the loop to continue.

5. **State the new state**: The only variables that change or need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. The value of `x` and `flag` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 10, `x` is greater than 9, `n` must be greater than 9**
