Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd also remains valid.
