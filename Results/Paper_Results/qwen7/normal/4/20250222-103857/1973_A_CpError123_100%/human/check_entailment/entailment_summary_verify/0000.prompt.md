You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 500 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates \(x\) as half of the sum (integer division) and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). Finally, it prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing and ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of draws is flawed. Here’s a counterexample:

Consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, the scores `1, 1, 2` should be achievable with a certain number of draws. However, the program calculates the sum `(a + b + c) // 2` and compares it with `a + b`, which does not account for the possibility of draws correctly.

For the input `1 1 2`, the correct number of draws should be 2 (one draw between the first and second player, and one draw between the second and third player), but the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

To fix this, we need to consider the following:
1. The total points scored by all players should be even.
2. We need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games needed
        min_games = max(a, b, c) * 2 - (a + b + c)
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = min_games // 2
        
        print(max_draws)


func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly.
