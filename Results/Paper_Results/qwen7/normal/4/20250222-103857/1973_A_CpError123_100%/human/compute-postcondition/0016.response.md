Postcondition: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to \((a + b + c) // 2\), `y` is equal to `a + b`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and \(t = t - 1\). Since the condition `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` is always true given the precondition, the if part is always executed, and thus `x` is set to half of the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` (rounded down), `y` remains as `a + b`, and `t` is decremented by 1.**
