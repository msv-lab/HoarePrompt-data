Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`.**

Explanation: The code `y = a + b` assigns the value of `a + b` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd also remains valid.
