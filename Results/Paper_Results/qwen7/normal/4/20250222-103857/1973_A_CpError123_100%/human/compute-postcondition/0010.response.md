Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from the input.
- The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd.
- `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`.
- `y` is equal to `a + b`.

We need to determine the value of `min(x, y)`.

First, let's analyze the values of `x` and `y`:
- Since the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, one of these numbers must be odd and the other two must be even, or vice versa.
- `x = (a + b + c) // 2` will be an integer because the sum of three integers is odd, and dividing an odd number by 2 results in an integer (since it will round down).
- `y = a + b` is simply the sum of `a` and `b`.

To find `min(x, y)`, we need to compare the values of `x` and `y`:
- If `a + b + c` is odd, then `(a + b + c) // 2` will be the middle value when sorted.
- Since `y = a + b` and `x = (a + b + c) // 2`, we need to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Let's break it down into cases:
1. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are such that `a + b` is less than `(a + b + c) // 2`, then `y < x`.
2. If `a + b` is greater than `(a + b + c) // 2`, then `y > x`.
3. If `a + b` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, then `y = x`.

In all cases, since `a + b + c` is odd, one of `a`, `b`, or `c` must be odd, making `x` and `y` different in their values due to the division by 2.

Thus, the minimum of `x` and `y` will be the smaller of the two values. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, we can conclude:

Output: **min((a + b + c) // 2, a + b)**
