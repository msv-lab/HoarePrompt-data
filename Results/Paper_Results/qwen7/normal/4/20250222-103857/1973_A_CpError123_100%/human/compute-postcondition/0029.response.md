Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `t` is now `0`, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, `x` is equal to `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is equal to `a + b`.

After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be decremented until it reaches `0`. Therefore, the final value of `t` will be `0`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those provided by the last set of inputs processed within the loop, and the calculations for `x` and `y` will be based on these values.
