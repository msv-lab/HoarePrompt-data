Output State: **`left` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `right` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\) and \(\text{right} - \text{left} \geq 2\), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is \(\text{left} + 1\), `big_element` is \(\text{right} + 1\), `mid` is \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i - 1`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**

Explanation: The line `cliquess[left + i] = clique` updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. Since `i` was initially set to 1, after executing the line, `i` is incremented to 2. Therefore, `cliquess[left + 2]` is now equal to `clique`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
