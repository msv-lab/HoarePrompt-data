Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` based on the given parameters.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the value of `cliques`, `cliques` is the ceiling of `n` divided by `k`, `k` is used in calculations but its value is not defined, the array is made with values from `i * k` to `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)` for each iteration of `i` from 0 to `cliques - 1`.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the final value of `cliques`. The array `arr` will have been updated according to the loop's logic, where for each `i` from 0 to `cliques - 1`, it sets elements from index `i * k` to `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)` to `i + 1`. The exact values in the array will depend on the specific values of `n` and `k`, but it will reflect these updates.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the ceiling of n divided by k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4] (where the exact values depend on the specific values of n and k, but the pattern is as described)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, and clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The loop runs for `mid` iterations. After all iterations, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be set to `small_element + i` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. Additionally, `cliquess[left + i]` will be set to `clique` for each `i` from `0` to `mid-1`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`) remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` placed in positions starting from `left + mid - 1` and going backwards to `left`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to `clique`. All elements in `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` are set to values ranging from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will have elements from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` placed in positions starting from `left + mid` and going forwards to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.
