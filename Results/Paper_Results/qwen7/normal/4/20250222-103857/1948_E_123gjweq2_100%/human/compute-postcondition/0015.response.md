Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `not_mid` should be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` should be initialized to 0.
   - The variable `not_mid` should be a positive integer.

4. **Consider the Effects of the Loop**:
   - The loop runs for `mid` iterations, but this information is not directly relevant to the initial state adjustment.
   - After the loop completes, specific elements of `arr` and `cliquess` will be updated based on the loop variable `i`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop runs for `mid` iterations, `i` will range from 0 to `mid-1`.
   - `not_mid` must be at least `mid` for the loop to run for `mid` iterations.

Given these considerations, the initial state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect the necessary conditions for the loop to execute properly.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be at least `mid`**
