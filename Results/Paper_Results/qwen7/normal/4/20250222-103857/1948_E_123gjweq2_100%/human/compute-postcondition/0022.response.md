Output State: **`cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, and for each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`. For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`. `i` is now `not_mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i` for the current value of `i`, which is `not_mid`. Since `i` is now equal to `not_mid`, no further changes occur in the arrays. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
