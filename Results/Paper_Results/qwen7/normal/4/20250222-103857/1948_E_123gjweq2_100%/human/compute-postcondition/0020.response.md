Output State: **`cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, and for each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`. For each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `cliquess` and `arr` arrays. Specifically, it sets `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique` for all `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, and sets `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i` for the same range of `i`. The previous values of `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` and `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are updated accordingly.
