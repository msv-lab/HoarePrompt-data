Functionality: **The function `make_array` takes three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It creates an array where elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` are placed in reverse order starting from `left + mid - 1` and going backwards to `left`. The list `cliquess` has the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left` to `left + mid - 1`. Additionally, elements from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element` are placed in order starting from `left + mid` and going forwards to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The list `cliquess` also has the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`. The function modifies the global arrays `arr` and `cliquess` but does not return anything.**
