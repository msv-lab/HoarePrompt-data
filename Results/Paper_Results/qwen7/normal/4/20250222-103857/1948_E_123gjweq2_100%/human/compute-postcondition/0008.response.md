Output State: **`left` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `right` is an integer such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\) and \(\text{right} - \text{left} \geq 2\), `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is \(\text{left} + 1\), `big_element` is \(\text{right} + 1\), `mid` is \(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left}}{2}\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the array `arr` at the index `left + mid - i - 1` with the value `small_element + i`. Given that `i` was initially 0, it is now incremented to 1. The value of `small_element` is `left + 1`, so `small_element + i - 1` becomes `(left + 1) + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `left + 1`. Therefore, `arr[left + mid - 1]` is set to `left + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
