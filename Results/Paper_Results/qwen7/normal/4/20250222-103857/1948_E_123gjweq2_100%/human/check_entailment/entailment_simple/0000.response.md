Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices of a graph such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, where a clique is a subset of vertices where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The condition for adding an edge between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) is \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of cliques needed using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` to store the assigned values and the clique identifiers respectively.
   - The function `make_array` fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the specified conditions.
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique identifiers.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function correctly assigns values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the specified conditions.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(2 \le n \le 40\) and \(1 \le k \le 2n\) appropriately.
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program.

Based on the above analysis, the given program appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
