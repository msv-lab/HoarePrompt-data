Output State: **`cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `clique`, `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` is set to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, and for each `i` from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`.**

This means that the initial values of `cliquess[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` and `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` have been updated, and for each index `i` ranging from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, the value of `arr[left + mid + i]` has been set to `big_element - i`.
