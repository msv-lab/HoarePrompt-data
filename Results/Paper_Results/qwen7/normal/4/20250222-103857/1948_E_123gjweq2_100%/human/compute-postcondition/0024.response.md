Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `cliquess[left + mid - 1 : left + mid + not_mid - 1]` will be set to `[clique] * not_mid`. Similarly, `arr[left + mid - 1 : left + mid + not_mid - 1]` will be set to `[big_element - i for i in range(not_mid)]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `cliquess` will have the value `clique` assigned to each index from `left + mid - 1` to `left + mid + not_mid - 2`. The array `arr` will have elements from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1` placed in positions starting from `left + mid - 1` and going up to `left + mid + not_mid - 2`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid`) remain unchanged.
