Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?'.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`ans`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `ans`, `ans` itself does not change within the loop. However, the loop will continue as long as `ans` contains at least one element. Therefore, `ans` must still contain at least one element at the start of the next iteration.
   - **`q`**: `q` is the current element being processed in the loop. After processing `q`, the loop moves to the next element in `ans`. Therefore, `q` will be the next element in `ans`.
   - **`temp`**: `temp` is defined based on `q` and the values returned by `func_1().split()`. Since `q` changes with each iteration, `temp` will be redefined based on the new `q` value. However, the loop will continue as long as `ans` contains at least one element.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `ans` must still contain at least one element.
- `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, and `q` is the next element in `ans`**.
