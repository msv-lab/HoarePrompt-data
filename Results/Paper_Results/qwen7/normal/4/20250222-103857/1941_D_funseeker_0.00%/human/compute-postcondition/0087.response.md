Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the current `q`), `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` contains either five elements: `(q + r) % n`, the original elements from before the if-else block, and `(q + r) % n`, or it remains unchanged if the condition `c != '0' and c != '?'` is true.
