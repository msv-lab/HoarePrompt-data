Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element, which was `q`), `q` is the next element from `ans`, `temp` contains an element equal to `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is the next element from `ans`, and `temp` previously contained an element equal to `(q + r) % n` if `c` was either '0' or '?', now `temp` will contain this value plus the new addition. The precondition that `ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element, which was `q`), and `q` is the next element from `ans`, remains unchanged.
