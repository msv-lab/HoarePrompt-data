Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element from `ans`, `temp` is unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` contains an element equal to `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value of `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is the next element from `ans`, and `r` and `n` are not specified, they remain as they are. The precondition that `temp` is unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?' remains valid. Therefore, the updated state includes the addition of the calculated value to `temp`.
