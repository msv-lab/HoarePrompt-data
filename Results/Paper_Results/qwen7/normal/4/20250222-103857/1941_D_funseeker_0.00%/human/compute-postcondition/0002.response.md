Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m)`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `m` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute or not.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
