Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`). These functions are correctly implemented for reading input from standard input. Specifically, `func_1` reads a single line, `func_2` converts the read line to an integer, and `func_3` converts the read line to a list of integers. `func_4` uses these helper functions to process the input data.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - The main function reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates `m` times, reading each throw's distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on whether the throw was made clockwise (`c == '0'` or `c == '?'`) or counterclockwise (`c == '1'` or `c == '?'`).
   - After processing all throws, it adjusts the set `ans` to handle the special case where the player index might wrap around to 0 (by adding `n` to 0).
   - Prints the size of the set `ans` and the elements of `ans` in sorted order.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
   - The adjustment for wrapping around to the last player when the index reaches 0 is correctly implemented.
   - The final output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that `func_4` returns a set containing up to six unique player positions. However, the actual implementation updates the set `ans` based on the input, and there is no limit to the number of unique positions it can contain. Therefore, the function summary is slightly misleading but does not affect the correctness of the program.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem. The function summary might be a bit imprecise, but it does not impact the overall correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
