Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs of func_1() and func_3(). It processes the distance and direction for each throw and updates the player who has the ball accordingly, returning a string that contains the updated positions after all throws.**

This means the function `func_4()` does not take any direct parameters but uses the results from `func_1()` and `func_3()` to determine the movement of the ball among players over a series of throws, updating the player who has the ball after each throw and returning a string representation of these movements.
