Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000); `m` is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000); `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 <= x <= n); `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`; `n`, `m`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.

This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` have been updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged, still holding the set initialized with the player `x`.
