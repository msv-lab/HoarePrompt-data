t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four lines: the first line contains three integers n, m, x separated by spaces, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the next m lines each contain two values: an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?') indicating the direction of the throw.
