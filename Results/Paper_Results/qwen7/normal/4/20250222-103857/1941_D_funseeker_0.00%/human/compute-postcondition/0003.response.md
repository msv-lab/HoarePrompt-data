Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `r` is a string; `c` is a string**

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` calls the function `func_1()`, which presumably returns a string. This returned string is then split into two parts, assigning the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`. The initial condition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated variables `r` and `c` along with the unchanged condition on `m`.
