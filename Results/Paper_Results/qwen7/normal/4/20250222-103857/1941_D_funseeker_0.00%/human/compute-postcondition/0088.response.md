Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the current `q`), `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` contains five elements: `(q + r) % n`, the original elements from before the if-else block, and `(q + r) % n`. This is because in the if part, `temp` is updated to include an additional element `(q + r) % n`, and since there is no else part, this update remains regardless of the condition.
