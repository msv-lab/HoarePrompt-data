Output State: **`ans` is equal to `temp`, `r` is the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the string `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` is a set containing elements that are either `(q - r) % n` or `(q + r) % n` based on the conditions specified in the loop body, and `m` is now `m - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the output of `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c` respectively. `r` is assigned the first part of the split result, which is converted to an integer, and `c` is assigned the second part, which remains as a string. The other variables (`ans`, `temp`, `n`, `q`, `m`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
