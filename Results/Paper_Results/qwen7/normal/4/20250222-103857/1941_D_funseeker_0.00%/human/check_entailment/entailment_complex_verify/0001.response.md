### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly implemented for reading input from standard input. They handle the input as expected and return the necessary data types (strings, integers, and lists of integers).
   - `func_4` is the main function that processes the input and computes the final set of possible players who could have the ball.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - The function correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates `m` times, reading each throw's distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction of the throw:
     - If the direction is clockwise (`c == '0'` or `c == '?'`), it adds the new position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
     - If the direction is counterclockwise (`c == '1'` or `c == '?'`), it adds the new position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - After processing all throws, it checks if the position `0` is in the set `ans`. If so, it replaces `0` with `n` to handle the circular nature of the players.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the set `ans` and the elements of `ans` in sorted order.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
   - The adjustment for wrapping around to the last player when the index reaches 0 is correctly implemented.
   - The final output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`'?'`), considering both possible directions.
   - The function correctly handles the circular nature of the players by using modulo operation `% n`.

5. **Performance**:
   - The use of sets ensures that only unique players are stored, which is efficient for the given constraints (up to 1000 players and 1000 throws).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. The implementation handles all edge cases and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
