Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing two elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is the integer value converted from the original string `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the string `func_1().split()[1]`, `temp` is a set containing two elements, `m` is `m - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained only one element `(q + r) % n`, after adding `(q - r) % n`, `temp` now contains two elements: `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other variables remain unchanged, including the condition that `ans` must contain at least one element and `c` being either '1' or '?', and `m` is decremented by 1.
