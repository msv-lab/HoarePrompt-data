Output State: **`temp` contains an additional element `(q + r) % n`.**

This means that the set `temp` has been updated to include a new element which is the result of `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `r` are used to compute this new element, but their individual values are not specified in the initial state, so they remain as they are.
