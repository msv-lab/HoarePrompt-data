Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**: The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) that are used to read input and process it. These functions seem to be correctly implemented for reading input from standard input.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates `m` times, reading each throw's distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on whether the throw was made clockwise (`c == '0'` or `c == '?'`) or counterclockwise (`c == '1'` or `c == '?'`).
   - After processing all throws, it adjusts the set `ans` to handle the special case where the player index might wrap around to 0 (by adding `n` to 0).
   - Prints the size of the set `ans` and the elements of `ans` in sorted order.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for updating the set `ans` correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
   - The adjustment for wrapping around to the last player when the index reaches 0 is correctly implemented.
   - The final output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
