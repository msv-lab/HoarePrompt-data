Output State: **`x` is 1, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `x` remains unchanged at 1, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as they are integers entered by the user. The variable `y` is decreased by 1, but its initial value is not specified, so we only know that `y` is now 1 less than its original value.
