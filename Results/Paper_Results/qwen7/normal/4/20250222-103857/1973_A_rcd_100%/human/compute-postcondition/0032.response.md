Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 1, `x` is increased by 1, `y` must be greater than or equal to 1**.

In this case, the variable `x` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
