Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, and `y` is `p2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so `y` is now `p2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
