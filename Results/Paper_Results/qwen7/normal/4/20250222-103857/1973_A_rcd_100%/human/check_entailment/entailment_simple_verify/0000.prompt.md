You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last set of values entered by the user for which the loop did not encounter an odd sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and the condition `p3 < p1 + p2` was satisfied. If the loop terminated normally without any odd sums or if all possible inputs led to printing `p3`, then `x` will be 0 and `y` will be equal to `p3`. If the loop terminated due to an odd sum, `x` and `y` will not be updated and their values will depend on the last iteration where the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was checked.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2`

According to the problem description, if the scores are `1 1 2`, the maximum number of draws would be `2`. This is because the only way to achieve these scores is through two draws (one between the first and second player, and one between the first and third player), resulting in each player having 1 point from the draws and 0 points from any possible losses.

However, the program does not handle this case correctly. Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1. The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. For the input `1 1 2`, this condition is false.
2. Next, it checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. For `1 1 2`, this condition is true, and it prints `p1 + p2`, which is `2`.

While the program correctly identifies that the scores are consistent, it does not account for the possibility of multiple draws. Specifically, it assumes that the difference between `p3` and `p1 + p2` can be achieved solely through wins and losses, without considering the possibility of additional draws.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly calculate the maximum number of draws. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (total_points - 2 * p3) // 2
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly, handling all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
