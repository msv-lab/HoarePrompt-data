You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last set of values entered by the user for which the loop did not encounter an odd sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and the condition `p3 < p1 + p2` was satisfied. If the loop terminated normally without any odd sums or if all possible inputs led to printing `p3`, then `x` will be 0 and `y` will be equal to `p3`. If the loop terminated due to an odd sum, `x` and `y` will not be updated and their values will depend on the last iteration where the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was checked.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This condition ensures that the highest score (`p3`) is at least the sum of the other two scores, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be feasible given the rules of the game.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above condition is false, the program enters a loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws. 
     - It initializes `x` and `y` such that `x` represents the number of draws involving the first player and `y` represents the number of draws involving the second player.
     - The loop continues until `y >= x`.
     - Inside the loop, it checks if the remaining points for the first player (`p1 - x`) are less than or equal to the remaining points for the second player (`p2 - y`). If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it increments `x` and decrements `y`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Even Total Points Check:**
   - This check is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.

2. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It ensures that the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, which is a basic requirement for the scores to be feasible. However, it does not guarantee that the scores can be achieved through a valid sequence of games.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws seems flawed. The approach assumes that the remaining points for the first player should be less than or equal to the remaining points for the second player, which is not always correct. For example, consider the case `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`. The correct maximum number of draws is 1, but the program would incorrectly calculate it as 0.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the input:
```
1
1 1 2
```

- The total points are `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`, which is even.
- `p3 = 2` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2 = 2`.
- The program enters the loop and calculates the maximum number of draws.
- It sets `x = 0` and `y = 2`.
- The loop runs and finds that `p1 - 0 = 1` is not less than or equal to `p2 - 2 = -1`, so it increments `x` and decrements `y`.
- The loop continues until `y < x`, and it prints `p3 = 2`.

However, the correct maximum number of draws is 1, as one draw between the first and second player and one win for the third player would achieve the scores.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
