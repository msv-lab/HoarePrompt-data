Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Additionally, after all iterations of the loop, `x` will be either 0 or 1, and `y` will be equal to `p3`. The loop will continue until either the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, in which case it will print `p1 - x + p3` and break, or until `y` becomes less than `x`, in which case it will print `p3`. If the condition is never met, `p3` will be printed after all iterations.
