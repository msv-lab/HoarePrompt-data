Output State: **`x` is either 0 or 1, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `x` and `y`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the conditions and values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
