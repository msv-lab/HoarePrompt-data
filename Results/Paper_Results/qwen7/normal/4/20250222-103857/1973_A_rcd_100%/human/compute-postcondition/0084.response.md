Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `y >= x`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`, where `p3` is an integer entered by the user.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `y >= x` must be true.
   - Since `x` is 0, the condition simplifies to `y >= 0`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `y`.
   - `y` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Consider the initial state of `y`**:
   - `y` is equal to `p3`, and `p3` is an integer entered by the user.
   - Therefore, `y` could be any integer, including negative values.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `y` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 0.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure `y` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 0, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0**
