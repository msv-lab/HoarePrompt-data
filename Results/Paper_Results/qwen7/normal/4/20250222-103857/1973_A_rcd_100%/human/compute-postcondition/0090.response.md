Output State: **`x` is 1, `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, `y` is `y - 1`.**

The value of `y` is decremented by 1, making it `y - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `(p1 - x > p2 - y)` remains valid since `x` and `p2` are unchanged, and `y` is only decreased by 1.
