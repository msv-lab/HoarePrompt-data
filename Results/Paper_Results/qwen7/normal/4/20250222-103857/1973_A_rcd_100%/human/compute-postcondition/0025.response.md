Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is either 0 or 2, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 1 if `x` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1. Since `x` was either 0 or 1, after incrementing, `x` becomes either 1 or 2. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
