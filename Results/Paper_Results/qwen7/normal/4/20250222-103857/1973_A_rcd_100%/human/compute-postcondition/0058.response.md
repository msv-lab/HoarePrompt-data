Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

The expression to be evaluated in the `print` statement is `p1 - x + p3`.

Since `x` can only be 0 or 1, and `y` is not directly used in the expression, we need to consider the values of `p1` and `p3`. However, `p1` and `p3` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we will represent them as `p1` and `p3` in the output.

Given this, the output will depend on the value of `x`:

- If `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3`.
- If `x` is 1, the expression becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Since we don't have explicit values for `p1` and `p3`, we will represent them as they are.

Output: **p1 - x + p3**
