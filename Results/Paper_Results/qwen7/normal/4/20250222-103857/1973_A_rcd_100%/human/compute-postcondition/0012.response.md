Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `y >= x`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.

3. **Determine the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is equal to `p3`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `x` is 0, the loop will execute if `y` (which is `p3`) is greater than or equal to 0. However, since `p3` is an integer entered by the user and we know from the problem statement that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `p3` will always be a non-negative integer (assuming `p1` and `p2` are positive integers).

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `y` (which is `p3`) is greater than or equal to `x` (which is 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 0, `y` is equal to `p3` and `y` must be greater than or equal to 0**
