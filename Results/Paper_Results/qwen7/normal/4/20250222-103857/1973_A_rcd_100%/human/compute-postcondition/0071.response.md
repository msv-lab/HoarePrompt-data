Output State: **`x` is either 0 or 1, `y` is 1 if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, otherwise `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.**

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `x` will either remain 0 or become 1. The value of `y` will be 1 if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` evaluates to true, otherwise it will be 0. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will remain as they were initially because none of these variables are modified within the loop.
