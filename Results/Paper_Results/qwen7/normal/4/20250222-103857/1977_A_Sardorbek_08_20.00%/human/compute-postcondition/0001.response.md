State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `a`, and implicitly the range function which uses `a` as its argument.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `0 <= i < a` must be true at the start of the loop.
3. Initially, `i` is set to 0.
4. The variable `a` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
5. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `a` must be a positive integer and it should be within the range where the loop can run at least once.

Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions:
- `t` is given as a positive integer between 1 and 100, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly.
- `a` must be a positive integer (since `t` is already constrained to be a positive integer).
- `i` is initialized to 0.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0**
