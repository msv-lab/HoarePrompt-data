You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a`, `b` is an integer obtained from the last input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second last input split, `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`). The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged regardless of the conditions within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it means Nikita can simply add one cube per move to get exactly `c` cubes.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of removing cubes. For example, if `b = 2` and `c = 4`, it should be possible to add 2 cubes and remove none, but the current logic would incorrectly print 'NO'.
   - The condition `if a % 2 == b % 2:` is irrelevant here since `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves. This part of the code should be removed.
   - The default case (`else`) prints 'No', which is also incorrect for the same reason as the previous condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the number of moves `b` is at least equal to the desired number of cubes `c`. Additionally, the parity (odd/even nature) of `b` and `c` must match because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions. Based on the analysis, the revised program is correct.
