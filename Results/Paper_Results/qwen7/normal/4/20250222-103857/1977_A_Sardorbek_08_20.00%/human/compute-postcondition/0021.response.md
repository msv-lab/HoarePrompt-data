Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and `b` is not equal to `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2` if `a % 2` is different from `b % 2`; otherwise, no changes are made to `a % 2`.
