Output: **No**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, the variables and their values are as follows:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
- `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split.
- `q` is a tuple containing (`b`, `c`).

The `print('No')` statement directly prints the string `'No'`. There are no conditions or calculations involved in this print statement, so it simply outputs the string as is.
