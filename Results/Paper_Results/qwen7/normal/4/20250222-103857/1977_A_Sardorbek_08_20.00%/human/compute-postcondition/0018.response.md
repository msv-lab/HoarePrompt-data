Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `a` modulo 2 is equal to `b` modulo 2, then no changes are made. Otherwise, `a` modulo 2 is not equal to `b` modulo 2.
