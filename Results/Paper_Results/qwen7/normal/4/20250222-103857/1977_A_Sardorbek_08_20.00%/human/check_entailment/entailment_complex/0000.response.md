Reasoning:

1. The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`, which is correct.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a for loop where `i` ranges from `0` to `a-1`. This means `i` will take the values from `0` to `a-1`, inclusive.
3. Inside the loop, it reads two integers `b` and `c` for each test case.
4. The tuple `q` is assigned the values of `b` and `c`, which is unnecessary and does not affect the logic.
5. The conditions for printing the results are:
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `a % 2 == b % 2`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The issue lies in the condition `if a % 2 == b % 2:`. Here, `a` is the number of test cases, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements. Instead, we should check if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd).

The correct logic should be:
- If `b == c`, print 'YES'.
- If `b < c`, print 'NO'.
- If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), print 'YES'.
- Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required for the problem. Therefore, the function needs to be corrected.

Correctness: **False**
