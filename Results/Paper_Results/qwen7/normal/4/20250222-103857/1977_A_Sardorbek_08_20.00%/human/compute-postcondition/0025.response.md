Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `b` and the second integer to `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
