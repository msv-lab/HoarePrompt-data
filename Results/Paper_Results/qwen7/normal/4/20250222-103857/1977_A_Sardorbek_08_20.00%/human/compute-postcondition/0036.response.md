Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `c` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `b` and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts those parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `b` and `c`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `q`) remain unchanged.
