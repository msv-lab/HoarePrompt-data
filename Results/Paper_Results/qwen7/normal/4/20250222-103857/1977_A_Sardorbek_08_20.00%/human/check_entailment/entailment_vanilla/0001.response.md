Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` where `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to achieve `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it means Nikita can simply add one cube per move to get exactly `c` cubes.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of removing cubes. For example, if `b = 2` and `c = 4`, it should be possible to add 2 cubes and remove none, but the current logic would incorrectly print 'NO'.
   - The condition `if a % 2 == b % 2:` is irrelevant here since `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves. This part of the code should be removed.
   - The default case (`else`) prints 'No', which is also incorrect for the same reason as the previous condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the number of moves `b` is at least equal to the desired number of cubes `c`. Additionally, the parity (odd/even nature) of `b` and `c` must match because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions. Based on the analysis, the revised program is correct.

**Correctness: False**
