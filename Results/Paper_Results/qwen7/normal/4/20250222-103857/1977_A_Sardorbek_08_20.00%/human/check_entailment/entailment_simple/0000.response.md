### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and processes each test case.
   - It correctly splits the input for each test case into `b` and `c`.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - The condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves `b` equals the desired number of cubes `c`. If true, it prints "YES".
   - The condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`. If true, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves `b` matches the parity of the desired number of cubes `c`. If true, it prints "Yes". This condition is incorrect because it should check if `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2`.
   - The default condition `else:` prints "No" if none of the above conditions are met.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `a` times, processing each test case correctly.

### Correctness:
- The logic for checking if `b == c` and `b < c` is correct.
- The logic for checking the parity of `b` and `c` is incorrect. It should be `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2`.

Given this analysis, the program is almost correct but has a small logical error in the parity check condition.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
