Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `input integer - 2`, `sp` is the value of `a[2]`, `bp` is unchanged, `bm` is unchanged, `sm` is unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `sp = a[s]` assigns the value of `a[2]` to `sp`. The value of `s` is 2, so `sp` is now the value of `a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
