Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is -2, `sp` is the element at index `s` in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[s]` to the variable `sp`. Since `s` is not defined in the given code snippet, it remains undefined. The values of `t`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is -2, and `sp` is the element at index `s` in list `a`.
