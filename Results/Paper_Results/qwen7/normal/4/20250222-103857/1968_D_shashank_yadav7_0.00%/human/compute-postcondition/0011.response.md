Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently `-2`.
   - `n` is not explicitly stated in the given state, but it is used in the loop condition.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will start if `i < n` is true.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is `-2`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `-2` for the loop to start. However, since `n` is the upper bound of the range, it should be a non-negative integer.
   - We also need to set `i` to the starting value of the loop, which is `0` (the default starting value for `range(n)`).

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to `0` and `n` is a positive integer greater than `0`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 (this variable is not directly related to the loop and does not need to be adjusted).
- `i` is `0`.
- `n` must be a positive integer greater than `0`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0**.
