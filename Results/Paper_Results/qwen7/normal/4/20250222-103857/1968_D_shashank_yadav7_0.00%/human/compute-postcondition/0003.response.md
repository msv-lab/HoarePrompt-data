Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
