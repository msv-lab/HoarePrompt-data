Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp`**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by subtracting 1 from `p[s]`. Since `s` was previously defined as `p[s] - 1 - 1`, after this operation, `s` becomes `p[s] - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
