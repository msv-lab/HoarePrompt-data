Output State: **`sm` is `sm` + max(`sm`, `a[s]` * `k` + `sp`), `i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` equals 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`**.

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. The other variables (`sm`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
