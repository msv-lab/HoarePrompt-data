Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 4, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bm` by adding to it the maximum of `bm` and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. However, since `a`, `bp`, and `p` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot simplify the expression further. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
