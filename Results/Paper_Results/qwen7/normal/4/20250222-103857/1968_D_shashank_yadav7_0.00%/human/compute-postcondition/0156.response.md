Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to it. Since `k` is -2, `a[s] * k` will be `-2 * a[s]`. The value of `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, which simplifies to `2 * a[s] + sp`. Therefore, `a[s] * k + sp` becomes `-2 * a[s] + 2 * a[s] + sp`, which simplifies to `sp`. Thus, `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is equivalent to `max(sm, sp)`. The exact value of `sm` depends on its initial value and the current value of `sp`, but it is updated to `sm + max(sm, sp)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
