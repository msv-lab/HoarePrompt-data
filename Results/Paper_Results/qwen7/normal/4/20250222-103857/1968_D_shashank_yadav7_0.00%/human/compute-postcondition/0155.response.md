Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the code.
- The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the code.
- The value of `bm` is updated by adding `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` to it. Given that `bm` was initially `2 * bm`, the new value of `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- The value of `sm` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
- The value of `sp` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
- The value of `bp` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
