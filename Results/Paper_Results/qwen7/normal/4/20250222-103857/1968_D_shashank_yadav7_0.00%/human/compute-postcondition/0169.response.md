Output: **Draw**

Explanation:
- The initial state provides the values for `i`, `k`, and the relationships between other variables like `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp`.
- The print statement `print('Draw')` simply outputs the string 'Draw'.
- Since the print statement does not depend on the values of any variables but rather directly prints a string, the output remains constant regardless of the values of `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, etc.
- Therefore, the output is simply the string 'Draw'.
