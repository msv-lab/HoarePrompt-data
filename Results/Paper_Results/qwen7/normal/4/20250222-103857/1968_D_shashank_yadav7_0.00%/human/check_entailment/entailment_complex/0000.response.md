Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input values for each test case.
2. It initializes the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha by decrementing their indices by 1 since list indices start at 0.
3. It calculates the initial scores for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions.
4. The function then iterates through the permutation `p` up to `k` times, updating the scores for both players. During each iteration, it updates the positions of both players to their respective `p[x]` positions and adds the corresponding scores.
5. The final scores `bm` and `sm` are compared to determine the winner.
6. The overall logic of the function matches the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
