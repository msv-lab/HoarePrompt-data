Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is -3, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `s - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sm` is `a[s] * k`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `sm = a[s] * k` assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to `sm`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `n`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `sm` is now determined by the value of `a[s]` and `k`.
