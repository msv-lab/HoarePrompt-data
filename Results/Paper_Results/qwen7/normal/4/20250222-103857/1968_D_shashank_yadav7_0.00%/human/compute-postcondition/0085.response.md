Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by calculating `p[s] - 1`. However, since the exact values of `p[s]` are not specified, we cannot simplify further. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
