Output State: All variables outside the loop will retain their final values from the last iteration, which are as follows:

- `i` is 2
- `bp` is `bp` + `a[b] * 2` + `a[b]`
- `bm` is `max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp) + max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp)`
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0
- `k` is -2
- `s` is `p[s] - 2`
- `sp` is increased by `a[s]` three times
- `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`

The loop has completed all its iterations, and the values of `i`, `bp`, `bm`, `k`, `s`, and `sp` reflect the changes made during the last iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was set at the start of the loop and was not modified within the loop body. The value of `sm` is updated twice with the maximum value between itself and the calculated expression `a[s] * k + sp`.
