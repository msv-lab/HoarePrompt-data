Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp) + max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp)`, `i` is 2, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b] * 2` + `a[b]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` three times, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**

Explanation:
- The line `bp += a[b]` adds the value of `a[b]` to `bp`.
- The initial state of `bp` was `bp` + `a[b] * 2`, so after adding `a[b]` again, `bp` becomes `bp` + `a[b] * 2` + `a[b]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
