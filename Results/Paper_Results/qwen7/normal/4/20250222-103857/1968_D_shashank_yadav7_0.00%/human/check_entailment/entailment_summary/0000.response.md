Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: \(n\), \(k\), \(P_B\), \(P_S\), the permutation \(p\), and the array \(a\).
3. It adjusts the starting positions \(P_B\) and \(P_S\) to be zero-indexed.
4. It initializes the scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`).
5. The program then iterates up to \(k\) times, updating the positions and scores based on the rules of the game. Specifically, it updates the scores considering the maximum possible score for each player at each step.
6. Finally, it compares the final scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the rules of the game and calculate the scores accurately. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
