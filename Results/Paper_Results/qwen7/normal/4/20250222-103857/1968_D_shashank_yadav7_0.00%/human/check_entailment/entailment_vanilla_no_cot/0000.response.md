Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a brief breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha), and then the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
3. **Adjusting Starting Positions**: It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
4. **Initial Scores Calculation**: It initializes the scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) based on their initial positions.
5. **Game Simulation**: It simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores of both players. For each turn, it updates the scores considering the maximum possible score for each player based on their current and potential future positions.
6. **Result Determination**: After simulating the game, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

The logic in the program accurately reflects the rules of the game as described in the problem statement, and it handles all the necessary calculations and comparisons correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
