Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `3`, `n` must be greater than `3`, `v2` is `3`, `v1` is `3`, `g` is `0`, `r` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` (which is `3`) to `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v1` is updated to `3`, while the other variables retain their original values.
