Output State: **`prev` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 1, `r2` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r2 = input('')` assigns the value of the string input by the user to the variable `r2`. The other variables (`prev`, `i`, `n`, and `v2`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
