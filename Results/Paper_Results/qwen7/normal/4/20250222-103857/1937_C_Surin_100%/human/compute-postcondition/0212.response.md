Output State: **`i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is an input string and r is not equal to '>', and the current value of `r` is '='.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified by this operation, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
