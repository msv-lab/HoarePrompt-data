Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `v2` is 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `v2`. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values, their states remain unchanged.
