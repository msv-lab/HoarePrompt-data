Output State: **`r` is the new input string, `prev` is an input integer if `r` was '>', `r2` is the input string from the user if `r` was '=', and the states of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously written output is actually sent to the terminal. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified, their states remain as they were before executing this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `r` is now the new input string, while the conditions for setting `prev` and `r2` remain the same.
