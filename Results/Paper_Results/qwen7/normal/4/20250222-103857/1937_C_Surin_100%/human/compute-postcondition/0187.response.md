Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise the value of `v1` remains unchanged, `r` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user. The values of `i`, `v2`, and `v1` remain unchanged unless the user inputs a specific character ('<') which would then determine the value of `v1`. Since the user's input is not specified, `v1` retains its initial value of 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise, it remains unchanged.
