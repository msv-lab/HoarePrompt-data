Output State: **`r` is an input string, if `r` equals '>', then `prev` is an input integer, if `r` equals '=', then `r2` is the input string from the user, and if `r2` equals '<', then `prev` is set to `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, `n` must be greater than `i+1`, and `r` is now the new input string; `prev` is now equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Since the initial conditions for `i` are not specified, `prev` is simply set to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
