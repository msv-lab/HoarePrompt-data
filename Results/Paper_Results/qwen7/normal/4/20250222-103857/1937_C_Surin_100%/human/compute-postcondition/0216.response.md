Output State: **`i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 1, `r` is an input string and r is not equal to '>', the current value of `r2` is '<'**.

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
