Output State: **`prev` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is 1, `r` is the input string from the user**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending buffered data is written to the terminal. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `prev`, `i`, `n`, `v2`, and `r` remain unchanged.
