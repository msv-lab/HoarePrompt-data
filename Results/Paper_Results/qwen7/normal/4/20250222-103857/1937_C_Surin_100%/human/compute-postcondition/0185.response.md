Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `v2` is 2.
   - If `r` is equal to '<', then `v1` is 1. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `v1`:**
   - Since the value of `r` is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both possible conditions:
     - If `r == '<'`, then `v1` is 1.
     - If `r != '<'`, then `v1` retains its default value, which is not explicitly given but can be inferred from the context. Given no other information, we assume it remains undefined or unchanged, which typically means it retains its previous value if not reassigned. Since `v1` is not initialized elsewhere in the provided information, we assume it is also 1 unless otherwise stated.

Given the lack of specific information about `r`, we assume the simplest case where `v1` is 1.

4. **Determine the Values to Print:**
   - `v1` is 1.
   - `v2` is 2.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output: `? 1 1 2 2`.

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
