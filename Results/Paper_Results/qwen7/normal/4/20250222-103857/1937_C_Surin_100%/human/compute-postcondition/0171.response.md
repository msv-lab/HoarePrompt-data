Output State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`r`, `prev`, `i`, `v2`, `v1`, `g`, `kp`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `n` is an integer obtained from user input.
