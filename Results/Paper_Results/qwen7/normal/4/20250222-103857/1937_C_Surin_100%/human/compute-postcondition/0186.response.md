Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 1 if `r` is '<', otherwise the value of `v1` remains unchanged.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `v2`, or `v1`. It only flushes the output buffer, which is an operation related to the console or file handling and does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i` and `v2` remain the same, and `v1` retains its value based on the condition that if `r` is `<`, then `v1` is 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
