Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is an input string.
- `prev` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `n` is greater than `n-1`, so `n` must be at least 2.
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `g` is 0.

The `print(f'! {prev} {v1}')` statement will print the values of `prev` and `v1`.

From the initial state, both `prev` and `v1` are equal to `n-1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n-1` is at least 1.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **! 1 1**
