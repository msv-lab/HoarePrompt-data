Output State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 3, `r` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 3) to `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` now holds the value 3, while the other variables retain their initial states.
