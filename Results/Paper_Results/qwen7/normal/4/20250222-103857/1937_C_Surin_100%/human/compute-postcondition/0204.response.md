Output State: **`i` is 1, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `r` is an input string**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. Since the initial values of `i`, `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` are not affected by this line of code, they remain the same. The value of `r` is now a string containing the user's input.
