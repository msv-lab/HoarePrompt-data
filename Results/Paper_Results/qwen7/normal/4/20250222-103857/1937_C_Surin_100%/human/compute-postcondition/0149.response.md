Output State: **`prev` is `i`, `r` is the new input string, `r2` is the new input string from the user if `r` was '=', and the states of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. The values of `r`, `r2`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
