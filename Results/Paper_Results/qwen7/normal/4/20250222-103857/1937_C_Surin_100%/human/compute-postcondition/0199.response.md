Output State: **i is n, v2 is n-1, and v1 is n-1.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `v2` will be one less than `n` (i.e., `n-1`). The variable `v1` will also be `n-1`. This is because in each iteration of the loop, `v2` is updated to the current value of `i`, and `v1` is updated to `v2` only if the input `r` is '<'. Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, by the last iteration, `i` becomes `n`, `v2` becomes `n-1`, and `v1` remains `n-1` unless `r` was not '<' in any of the iterations, but the problem statement guarantees that `v1` will be `n-1` at the end.
