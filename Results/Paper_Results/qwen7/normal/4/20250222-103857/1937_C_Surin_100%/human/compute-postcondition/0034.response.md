Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is defined as `n-1`, where `n` must be at least 2.
- `v2` is defined as `n-1`, but `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it's not clear what `v1` is. Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. However, we know the following:
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.

Therefore, the output will include `v1` (whose value is unknown), `i` (which is `n-1`), another `v1` (again, whose value is unknown), and `prev` (which is 0).

Output: **? [v1] [n-1] [v1] 0**
