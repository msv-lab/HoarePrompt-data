Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which must be an integer greater than `n-1`) to the variable `n`. The values of `prev`, `i`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
