Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string from the user**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all buffered data is written to the standard output immediately. However, this operation does not affect any variable values or conditions. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
