Output State: **`r` is an input string, `prev` is `i`, `i` is `i+1`, and `n` is greater than `i+1` if `prev` was `i+1`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = i` updates the value of `prev` to be equal to the current value of `i`. The other variables (`r`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition regarding `n` being greater than `i+1` if `prev` was `i+1` remains valid as `prev` is now `i`, which implies the previous value of `prev` was indeed `i+1`.
