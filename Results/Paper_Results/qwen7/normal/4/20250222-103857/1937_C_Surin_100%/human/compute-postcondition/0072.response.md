Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is `1`
- `i` is `2`
- `v1` is not explicitly defined, but it seems to be a placeholder for a variable or value that should be printed. Given the context, it's likely that `v1` is meant to be `prev` since there's no other definition for `v1`.
- `v2` is `1`
- `r` is the input string from the user, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Given the values:
- `v1` is `prev`, which is `1`
- `i` is `2`
- `prev` is `1`

Substituting these values into the print statement:
```python
print(f'? 1 2 1 1')
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 2 1 1**
