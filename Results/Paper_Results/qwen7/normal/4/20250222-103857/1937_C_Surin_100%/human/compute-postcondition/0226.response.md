Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `prev` is either 0 or 1, `r` is an input string from the user, the system output buffer is flushed.**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The system output buffer is flushed, meaning any buffered output is sent to the console, but since no print statements were executed, this detail does not affect the variable states.
