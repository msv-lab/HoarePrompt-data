Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 in the `range(1, n)` function.
   - `n` is a positive integer input by the user.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute if `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `kp`, `g`, and `v1` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
