Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `2`, `n` must be greater than `2`, `v2` is `2`, `v1` is `1`, `g` is `0`, `r` is the string `<`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
