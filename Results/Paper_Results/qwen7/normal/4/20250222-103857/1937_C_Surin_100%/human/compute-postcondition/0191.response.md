Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `v2` is 2
   - `v1` is 2
   - The postcondition states that if the input string `r` is '<', then `v1` is set to 2. Otherwise, the value of `v1` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `v1` and `v2` should remain unchanged unless the condition in the postcondition changes the value of `v1`.

4. **Considering the Postcondition:**
   - Since the postcondition does not provide any new information about `r` (the input string), and `v1` was already set to 2, it will remain 2 unless `r` is '<'. However, since no new information about `r` is given, we assume `v1` remains 2.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `v2` remains 2.
   - `v1` remains 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `v2` is 2, `v1` is 2**
