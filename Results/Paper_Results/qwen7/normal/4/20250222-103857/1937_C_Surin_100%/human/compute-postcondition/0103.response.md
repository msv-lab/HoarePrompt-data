Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prev` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `1`
   - `n` must be greater than `1`
   - `v2` is `1`
   - `v1` is `1`
   - `g` is `0`
   - `r` is the string `<`

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1` and `n` must be greater than `1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `2` and `n` should still be greater than `2`.

4. **Adjust the relevant states**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented to `2`.
   - `n` must remain greater than `2` (since it was greater than `1` and no other condition affects it directly).

5. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - `prev`, `v2`, `v1`, `g`, and `r` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `2`, `n` must be greater than `2`, `v2` is `1`, `v1` is `1`, `g` is `0`, `r` is the string `<`**
