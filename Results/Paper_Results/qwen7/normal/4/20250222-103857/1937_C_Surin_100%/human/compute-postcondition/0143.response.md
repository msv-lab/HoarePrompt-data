Output State: **`r` is an input string, if `r` equals '>', then `prev` is an input integer, if `r` equals '=', then `r2` is the input string from the user, and if `r2` equals '<', then `prev` is set to `i+1`, `i` is `i+1`, `n` must be greater than `i+1`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
