Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `v2` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

However, the value of `v1` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `v1` is not defined or given any value, it is not clear what `v1` should be. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values to be printed for `v1`.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that the print statement will include `v1` twice and `v2` twice, with `v2` being 1.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 1 1**
