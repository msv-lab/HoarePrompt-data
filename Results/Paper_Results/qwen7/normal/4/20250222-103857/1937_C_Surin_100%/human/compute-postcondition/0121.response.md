Output State: **`prev` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `v1` is `n-1`, `g` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `prev = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `prev`. Since `prev` was previously `n-1`, this assignment changes its value to `0`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `v2`, `v1`, `g`) remain unchanged from their previous values as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions and values specified in the initial state except for `prev`, which is now `0`.
