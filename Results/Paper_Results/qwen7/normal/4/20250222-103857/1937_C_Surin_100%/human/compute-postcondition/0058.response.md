Output State: **`prev` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `n` must be at least 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect any variable values or add new information. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
