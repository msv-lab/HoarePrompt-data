Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
1. **Input**: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_i \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
2. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Alice wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers is non-zero, and Bob wins otherwise.
3. **Strategy**: Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers strategically.

### Given Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( a, b, c, d \).

2. **Calculation**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the total number of even numbers divided by 2. This part counts the number of pairs of even numbers (since each pair contributes to zero XOR).
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, c \) when divided by 2 equals 3. If true, it adds 1 to the count.

### Reasoning
- **Even Numbers Contribution**: 
  - Each pair of even numbers (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) results in a zero XOR. Thus, counting pairs of even numbers directly contributes to Bob's wins.
- **Odd Remainder Check**:
  - The condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, c \) when divided by 2 equals 3. This ensures that there are exactly 3 odd numbers among \( a, b, c \). In this scenario, Eve can remove two of these odd numbers, leaving one odd number, which will result in a non-zero XOR (Alice wins). Therefore, adding 1 to the count here ensures that Bob wins once.

### Correctness Verification
- The logic correctly accounts for pairs of even numbers contributing to Bob's wins.
- The check for the sum of remainders ensuring exactly 3 odd numbers is correctly implemented to ensure Bob wins once in such a case.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the strategy to maximize Bob's wins based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
