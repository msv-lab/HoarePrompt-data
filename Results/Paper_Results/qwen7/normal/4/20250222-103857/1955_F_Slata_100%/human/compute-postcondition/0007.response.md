Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into four parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
