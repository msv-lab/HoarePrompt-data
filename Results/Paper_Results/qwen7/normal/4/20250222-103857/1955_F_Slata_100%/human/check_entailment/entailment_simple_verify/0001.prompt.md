You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: `i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input, `d` is the fourth integer input, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
1. **Input**: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_i \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
2. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Alice wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers is non-zero, and Bob wins otherwise.
3. **Strategy**: Eve aims to maximize Bob's wins by removing numbers strategically.

### Given Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( a, b, c, d \).

2. **Calculation**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the total number of even numbers divided by 2. This part counts the number of pairs of even numbers (since each pair contributes to zero XOR).
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, c \) when divided by 2 equals 3. If true, it adds 1 to the count.

### Reasoning
- **Even Numbers Contribution**: 
  - Each pair of even numbers (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) results in a zero XOR. Thus, counting pairs of even numbers directly contributes to Bob's wins.
- **Odd Remainder Check**:
  - The condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of \( a, b, c \) when divided by 2 equals 3. This ensures that there are exactly 3 odd numbers among \( a, b, c \). In this scenario, Eve can remove two of these odd numbers, leaving one odd number, which will result in a non-zero XOR (Alice wins). Therefore, adding 1 to the count here ensures that Bob wins once.

### Correctness Verification
- The logic correctly accounts for pairs of even numbers contributing to Bob's wins.
- The check for the sum of remainders ensuring exactly 3 odd numbers is correctly implemented to ensure Bob wins once in such a case.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the strategy to maximize Bob's wins based on the provided problem description.
