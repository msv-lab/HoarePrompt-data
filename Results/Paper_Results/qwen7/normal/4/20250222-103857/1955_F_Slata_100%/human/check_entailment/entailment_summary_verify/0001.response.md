### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the solution step by step to confirm its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \(a, b, c, d\) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the total number of pairs of even numbers. Since each pair of even numbers (e.g., (1, 1), (2, 2), etc.) results in a zero XOR, these pairs contribute to Bob's wins.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of \(a, b, c\) when divided by 2 equals 3. This condition ensures that there are exactly 3 odd numbers among \(a, b, c\). In this case, Eve can remove two of these odd numbers, leaving one odd number, which will result in a non-zero XOR (Alice wins). Therefore, adding 1 to the count ensures that Bob wins once.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly accounts for pairs of even numbers contributing to Bob's wins.
   - The check for the sum of remainders ensuring exactly 3 odd numbers is correctly implemented to ensure Bob wins once in such a case.

Given the problem description and the function summary, the program accurately implements the strategy to maximize Bob's wins. The original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation
