Reasoning:
1. The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
2. The provided program defines a function `func()` that reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` and then checks if `x` is greater than `y`.
4. If `x` is greater than `y`, it prints `(x, y)`, otherwise it prints `(y, x)`.
5. This logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers.
6. The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the expected results.

Given this analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
