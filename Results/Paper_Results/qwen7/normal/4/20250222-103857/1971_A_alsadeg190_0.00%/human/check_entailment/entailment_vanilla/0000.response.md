### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then runs a loop `x` times to process each test case.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
4. **Comparing and Printing**: It compares `x` and `y` and prints them in ascending order (i.e., the smaller number first, followed by the larger number).

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `x > y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
- If `y > x`, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

This logic correctly outputs the minimum value first and the maximum value second for each pair of integers.

### Example Analysis:
- For the input `1 9`, the output should be `1 9` because 1 is the minimum and 9 is the maximum.
- For the input `8 4`, the output should be `4 8` because 4 is the minimum and 8 is the maximum.
- For the input `1 4`, the output should be `1 4` because 1 is the minimum and 4 is the maximum.
- And so on...

The program correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the required functionality.

### Final Answer:
