### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It works correctly for identifying palindromic strings.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it tries to find a character that differs from the first character at position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`).
     - If such a character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the remaining part is a palindrome.
       - If the remaining part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
       - If the split is at the middle of the string (i.e., `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`), it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is not a palindrome by printing "YES" and the string itself.
   - It also correctly identifies the middle of the string and handles cases where the string is symmetric around the middle.
   - The function can handle cases where the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The function correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It handles various edge cases and provides the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and outputs the result in the required format.

**Correctness: **True**
