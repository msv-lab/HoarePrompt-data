Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed its execution.
- `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, indicating the position of the first non-matching character or a specific midpoint value.
- The condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == True` holds true, meaning that the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the substring starting from `x + 1`.

Given this information, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
