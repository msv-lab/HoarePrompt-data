### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it tries to find a character that differs from the first character at position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`).
     - If such a character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the remaining part is a palindrome.
       - If the remaining part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
       - If the split is at the middle of the string (i.e., `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`), it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO".

   - However, there are several issues with the logic:
     - The function only checks for the first differing character and splits the string at that point. This approach might not always yield a valid partition.
     - The function does not handle cases where the string has multiple possible partitions into non-palindromic substrings.
     - The function does not ensure that the partitions are indeed non-palindromic after the split.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is not a palindrome by printing "YES" and the string itself.
   - It also correctly identifies the middle of the string and handles cases where the string is symmetric around the middle.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic parts.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The function does not guarantee that the partitions are non-palindromic after the split.
   - It may miss valid partitions and incorrectly identify strings as having no valid partitions.
   - The function does not cover all possible scenarios where a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. There are logical flaws in the partitioning logic that can lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
