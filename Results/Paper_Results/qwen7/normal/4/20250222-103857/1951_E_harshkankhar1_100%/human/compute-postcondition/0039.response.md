Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times. Additionally, the condition `func_1(s[x + 1:]) == True` holds true, and the current value of `x` is either 1 or half of `n`.
