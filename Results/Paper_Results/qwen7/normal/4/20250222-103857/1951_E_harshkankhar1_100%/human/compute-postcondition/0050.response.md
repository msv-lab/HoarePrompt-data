Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists), and the loop has executed `n-1` times. Additionally, the condition `x != -1` holds true. Furthermore, if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, `x` remains unchanged. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, `x` is set to either 1, `n // 2`, or left as -1, ensuring it still satisfies the condition `x != -1`.
