Reasoning:
- The problem requires checking if a string can be partitioned into substrings where no substring is a palindrome.
- We have two functions: `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome, and `func_2` attempts to partition the string according to the problem requirements.
- `func_2` logic:
  1. It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If true, it prints "YES" with 1 part and the string itself.
  2. If the first character is repeated elsewhere in the string, it finds the first such character and splits the string at that point.
  3. It then checks if the substring after the split is a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" with 2 parts and the split substrings.
  4. If the split point is at the beginning or middle of the string, it prints "NO".
  5. Otherwise, it prints "YES" with 2 parts and the split substrings.
- This logic correctly addresses the problem statement and handles all edge cases as per the examples provided.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the function `func_2` correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
