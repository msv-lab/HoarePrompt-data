Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `x` is either -1 or the index where the first non-matching character is found (if such an index exists).
- The loop has executed `n-1` times.
- The condition `x != -1` holds true.
- The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

From this, we can deduce the following:

1. Since the loop has executed `n-1` times and `i` is now equal to `n`, it means the loop has completed its execution.
2. The condition `x != -1` indicates that there was a non-matching character found during the loop's execution.
3. The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returning `False` implies that the substring starting from index `x + 1` does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`.

Given these points, `x` must be the index of the first non-matching character, and `s[x + 1:]` is the substring starting from `x + 1` which does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the substring up to and including the non-matching character, followed by a space, and then the substring starting from the next character after the non-matching one.

Output: **s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:]**
