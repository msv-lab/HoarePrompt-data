Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1, so the condition `i < n` will be true as long as `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial states:
- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
