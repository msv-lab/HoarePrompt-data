### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It works correctly for identifying palindromic strings.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it tries to find a character that differs from the first character at position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`).
     - If such a character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the remaining part is a palindrome.
       - If the remaining part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
       - If the split is at the middle of the string (i.e., `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`), it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two partitions.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is not a palindrome by printing "YES" and the string itself.
   - However, the function does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider certain scenarios where the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function correctly identifies when the entire string is a palindrome and prints "NO" in such cases.
   - The function also correctly identifies when a split at a specific position results in non-palindromic substrings.
   - However, the function fails to handle cases where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic substrings. For example, the string "aab" should be partitioned into "a" and "b", but the function only considers splitting at positions where the first character differs from the subsequent characters.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the string "aab":
     - The function will check if "aab" is a palindrome, which it is not.
     - It then tries to find a character that differs from the first character. It finds that "a" and "b" differ.
     - It splits the string at the first position, resulting in "a" and "b".
     - However, the function only prints "YES" and the two partitions without considering that "aab" can be partitioned into "aa" and "b" as well.
   - Another example, "ababa":
     - The function will check if "ababa" is a palindrome, which it is.
     - It will then try to find a character that differs from the first character. Since no such character exists, it prints "NO".
     - However, "ababa" can be partitioned into "aba" and "ba" (or other valid partitions).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. It fails to handle cases where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic substrings.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
