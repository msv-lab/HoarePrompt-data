Output State: **`len(path_ba) - ci1` must be a positive even number, `i` is 7, `ops` contains the tuples (`c2`, 2), (`c1`, 5), and (`c2`, 7)**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is initially 5, after executing the code, `i` is incremented by 2 (since `i += 2` is implied by the initial state and the operation), making `i` equal to 7. The list `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 5) and (`c2`, 2), and after appending, it also includes (`c2`, 7). The condition and the value of `i` are updated accordingly, while the condition about `len(path_ba) - ci1` remains unchanged.
