Output State: `i` is equal to `ci`; `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each in the form `(c, index)`, where `index` ranges from `0` to `ci`.

Explanation: The loop runs `ci + 1` times, where `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `ci`. The list `ops` will contain `ci + 1` tuples, with each tuple being `(c, index)`, where `index` starts from `0` and increments by `1` up to `ci`.
