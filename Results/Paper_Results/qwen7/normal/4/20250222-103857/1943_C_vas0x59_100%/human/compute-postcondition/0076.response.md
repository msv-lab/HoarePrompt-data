Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is equal to `ci`, where `ci` is `len(path_ba) // 2`.
     - This means `i` is the floor division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
   - `ops` is a list containing `ci + 1` tuples, each in the form `(c, index)`, where `index` ranges from `0` to `ci` if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`.
     - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains `ci + 1` tuples, each with `c` being either `c1` or `c2` and `index` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
     - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `len(path_ba) - ci` must be a positive even number, and `i` is equal to the second last index of `path_ba`.
       - Since `i` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, and `i` is the second last index, `len(path_ba)` must be even and `len(path_ba) = 2 * (ci + 1)`.
       - Therefore, `ops` contains tuples where each tuple consists of either `c1` or `c2` paired with every even index from `1` up to and including the second last index of `path_ba`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is:
     ```python
     print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
     ```
     - `map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops)` applies the lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
     - The lambda function takes a tuple `x` and returns a string in the format `'x[0] + 1 x[1]'`.
     - `*` unpacks the map object into arguments for the `print` function.
     - `sep='\n'` ensures that each string is printed on a new line.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Given the initial state, `ops` contains tuples where each tuple consists of either `c1` or `c2` paired with every even index from `1` up to and including the second last index of `path_ba`.
   - For each tuple `(c, index)` in `ops`, the lambda function will generate a string in the format `'c + 1 index'`.

Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each containing a string in the format `'c + 1 index'` for each tuple in `ops`.

Output: **'c1 + 1 0' 'c1 + 1 2' ... 'c2 + 1 i-1'** (where `i` is the second last index of `path_ba` and `ops` contains tuples with `c1` or `c2` paired with every even index from `1` up to and including `i-1`)
