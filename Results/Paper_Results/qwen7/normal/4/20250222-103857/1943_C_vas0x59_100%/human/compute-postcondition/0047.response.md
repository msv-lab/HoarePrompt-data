Postcondition: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `-1`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values that were appended during the loop iterations until `n` became `-1`, `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is odd**.
