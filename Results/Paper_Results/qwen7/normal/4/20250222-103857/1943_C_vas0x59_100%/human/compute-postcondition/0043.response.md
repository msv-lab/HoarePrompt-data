Output State: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n`, and `n`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Since `path_ba` originally contained `[b, n]`, after appending `n`, `path_ba` becomes `[b, n, n]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
