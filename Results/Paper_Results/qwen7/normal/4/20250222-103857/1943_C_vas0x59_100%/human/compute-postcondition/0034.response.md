The `while True` loop does not depend on any specific condition outside the loop itself. Therefore, we do not need to adjust any states based on external conditions. Since the loop is unconditionally true, it can always execute another iteration.

Given this, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `-1`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`; `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `-1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
