Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, integers n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented as x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5). For each test case, it processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**
