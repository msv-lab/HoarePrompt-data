Output State: `i` is equal to `x`, `ans` is equal to `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.

After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `x`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration starting from 0. The loop continues until `i` reaches `x`. The variable `ans` is incremented by 1 each time the conditions `t1 not in present and t2 in present` are met. Since the problem statement indicates that the loop updates `ans` to `x` if these conditions are satisfied for all `i` from 0 to `x-1`, `ans` will be equal to `x`. The values of `t1` and `t2` will be the results of `(a[i] + 1) % n` and `(a[i] + 2) % n` respectively, with `i` being the last value it takes, which is `x-1`.
