Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[2 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[2] - 1`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is initially set to 2.
- The variable `x` must be greater than 1.
- The variable `next_elem` is defined as `a[1 % x] + n` if `x` is greater than 1, otherwise it is `a[0]`. Since `x` must be greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[1 % x] + n`.
- The variable `gap` is defined as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. After the code execution, `next_elem` is updated to `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, which simplifies to `a[2 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0)` since `i` is 2. Therefore, `gap` is now `a[2 % x] + (n if 2 == x - 1 else 0) - a[2] - 1`.
