Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x`, `ans` will still be equal to the initial value of `x`, `t1` and `t2` will retain their initial values, `gaps` will contain a list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop:
- The variable `i` will have been incremented to `x` as the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`.
- The variable `ans` remains unchanged and is still equal to the initial value of `x`.
- The variables `t1` and `t2` are not modified within the loop and thus retain their initial values.
- The `gaps` list will contain all the positive differences (`gap`) calculated for each iteration where `next_elem - a[i] - 1 > 0`. These differences are computed based on the array `a` and the modulo operation with `n`.
