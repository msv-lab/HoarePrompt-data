The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). It reads a list of integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie and calculates a result based on specific conditions. The function ultimately prints the sum of certain gaps between consecutive vertices, adjusted by the value of \( y \).
