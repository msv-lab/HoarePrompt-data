Output State: **After sorting, the variable `gaps` contains a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0. The variables `i`, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their initial values.**

This means that the `gaps` list has been sorted in ascending order, while the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
