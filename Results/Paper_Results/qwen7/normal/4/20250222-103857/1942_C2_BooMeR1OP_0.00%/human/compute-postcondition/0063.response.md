Output State: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented by the value of `gap`, `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, `pairs` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is adjusted accordingly.**

Explanation: The line `ans += gap` increments the value of `ans` by the current value of `gap`. All other variables (`gaps`, `i`, `t1`, `t2`, `pairs`, and `y`) retain their initial values or are updated as specified in the problem statement.
