Output State: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented by `gap`, `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is now equal to `y - pairs`.**

This means that the value of `y` has been decreased by the number of `pairs`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
