Postcondition: **`gaps` is a sorted list of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` modulo `n`, provided these differences are greater than 0, `i` retains its initial value, `ans` is incremented by either `gap` (if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`) or increased by 2 times the value of `y` (if `y` is less than `pairs`), `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` is now equal to `gap // 2`, and `y` is adjusted accordingly.**
