Output State: `i` is equal to `x`, `ans` is equal to `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`.

After all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will be equal to `x`, as the loop increments `i` in each iteration. The loop continues to execute until all elements in the list `a` have been processed, i.e., `i` reaches `x`. During each iteration, `ans` is incremented by 1 if the conditions `t1 not in present` and `t2 in present` are met. Since the loop processes each element in the list `a` exactly once, `ans` will be incremented `x` times, making its final value equal to `x`. The values of `t1` and `t2` will be `(a[x-1] + 1) % n` and `(a[x-1] + 2) % n` respectively, as these are the last values computed in the loop.
