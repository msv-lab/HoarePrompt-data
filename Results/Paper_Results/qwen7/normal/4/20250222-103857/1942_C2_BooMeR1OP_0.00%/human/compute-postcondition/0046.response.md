Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 1, `next_elem` is `a[4 % x] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[4 % x]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `gaps` list has the value of `gap` appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `gaps.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. The values of `i`, `x`, `next_elem`, and `gap` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `gaps` now contains the calculated value of `gap`.
