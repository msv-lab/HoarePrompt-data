Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 1, `t1` is (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is (a[i] + 2) % n and is in present**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Given that `i` is 2, `t2` now becomes `(a[2] + 2) % n`. The values of `i`, `ans`, `t1`, and the condition of `t2` being in `present` remain unchanged.
