Output State: **`i` is 0; `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n; `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 0.
- `t1` is calculated as `(a[0] + 1) % n`.
- The code then assigns `(a[i] + 2) % n` to `t2`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`, so `t2` is calculated as `(a[0] + 2) % n`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
