Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(a)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so its value does not need to be adjusted.
   - `a` is an integer obtained from input. The exact value of `a` is not known, but it must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(a)` will execute if `a` is a positive integer (greater than 0).

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `a` is a positive integer for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be a positive integer**
