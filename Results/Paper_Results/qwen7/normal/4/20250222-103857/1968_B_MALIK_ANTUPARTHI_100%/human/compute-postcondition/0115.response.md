Output State: **`j` is `j_current + 1`; `k` is `j_current + 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `j` (which is `j_current + 1`) to `k`. Therefore, both `j` and `k` now hold the same value, which is `j_current + 1`. The initial state of `j` being `j_current + 1` remains unchanged except that it is now also assigned to `k`.
