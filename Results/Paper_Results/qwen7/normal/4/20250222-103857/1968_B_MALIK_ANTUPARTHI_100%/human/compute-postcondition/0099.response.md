Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `j` and `b`.
2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `j` is 0
   - `b` is greater than 0
   - `i` is `b + 1`
   - `k` is either `j + 1 + k` or 0, depending on whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` starts from 0 and the loop runs for `b` iterations, the next value of `j` should be 1.
   - The value of `b` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `i` is derived from `b + 1`, so if `b` remains the same, `i` will be `b + 1` again.
   - The value of `k` depends on the condition inside the loop. Since the loop hasn't executed yet for `j = 1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `k` without knowing the result of the condition check for `d[j]` in `e[k:]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j` and the unchanged values of `b` and `i`. The value of `k` remains indeterminate until the loop body is executed.

**State:**
**`j` is 1, `b` is greater than 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is either `j + 1 + k` or 0, depending on whether `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` or not.**
