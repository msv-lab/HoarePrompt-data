State: **`j` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `b + 1`** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `j` and the integer `b`.
2. The loop `for j in range(b)` will execute as long as `b` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The initial value of `j` is 0, which means the loop will start its first iteration when `j` becomes 1.
4. The value of `i` being `b + 1` is not directly related to the loop's execution but is part of the given program state.
5. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `b` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` is 0 and `b` must be greater than 0.
