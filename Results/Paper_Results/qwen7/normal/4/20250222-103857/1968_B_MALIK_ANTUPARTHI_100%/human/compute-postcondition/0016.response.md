Output State: **`j` is 0; `k` is 0; `b` must be greater than 0; the element `d[j]` is not in the slice `e[k:]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `k`, `b`, or the relationship between the list elements `d[j]` and the slice `e[k:]`. It only indicates that the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within.
