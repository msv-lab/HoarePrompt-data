Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement was provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
