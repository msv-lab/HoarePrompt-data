Output State: `x` is 0, `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `num_tests` is `num_tests - 3`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will have gone through all the indices of the `nums` list and will end up being 0. The value of `start_year` will be updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration, resulting in a complex expression involving all elements of `nums`. Specifically, it will go through each element of `nums` in reverse order (from the last to the first), applying the given formula iteratively. The `num_tests` variable will be reduced by the total number of iterations, which is the length of the `nums` list.
