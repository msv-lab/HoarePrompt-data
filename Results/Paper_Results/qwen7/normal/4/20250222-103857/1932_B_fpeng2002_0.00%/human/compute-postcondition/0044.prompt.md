Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be updated to the value of `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`. This means that `start_year` will be adjusted based on the last element in the `nums` list after processing each element in the list exactly once. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) retain their initial or previously determined states as they are not affected by the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of `nums` minus one; `start_year` is ((((...(((start_year + 1) // nums[0]) + 1) * nums[0]) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[len(nums)-2] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-2]) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1].

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the length of the list `nums` minus one (i.e., `x` will be the last index of the list). The value of `start_year` will be the result of applying the formula `(((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])` iteratively for each element in the list `nums`, starting from `x=0` up to `x=len(nums)-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `x` is 0, `start_year` is (((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `num_tests` is `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `x` will be 0 because the loop decrements `x` until it reaches 0. The variable `start_year` will be updated through a series of operations involving each element in the `nums` list, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. Specifically, `start_year` will be calculated as (((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]. The variable `num_tests` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The lists `nums` and the integer `n` also remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
