Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `x` and it ranges from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1`
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`
   - `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
   - `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input
   - `n` is an input integer

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `x` will be `x + 1`.
   - Given that `x` is currently `len(nums) - 1`, the next value of `x` will be `len(nums) - 1 + 1 = len(nums)`.
   - However, since the loop condition is `x < len(nums)`, when `x` becomes equal to `len(nums)`, the loop will terminate.

4. **Update the relevant states**:
   - `x` will be `len(nums)` (since the loop will terminate when `x` equals `len(nums)`).
   - `start_year` remains unchanged because it is not directly dependent on `x` in the loop.
   - `num_tests` will be `num_tests - 1` minus one more, so it will be `num_tests - 2`.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` is `len(nums)`
   - `start_year` remains the same: `((start_year + 1) // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]`
   - `num_tests` is `num_tests - 2`
   - `nums` remains the same
   - `n` remains the same

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would actually be the final iteration before the loop terminates) is:

State: **`x` is `len(nums)`, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer**
