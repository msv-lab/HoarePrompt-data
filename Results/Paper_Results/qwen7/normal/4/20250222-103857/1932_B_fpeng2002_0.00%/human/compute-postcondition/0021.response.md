Output State: **`x` is 0; `start_year` is (((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[0]` + 1) * `nums[0]`).**

Explanation: The variable `x` is initially set to 0, and `start_year` is updated based on the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `x` is 0, `nums[x]` refers to the first element of the list `nums`. The value of `start_year` is recalculated using this formula, and the updated value of `start_year` is stored back into `start_year`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
