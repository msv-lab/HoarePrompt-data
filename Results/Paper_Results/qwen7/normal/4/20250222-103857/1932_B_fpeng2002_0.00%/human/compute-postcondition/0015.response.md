The loop head contains the variable `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that variable. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.**
