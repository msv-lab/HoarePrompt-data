Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`num_tests`, `nums`, and `start_year`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
