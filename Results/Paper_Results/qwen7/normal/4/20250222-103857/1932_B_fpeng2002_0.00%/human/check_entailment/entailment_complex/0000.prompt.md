Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `start_year` is (((((...(((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[len(nums)-2] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-2]) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1], `num_tests` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `x` will be 0 because the loop decrements `x` until it reaches 0. The variable `start_year` will be updated through a series of operations involving each element in the `nums` list, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. Specifically, `start_year` will be calculated as (((((...(((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[len(nums)-2] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-2]) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]. The variable `num_tests` will be 0 because the loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 in each iteration until it becomes 0. The lists `nums` and the integer `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a sequence of n integers. It then calculates a value `start_year` based on these integers using a specific formula and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated `start_year` values for each case.
