Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of subsequent test cases, followed by t pairs of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and the sequence a_i.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but rather processes input data through a series of test cases, each containing a count of sub-cases (t), the number of elements in each sub-case (n), and a sequence of integers (a_i). The function then returns outputs based on the values of n and the sequence a_i for each sub-case.
