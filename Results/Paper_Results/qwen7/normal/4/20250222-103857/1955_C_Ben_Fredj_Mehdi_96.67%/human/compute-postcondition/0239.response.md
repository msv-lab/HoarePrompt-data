Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 4`; `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 3`; `i` is `i + 1`; `k` remains the same; `g` is increased by 1; `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. The other variables (`a[g]`, `a[d]`, `i`, `k`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their previous states unless specified otherwise. Since no conditions are met that would affect `d` (i.e., `a[d]` does not equal 0), `d` remains unchanged.
