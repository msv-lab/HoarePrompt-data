Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t, followed by n and k, and a list a of n integers. Based on specific conditions involving n and k, the function prints a specific integer value or the count of zeros in the list a after performing certain operations. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the results for each test case.**
