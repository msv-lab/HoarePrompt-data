Output State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 2`, `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same**

Explanation: The code `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` was supposed to be `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`, but it has been corrected to `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1`. This means that `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`, which aligns with the original intended behavior. The other variables remain unchanged: `a[g]` is still `int(a[g]) - 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains the same.
