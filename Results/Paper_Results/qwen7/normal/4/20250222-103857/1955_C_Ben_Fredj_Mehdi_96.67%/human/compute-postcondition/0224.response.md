Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Potential Exception Points**: 
   - The code inside the `try` block attempts to convert `a[g]` and `a[d]` to integers and perform subtraction operations. This can lead to a `ValueError` if `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to an integer.
   - There is also a possibility of an `IndexError` if `g` or `d` is out of the bounds of the list `a`.

2. **What the Try Except Statement Accomplishes**:
   - If the operations inside the `try` block execute without raising an exception, the following actions are taken:
     - `a[g]` is set to `int(a[g]) - 1`.
     - `a[d]` is set to `int(a[d]) - 1`.
     - If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1.
     - If `a[d]` becomes 0, `a[d]` is set to `int(a[d]) - 2`, `g` is incremented by 1, and `d` is decremented by 1.
   - If an exception occurs, the `except` block is executed, and the loop is broken using `break`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - If no exceptions occur, the values of `a[g]` and `a[d]` are updated according to the conditions mentioned above.
   - If an exception occurs, the loop is exited, and the state of the variables is unknown due to the nature of the `except` block.

Output State: **`a[g]` is either `int(a[g]) - 1` or `0` (if it was `int(a[g]) - 1` and became 0), and `a[d]` is either `int(a[d]) - 1` or `int(a[d]) - 2` (if it was `int(a[d]) - 1` and became 0). If an exception occurs, the loop is broken and the state of `a[g]`, `a[d]`, `g`, and `d` is unknown.**
