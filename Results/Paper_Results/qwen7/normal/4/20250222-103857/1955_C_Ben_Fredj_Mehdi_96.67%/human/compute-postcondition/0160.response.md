Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `n` equals 20 and `k` equals 10000000000, then `k` remains 10000000000. Otherwise, if `k` equals 5999999999, `k` remains 5999999999. If `k` equals 4294967295, `k` remains 4294967295. If `k` equals 3000000000, `k` remains 3000000000. If `k` equals 2 and `n` equals 2, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` does not equal 2 or `n` does not equal 2, `k` is not equal to the second element of `a` minus 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `k` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `d` is set to `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`, `g` is set to `k // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.
