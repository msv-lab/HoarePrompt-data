Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and either `n` is not equal to 20 or `k` is not equal to 10000000000 or the first element of `a` is not 1000000000 or `k` is not equal to 200000000000 or `k` is not equal to 5999999999 or `k` is not equal to 4294967295. The current value of `n` is 2, the current value of `k` is the first element of `a` minus 1, and the current value of `k` is the second element of `a` minus 2.
