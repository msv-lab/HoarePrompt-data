Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 2, `g` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k // 2`, `a[d]` is decremented by 1. If `a[g]` (which is `a[2]`) is 0, then `a[2]` becomes 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
