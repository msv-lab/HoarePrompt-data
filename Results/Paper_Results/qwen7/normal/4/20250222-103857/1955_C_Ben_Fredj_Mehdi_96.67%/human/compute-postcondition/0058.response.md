Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- The conditions specify that either `n` is not equal to 101, `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, the first element of `a` is not 1, or `k` is not equal to 1000000000000.
- The current value of `k` is explicitly stated to be 200000000000.

Given this information, the print statement `print('200')` will simply print the string '200'.

Output: **200**
