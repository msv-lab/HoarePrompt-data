Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 0, and either `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1` or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`. If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the function breaks out of the loop or conditional block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 2, `g` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k // 2`, `a[d]` is decremented by 1. If `a[g]` (which is `a[2]`) is 0, then `a[2]` becomes 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is now `len(a) - 3`, `g` is 3, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k // 2 + 1`. If `a[d]` is 0, it remains 0; otherwise, `a[d]` is one less than its original value, and if `a[g]` is 0, `a[d]` is further decremented by 1. If an exception occurs during the execution of the try block, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
