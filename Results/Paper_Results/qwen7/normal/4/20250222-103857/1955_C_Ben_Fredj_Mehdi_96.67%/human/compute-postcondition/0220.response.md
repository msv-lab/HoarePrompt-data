Output State: **`a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 2`, `a[g]` is `0`, `g` is incremented by 1, and `d` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `a[d]` was `int(a[d]) - 1`, so now it becomes `int(a[d]) - 2`. The value of `a[g]` remains `0`, and `g` is incremented by 1 as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, `d` is also decremented by 1 from its previous value.
