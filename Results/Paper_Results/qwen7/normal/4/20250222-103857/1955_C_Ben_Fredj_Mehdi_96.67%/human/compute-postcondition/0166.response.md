Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `k` equals 200000000000, then `k` remains 200000000000. Otherwise, depending on the values of `n` and `k`, `k` is updated as follows: if `n` is 2 and `k` is 2147483648, then `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, `n` and `k` remain unchanged. If `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, `k` remains 10000000000. If `n` is 2 and `k` is 2, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is 5999999999, `k` remains 5999999999. If `k` is 4294967295, `k` remains 4294967295. If `k` is 3000000000, `k` remains 3000000000. If `k` is not 2 or `n` is not 2, `k` is not equal to the second element of `a` minus 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `k` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `d` is set to `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`, `g` is set to `k // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.**
