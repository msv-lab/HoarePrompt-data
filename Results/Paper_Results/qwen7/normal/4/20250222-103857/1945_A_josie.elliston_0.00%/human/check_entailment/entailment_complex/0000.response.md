### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - It checks if `extroverts` is divisible by 3.
     - If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, it means all extroverts can be placed in groups of 3 without needing additional universals.
     - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`. If true, it means we can use some universals to form complete groups of 3.
     - If neither condition is met, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to form complete groups of 3 with the given numbers of extroverts and universals.
   - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of tents required using the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to form complete groups of 3 with the extroverts and universals, and thus the function returns `-1`.
   - If `func_1` returns a value, it adds the number of introverts to this value and returns the result.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The program processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the appropriate input values.
   - For each test case, the program correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum number of tents needed or returning `-1` if it's impossible to satisfy all participants' preferences.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
