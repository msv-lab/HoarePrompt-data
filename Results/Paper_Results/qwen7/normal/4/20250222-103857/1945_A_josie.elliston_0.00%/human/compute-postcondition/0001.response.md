Output State: **The program returns introverts plus ret if ret is not None, otherwise it returns -1.**

Given the initial state:
- `introverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts.
- `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts.
- `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.
- `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.

The code checks if `ret` is `None`. If `ret` is `None`, the program returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `ret`, the final output depends on whether `ret` is `None` or not. If `ret` is not `None`, the program returns `introverts + ret`. If `ret` is `None`, the program returns `-1`.
