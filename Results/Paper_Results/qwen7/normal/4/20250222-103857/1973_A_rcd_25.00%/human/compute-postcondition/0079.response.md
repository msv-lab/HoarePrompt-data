Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low`, `high`, and `cur` retain their values from the previous iteration and are not directly involved in the current print statement.

The code snippet `print(p1 + p2)` will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Given that `p1` and `p2` are integers obtained from the input, the exact values of `p1` and `p2` depend on the input provided. However, we know that their sum is part of an odd sum with `p3`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers obtained from the input and their sum is part of an odd sum with p3)**
