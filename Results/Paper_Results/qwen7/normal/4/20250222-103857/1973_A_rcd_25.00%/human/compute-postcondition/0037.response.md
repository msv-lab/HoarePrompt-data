Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, with the additional condition that `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, and `cur` equals `high`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `cur` will eventually reach the value of `high`. This is because the loop continues to increment `cur` by 1 until the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, at which point it breaks out of the loop. Since `high` is initialized as the upper bound for `cur` and the loop continues to increment `cur` until it either breaks due to the condition being met or reaches `high`, `cur` will end up being equal to `high` when the loop completes.
