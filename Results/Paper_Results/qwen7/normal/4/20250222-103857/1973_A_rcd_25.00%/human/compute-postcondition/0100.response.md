Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, `cur` is increased by 1, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since the exact initial values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` are not specified, we keep the conditions and relationships between these variables as they are. The only change is that `cur` is now one more than its previous value.
