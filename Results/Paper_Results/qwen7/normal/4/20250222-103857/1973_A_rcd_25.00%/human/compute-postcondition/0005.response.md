Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will print the integer `-1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Output: **-1**
