Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is updated to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is updated to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is set to either `low` or `high` depending on whether `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`; if `cur` is set to `low`, `cur` remains unchanged; if `cur` is set to `high`, `cur` is increased by 1.
