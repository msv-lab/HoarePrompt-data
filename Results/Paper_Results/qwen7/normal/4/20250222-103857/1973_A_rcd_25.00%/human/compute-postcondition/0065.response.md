Given the initial state where `cur` is less than `high`, we need to determine the value of the expression `p1 - cur + p3` that will be printed.

- `cur` is explicitly stated to be less than `high`, but we do not have an explicit value for `cur`.
- Similarly, `p1` and `p3` are not defined in the initial state, so they remain as they are in the expression.

Since we don't have specific values for `p1` and `p3`, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables and the value of `cur`.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3**
