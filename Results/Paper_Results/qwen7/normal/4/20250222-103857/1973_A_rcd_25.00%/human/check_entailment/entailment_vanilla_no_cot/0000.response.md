Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Handling of Draw Conditions**: The logic to calculate the maximum number of draws is not correctly implemented. The current approach does not properly account for the distribution of points from draws and wins.

2. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the scores are inconsistent or do not allow for a valid set of games.

3. **Break Condition**: The `break` statement in the while loop might not be sufficient to ensure the maximum number of draws is found. The logic needs to be more robust to handle all possible scenarios.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a revised version of the solution that correctly handles the problem:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Total points must be even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        total_games = total_points // 2
        
        # Check if the scores can be achieved with valid games
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
            max_draws = (total_games - (p3 - p1) - (p3 - p2)) // 2
            if max_draws < 0:
                print(-1)
            else:
                print(max_draws)
        else:
            print(-1)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Total Points Check**: First, check if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. If not, print `-1` because the points cannot be distributed correctly among the players.

2. **Total Games Calculation**: Calculate the total number of games played using the total points. Each game contributes 2 points in total.

3. **Valid Scores Check**: Check if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores (`p1 + p2`). If not, print `-1` because the scores are inconsistent.

4. **Calculate Maximum Draws**: Calculate the maximum possible number of draws by ensuring the remaining points are distributed correctly among the players.

This solution ensures that all conditions are met and provides the correct output for the given problem.
