Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is set to the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is set to `low`. The current value of `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to the current value of `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
