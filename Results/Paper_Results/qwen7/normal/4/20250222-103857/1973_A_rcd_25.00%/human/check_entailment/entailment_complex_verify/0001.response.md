### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is necessary because each game contributes either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points in total (if it's a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct.

3. **Feasibility of Scores:**
   - The program then checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
   - If this condition is true, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws. For example, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the scores can be achieved through one win and one draw, but the current logic would incorrectly print `2` instead of `1`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above condition fails, the program performs a binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to the minimum and maximum possible values for the number of draws.
   - A loop is used to incrementally check the number of draws until the condition is met.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to ensure that the scores are achievable with the current number of draws.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. This logic is also incorrect because it doesn't correctly handle the constraints and edge cases.

#### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case: `1 1 1`**
  - The sum is even, but `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should handle this case differently, but it currently prints `-1` directly without further checks.

- **Test Case: `1 1 2`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should consider the possibility of one win and one draw, but it incorrectly prints `2`.

- **Test Case: `1 1 10`**
  - The sum is even, and `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
  - The program should calculate the maximum number of draws, but it incorrectly prints `2`.

#### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:
1. Check if the total points are even.
2. Calculate the maximum number of draws using a different approach.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            max_draws = (p1 + p2 + p3 - 2 * p3) // 2
            if max_draws < 0:
                print(-1)
            else:
                print(max_draws)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all edge cases correctly and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The given program has logical errors in handling the conditions and calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
