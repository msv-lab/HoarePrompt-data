Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `high` and `cur`.

3. **Analyze the Previous Iteration State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is calculated as `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is calculated as `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is either broken out of the most internal loop or if statement or incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Since `cur` is either broken out of the most internal loop or if statement or incremented by 1, the only way to ensure `high >= cur` is to adjust `high` such that it remains greater than or equal to the possible values of `cur`.

Given that `cur` could be incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `high` is at least `cur + 1` to guarantee that the loop can execute again. However, since `cur` could also be the result of an internal loop or if statement breaking, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where `cur` is maximized but still less than or equal to `high`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `high` to ensure it is greater than or equal to `cur`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 < p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1 > p3 - p2` else `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`**.
