Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the output state reflects that `t` is now an integer input within this range. The other conditions and constraints on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
