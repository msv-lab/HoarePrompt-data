Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning that `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers entered through the input during the loop's execution. The variable `n` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is the value provided as input. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). If the loop completes without any print statements of 'NO', it means that for every pair of integers `(a, b)` entered, the conditions `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` and `a / 2 != b and b / 2 != a` were satisfied, and thus each iteration printed 'YES'.
