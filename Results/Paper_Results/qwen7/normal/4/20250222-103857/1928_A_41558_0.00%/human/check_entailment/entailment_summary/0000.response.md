Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and reassembling them. The program correctly implements the logic based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be split into two smaller rectangles with integer sides without leaving a unit square unaccounted for, thus preventing the formation of a new rectangle.

2. **Half-Sized Rectangle Check**: If \(a\) is exactly half of \(b\) or vice versa, the program also prints 'NO'. This is correct because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, splitting the rectangle along the larger dimension results in two identical smaller rectangles, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle.

3. **Other Cases**: For all other cases, the program prints 'YES', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed. This is correct because in all other scenarios, there is a way to split the rectangle into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program correctly implements the required logic and handles all edge cases as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
