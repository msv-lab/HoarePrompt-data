Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. It reads pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\) for each test case.

2. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO', because an odd number cannot be divided into two equal parts without leaving a remainder, and thus no new distinct rectangle can be formed.
   - The program also checks if \(a\) is exactly half of \(b\) or vice versa. If this condition is met, it prints 'NO', because cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles would result in the same dimensions just rotated, which is considered the same rectangle.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES', indicating that a new distinct rectangle can be formed.

3. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` is correct and matches the requirements specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
