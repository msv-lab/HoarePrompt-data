Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy certain conditions. If either \(a\) or \(b\) is odd, or if \(a\) is exactly half of \(b\) or vice versa, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked.**
