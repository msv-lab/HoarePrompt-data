Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where both dimensions of the rectangle are even. According to the problem, if either dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. However, the current implementation only checks for the cases where both dimensions are odd and where one dimension is exactly half of the other. 

For example, consider the input `2 4`. In this case, both dimensions are even, and Bob can cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles and then rearrange them to form a 4x2 rectangle. The program would incorrectly output "NO" for this case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
