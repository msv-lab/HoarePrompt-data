### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob can cut a rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
- He can then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.
- The goal is to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given dimensions \(a \times b\).

#### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints 'NO'.
- It checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. If so, it prints 'NO'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program fails to handle the case where both dimensions are even.
- It claims that the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for even dimensions.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: 
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly prints 'NO' because there is no way to cut an odd-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides without leaving a remainder.
   
2. **One Dimension Half the Other**:
   - If one dimension is exactly half the other, the program correctly prints 'NO' because cutting the rectangle along the larger dimension will result in two rectangles that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.

3. **Even Dimensions Check**:
   - If both dimensions are even, the program should print 'YES' because Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with even dimensions and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - For example, for the input `2 4`, the program should print 'YES' because Bob can cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles and rearrange them to form a 4x2 rectangle.

Given the logic in the program, it correctly handles the cases where both dimensions are odd, one dimension is exactly half the other, and both dimensions are even. The program correctly prints 'YES' for even dimensions and 'NO' for the other cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description.

**Final: True**
