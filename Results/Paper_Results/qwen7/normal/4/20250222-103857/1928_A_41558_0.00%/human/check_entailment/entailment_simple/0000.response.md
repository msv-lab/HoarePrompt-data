Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
3. The program checks the following conditions to determine if another rectangle can be formed:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because cutting an odd-sized rectangle results in two smaller odd-sized rectangles, and no new distinct rectangle can be formed from them.
   - If either `a` or `b` is exactly twice the other, it prints 'NO' because cutting the rectangle along its longer side would result in two smaller rectangles that are essentially the same when rotated.
   - In all other cases, it prints 'YES', indicating that another distinct rectangle can be formed.
4. The program logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions.

Correctness: **True**
