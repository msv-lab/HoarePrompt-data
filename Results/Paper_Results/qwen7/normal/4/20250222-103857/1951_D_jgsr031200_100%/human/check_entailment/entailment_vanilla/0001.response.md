### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If Bob can achieve this, we need to output "YES" along with the number of stalls and their respective prices.
   - If it is impossible, we need to output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the number of jewels `k` Alice needs to buy.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis:**
   - The function checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1, which means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it directly prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with the given `n` and `k` using the `costs` array `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then checks if the sum of these jewels (`h`) is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO".
   - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for handling the case when `n == k` is correct.
   - The logic for handling the case when `n < k` is also correct.
   - However, the approach for setting up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` might not always work correctly. Specifically, the prices should be adjusted to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels across the stalls.
   - The current implementation assumes Alice will buy jewels from the first stall until she runs out of coins, then move to the next stall. This might not always result in buying exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the input `7 3`, the code correctly outputs "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - For the input `6 4`, the code incorrectly outputs "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `[6, 1]`, but this does not guarantee Alice will buy exactly 4 jewels.
   - For the input `255 8`, the code correctly outputs "YES" and sets up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in all cases. Therefore, the given program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
