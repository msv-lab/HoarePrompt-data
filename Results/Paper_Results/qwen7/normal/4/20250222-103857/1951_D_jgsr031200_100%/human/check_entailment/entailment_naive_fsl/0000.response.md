Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search and other methods that are not relevant to the problem. The core issue lies in how the program tries to set up the stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program uses binary search and other methods that are not aligned with the problem's requirements. It does not properly handle the setup of stalls and setting prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `(7, 3)`, the program outputs `YES` and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1. However, according to the problem description, Alice would buy 7 jewels if the price is 1, which is incorrect.
   - For the input `(6, 4)`, the program outputs `NO`, but it should output `YES` and set up stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.
   - For the input `(255, 8)`, the program outputs `YES` and sets up 2 stalls with prices `[128, 64]`. However, the correct solution should involve setting up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.

The program fails to correctly handle the setup of stalls and the pricing strategy to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
