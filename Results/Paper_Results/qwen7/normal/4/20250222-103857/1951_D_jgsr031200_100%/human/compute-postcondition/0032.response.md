Postcondition: **`h` is the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`. `n` is successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient, until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`. If `h` is less than `k` at the end of the process, the function continues as if `h` were less than `k`. Otherwise, the function ensures that `h` is at least `k` after the process completes.**
