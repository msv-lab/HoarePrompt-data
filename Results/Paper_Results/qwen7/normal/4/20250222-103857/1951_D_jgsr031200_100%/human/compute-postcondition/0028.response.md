Postcondition: **`h` will be the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`. `n` will be successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient, until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`. The final value of `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
