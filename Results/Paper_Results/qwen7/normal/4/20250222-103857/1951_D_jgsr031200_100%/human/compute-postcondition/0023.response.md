Output State: **`h` is `2 * h + curr`, `n` is decreased by the next `i * curr`, `curr` is `n // i`, `n` is `n - i * curr`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. The values of `h` and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial state. `curr` is recalculated as `n // i` after the subtraction, but since the code only updates `n`, the updated value of `n` is `n - i * curr`.
