Reasoning:

1. **Case when \( n = k \)**:
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' and then 1, 1.
   - This matches the requirement since if Alice has exactly \( k \) coins, she can buy exactly \( k \) jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each.

2. **Case when \( n < k \)**:
   - The program correctly prints 'NO'.
   - This matches the requirement since Alice cannot buy any jewels if she has fewer coins than the required number of jewels.

3. **Case when \( n \geq k \)**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the quotients obtained by dividing \( n \) by each element in the list `[n-k+1, 1]`.
   - It checks if this sum is less than \( k \). If it is, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and 2, followed by the list `[n-k+1, 1]`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- The program assumes that the only way to achieve exactly \( k \) jewels is by using exactly 2 stalls with prices `[n-k+1, 1]`. This is not always true. For example, if \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program would incorrectly print 'NO' because it does not consider other possible configurations like `[5, 5]` or `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.

- The program does not handle the general case where more than 2 stalls might be needed to achieve exactly \( k \) jewels. The logic should allow for more flexibility in setting up the stalls.

Given these points, the current implementation is incomplete and does not cover all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
