Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.**

This means that the initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged, while a new list `costs` is created with the specified values.
