### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If Bob can achieve this, we need to output "YES" along with the number of stalls and their respective prices.
   - If it is impossible, we need to output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the number of jewels `k` Alice needs to buy.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)` Analysis:**
   - The function checks if `n == k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1, which means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it directly prints "NO" because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy with the given `n` and `k` using the `costs` array `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then checks if the sum of these jewels (`h`) is less than `k`. If true, it prints "NO".
   - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for handling the case when `n == k` is correct.
   - The logic for handling the case when `n < k` is also correct.
   - However, the approach for setting up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` might not always work correctly. Specifically, the prices should be adjusted to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels across the stalls.
   - The current implementation assumes Alice will buy jewels from the first stall until she runs out of coins, then move to the next stall. This might not always result in buying exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the input `7 3`, the code correctly outputs "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - For the input `6 4`, the code incorrectly outputs "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `[6, 1]`, but this does not guarantee Alice will buy exactly 4 jewels.
   - For the input `255 8`, the code correctly outputs "YES" and sets up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case `7 3`:**
  - Alice has 7 coins and needs 3 jewels.
  - Setting up 1 stall with price 1 allows Alice to buy 3 jewels.
  - Correct output: "YES" and 1 stall with price 1.

- **Case `6 4`:**
  - Alice has 6 coins and needs 4 jewels.
  - Setting up 2 stalls with prices `[6, 1]`:
    - First stall: Alice buys 6 // 6 = 1 jewel, leaving 0 coins.
    - Second stall: Alice cannot buy any more jewels.
  - Incorrect output: "YES" instead of "NO".

- **Case `255 8`:**
  - Alice has 255 coins and needs 8 jewels.
  - Setting up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`:
    - First stall: Alice buys 128 // 128 = 1 jewel, leaving 127 coins.
    - Second stall: Alice buys 127 // 64 = 1 jewel, leaving 63 coins.
    - Third stall: Alice buys 63 // 32 = 1 jewel, leaving 31 coins.
    - Fourth stall: Alice buys 31 // 16 = 1 jewel, leaving 15 coins.
    - Fifth stall: Alice buys 15 // 8 = 1 jewel, leaving 7 coins.
    - Sixth stall: Alice buys 7 // 4 = 1 jewel, leaving 3 coins.
    - Seventh stall: Alice buys 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, leaving 1 coin.
    - Eighth stall: Alice buys 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, leaving 0 coins.
  - Correct output: "YES" and 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not handle the case where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels correctly in all scenarios. Specifically, the approach of setting up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` does not always ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
