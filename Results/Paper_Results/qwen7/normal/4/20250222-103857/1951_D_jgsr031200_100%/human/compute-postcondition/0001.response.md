Based on the initial state provided, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and n is equal to k. The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES'.

Since the value of `n` is equal to the value of `k`, and the print statement does not depend on these values but rather outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
