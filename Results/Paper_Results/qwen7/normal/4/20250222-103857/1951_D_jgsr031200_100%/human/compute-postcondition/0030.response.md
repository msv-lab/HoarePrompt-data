Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
- `n` is successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient.
- The process continues until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`.
- The final value of `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

However, the code snippet provided is simply:
```python
print(2)
```

This `print` statement will directly output the number 2, regardless of the initial state or the value of `h`.

Output: **2**
