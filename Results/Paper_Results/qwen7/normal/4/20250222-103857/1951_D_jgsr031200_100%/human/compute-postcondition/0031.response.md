Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is the sum of `curr` for each iteration, where `curr` is calculated as `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
- `n` is successively reduced by the product of each element in `costs` and its corresponding quotient.
- The process continues until `n` is no longer sufficient to divide by any element in `costs`.
- The final value of `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

However, the `print(*costs)` statement simply prints the elements of the `costs` list without any modifications. Since the exact values of `costs` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the list itself.

Output: **[list of elements in costs]**
