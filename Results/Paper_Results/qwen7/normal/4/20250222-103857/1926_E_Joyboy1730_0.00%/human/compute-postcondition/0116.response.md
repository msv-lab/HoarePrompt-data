Output State: **`tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is now `k - tot`, `pow` is now `pow * 2', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `tot`, `k`, or `pow`. Therefore, their values remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
