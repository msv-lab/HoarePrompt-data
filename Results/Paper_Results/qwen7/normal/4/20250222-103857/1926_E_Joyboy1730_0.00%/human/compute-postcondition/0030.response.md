Output State: **`L` must have at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the list `L`, but it indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no other variables are affected, the precondition that `L` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
