Output State: **`k` is now `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is 4, `m` is 0, `tot` is `tot + a`, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, `n` is 0.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `pow` by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. The other variables (`k`, `m`, `tot`, `a`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
