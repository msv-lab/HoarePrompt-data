Output State: **`k` is now `k - (tot + a)`, `pow` is 4, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, `a` is the next element in the list `L`, `n` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `k`, `pow`, `m`, `tot`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
