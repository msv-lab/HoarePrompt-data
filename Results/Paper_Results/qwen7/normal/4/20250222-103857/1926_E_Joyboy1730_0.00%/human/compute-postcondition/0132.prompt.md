Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
            break
        tot += a
        k -= tot
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `L` must contain at least three elements, `pow` is multiplied by \(2^3 = 8\), `tot` is the sum of the first three elements of `L`, and `k` is decreased by `tot`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `L` should have at least three elements. The value of `pow` will be \(2^3 = 8\) because it gets multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop. The variable `tot` will be the sum of the first three elements of `L` since it accumulates the values of `a` in each iteration. The value of `k` will be reduced by the sum of these three elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will continue to execute until `k` is no longer less than or equal to `tot + a`. At each iteration, `pow` doubles, `tot` accumulates the value of `a`, and `k` decreases accordingly. Once the loop completes all iterations, `pow` will be \(2^n\), where \(n\) is the number of times the loop executed. `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the list `L` up to the point where the loop condition fails. `m` remains 0, `k` will be less than `tot + a` for the last `a` in the list, and `n` will be the total number of iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `tot` is now `tot + a + a + a`, `k` is now `3 * (k - 3 * tot - 6 * a)`, `pow` is now `4 * 4 * 4`, and `pow` is equal to `64 * pow`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `tot` will be the sum of `a` added three times, `k` will be adjusted based on the total and the value of `a` added twice, and `pow` will be multiplied by 2 three times, resulting in a final value of 64.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
