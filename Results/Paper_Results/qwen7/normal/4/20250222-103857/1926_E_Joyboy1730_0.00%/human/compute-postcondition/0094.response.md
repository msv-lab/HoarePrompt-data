Output State: **`pow` will be \(2 \times \text{current pow}\), `tot` will be \(\text{current tot} + a\), `k` will be \(\text{current k} - 1\), `n` will be \(\text{current n} - m\), `L` is an empty list, `m` is \((\text{current n} + 1) // 2\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts the value of `m` from `n`. The value of `m` is defined as `(\text{current n} + 1) // 2`. After executing the code, the new value of `n` will be the original value of `n` minus `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
