Reasoning:
1. The program aims to simulate the process described in the problem statement.
2. It correctly initializes the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
3. However, the logic inside the loop does not accurately reflect the process described in the problem. Specifically:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is not used in the subsequent logic.
   - The list `L` is never populated with any values, and the logic to determine the k-th card is flawed.
   - The variable `tot` is initialized to 0 but is not used to accumulate the count of cards laid down.
   - The variable `pow` is set to `1` and then multiplied by `2` in a loop, but it is not used to determine the position of the k-th card.
4. The program attempts to find the k-th card by checking the accumulated total `tot` against `k`, but it does not correctly map the position of the k-th card based on the described process.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.

Correctness: **False**
