Output State: **`pow` will be \(2 \times \text{current pow}\), `tot` will be \(\text{current tot} + a\), `k` will be \(\text{current k} - 1\), `n` will be \(\text{current n} + 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them, and converts them to integers. These values are assigned to `n` and `k`. The other variables (`pow`, `tot`, and `a`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions. Therefore, `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, while `pow`, `tot`, and `a` retain their initial relationships.
