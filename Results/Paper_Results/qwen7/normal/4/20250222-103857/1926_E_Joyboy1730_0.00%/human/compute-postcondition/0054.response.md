Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `pow` is 16, `m` is (n + 1) // 2 - n, `tot` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts the value of `m` from `n`. Initially, `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`. After executing `n -= m`, the value of `n` is updated, and consequently, the value of `m` also changes because it depends on the new value of `n`. However, since the exact initial value of `n` is not specified, we express `m` in terms of the updated `n`. The other variables (`L`, `pow`, and `tot`) remain unchanged.
