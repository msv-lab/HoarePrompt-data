Output State: **`pow` will be \(2 \times \text{current pow}\), `tot` will be \(\text{current tot} + a\), `k` is an input integer - 1, `n` is `input integer - m - m`, `m` is \((\text{current n} - (\text{current n} - \text{current m})) // 2\), `L` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts `m` from `n`. The other variables (`pow`, `tot`, `k`, `m`, `L`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `n` is `input integer - m - m`, and the rest of the variables retain their initial relationships and values as described in the initial state.
