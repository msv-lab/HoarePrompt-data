Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input split from the user.
   - `a` is the second integer input split from the user.
   - `b` is the third integer input split from the user.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(ans + p2)
   ```

Given these details, let's determine the values of `ans` and `p2`:

- `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`. This means:
  - If `b - a + 1 <= n`, then `k = b - a + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `k = n`.

- `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. Let's simplify this expression:
  - Substitute `k` with the appropriate value.
  - For example, if `k = b - a + 1`, then `ans = int((b + (b - (b - a + 1) + 1)) / 2 * (b - a + 1)) = int((b + a) / 2 * (b - a + 1))`.

- `p2` is `(n - k) * a`. Again, substitute `k` with the appropriate value.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can express the final output in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of `ans` and `p2`:

Output: **int((b + a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)) + (n - (b - a + 1)) * a**
