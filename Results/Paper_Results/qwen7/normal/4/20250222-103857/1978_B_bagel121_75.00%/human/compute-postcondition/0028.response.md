Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`, `k` is updated to be the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the integer value of the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**.

Explanation: The line `p2 = (n - k) * a` does not change the value of `k` or `ans`. It only updates the value of `p2` based on the current values of `n`, `k`, and `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
