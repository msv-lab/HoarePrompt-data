Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as int((`b` + (`b` - `k` + 1)) / 2 * `k`).**

The code calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. Since `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is determined based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
