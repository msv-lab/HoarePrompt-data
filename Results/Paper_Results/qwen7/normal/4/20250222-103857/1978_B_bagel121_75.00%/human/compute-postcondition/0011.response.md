Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
