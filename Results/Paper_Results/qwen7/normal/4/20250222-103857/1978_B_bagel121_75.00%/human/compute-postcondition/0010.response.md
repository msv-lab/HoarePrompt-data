Let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `a` is the second integer input.
   - `b` is the third integer input.
   - `a` is less than `b`.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   ```python
   print(ans + p2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `a` and `b` are integers and `a < b`, let's denote them as `a = x` and `b = y` where `x < y`.
   - `k` is the minimum of `y - x + 1` and `n`. Let's denote `k` as `min(y - x + 1, n)`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((y + (y - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * x`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to print is `ans + p2`, which is `int((y + (y - k + 1)) / 2 * k) + (n - k) * x`.

Given the above breakdown, the output will be:

Output: **int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k) + (n - k) * a**
