### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The modified price for the first `k` buns is `(b - i + 1)` coins, where `i` ranges from `1` to `k`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If true, it prints `n * a` (since selling all buns at the usual price is optimal).
   - Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - It then calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - It calculates the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price: `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - Finally, it prints the total profit as `ans + p2`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating `k` is correct.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series is used correctly.
   - The program handles both cases (`a >= b` and `a < b`) appropriately.
   - The calculations for the profit are accurate and follow the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness:** **True**
