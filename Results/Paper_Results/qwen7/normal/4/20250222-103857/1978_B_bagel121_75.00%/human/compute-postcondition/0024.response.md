Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` directly. The values of `k`, `ans`, and `p2` are dependent on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, but their exact values are not specified until further calculations are performed. Therefore, the output state retains the conditions and dependencies as described, with `n`, `a`, and `b` being updated to the user's input values.
