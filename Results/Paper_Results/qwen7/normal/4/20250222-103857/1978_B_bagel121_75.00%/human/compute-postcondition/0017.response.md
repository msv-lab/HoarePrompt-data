Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input split from the user, `a` is the second integer input split from the user, `b` is the third integer input split from the user, `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `ans` using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. Here, `k` is determined as the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `ans` is updated with the calculated value based on the given formula.
