Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input**.

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 0.
