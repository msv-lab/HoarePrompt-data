Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is the first integer input split from the user.
- `a` is the second integer input split from the user.
- `b` is the third integer input split from the user.
- `k` is the minimum value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

The `print(n * a)` statement will print the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are the first and second integer inputs from the user, respectively)**
