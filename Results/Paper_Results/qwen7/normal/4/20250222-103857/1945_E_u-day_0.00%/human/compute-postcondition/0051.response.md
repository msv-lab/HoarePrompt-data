Postcondition: **The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, the final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`. The set `st` will contain all the unique values of `mid` that were computed during each iteration of the loop. Whether `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, the set `st` includes all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.**
