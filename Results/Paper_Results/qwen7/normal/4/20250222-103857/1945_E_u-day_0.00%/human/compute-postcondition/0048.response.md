Postcondition: **The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, `low`, `high`, and `mid` will be such that `low + 1` is not less than `high`. The set `st` will include all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range. `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
