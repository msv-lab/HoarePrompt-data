Output State: **`low` is an integer, `high` is an integer, and `low + 1 < high`; `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`, `high` is equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `high` is now `(low + high) // 2`, while `low` and `high` still maintain the condition `low + 1 < high`. The set `st` still contains the value of `mid`.
