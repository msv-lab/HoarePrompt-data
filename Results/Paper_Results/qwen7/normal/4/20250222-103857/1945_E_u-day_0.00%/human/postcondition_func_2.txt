The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n. It performs a binary search on the sorted list `arr` to find the position of `k`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by the positions of `low` and `pos` in the list. The function returns nothing.
