You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, and p is a list of n integers representing a permutation of size n.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers split from the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each integer to a string, and returns a map object containing these integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, each test case consists of n and x where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_1(), which is not defined in the given information.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by `func_1()`. The nature of the operations performed by `func_1()` are not specified in the given information.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (i.e., `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), `pos` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found in `arr`, or it will remain `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.

            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, the final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`. The set `st` will contain all the unique values of `mid` that were computed during each iteration of the loop. 
    #
    #The exact values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `arr` and `k`, but they will be such that `low + 1` is not less than `high`. The set `st` will include all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :

        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the value of high and pos is the position related to low or high)
    #State: The loop continues to execute until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, the final values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` will depend on the distribution of `k` within the sorted list `arr`. The set `st` will contain all the unique values of `mid` that were computed during each iteration of the loop. Whether `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, the set `st` includes all the midpoints calculated during the iterations, which are the points where the binary search process narrowed down the range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n. It performs a binary search on the sorted list `arr` to find the position of `k`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1 followed by the positions of `low` and `pos` in the list. The function returns nothing.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the binary search algorithm in the program does not ensure that the element `p_l` is equal to `x` after the algorithm completes. Instead, the program attempts to find the position of `x` in the array using a modified binary search approach, but it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the algorithm ends.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the array. If `x` is not in the array, the program will not perform any swaps and will incorrectly conclude that `x` is not present. This violates the requirement that the program should rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 2
  1 3 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  1 3
  ```

However, the provided program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program does not perform any swaps and incorrectly concludes that `x` is not present in the array. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
