Output State: **`low` is an integer, `high` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is now `(low + high) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The value of `low` remains unchanged, and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The set `st` still contains the value of `mid`.
