### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation array using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the modified array finds the target value `x` at the first position (`p_l`).

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly in terms of its logic. However, it's important to note that the algorithm is not applied to the permutation directly but rather to the modified permutation.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_3` attempts to find the index `pos` where `arr[pos] == k`.
   - It then performs a binary search-like operation to identify the correct position `low` where the target `k` should be placed.
   - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, no swaps are needed, and the function prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and swaps the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

4. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The function `func_3` does not actually modify the array `arr` to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. Instead, it just prints the number of operations and the positions to swap without changing the array.
   - The binary search-like operation is not necessary because the problem guarantees that 2 operations are always sufficient. This means we don't need to perform the binary search-like operation to find the exact position; we only need to place `k` in the correct position.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to find the position of `k` in the array.
   - If `k` is already at the first position, no swaps are needed.
   - If `k` is not at the first position, we need to swap it with either the first element or another element to make sure `p_l` is `k`.

### Corrected Solution:

The original assessment suggested that the code is incorrect because it does not modify the array to meet the requirement. However, upon closer inspection, the original code does attempt to find the correct position of `k` and prints the necessary swaps. The issue lies in the implementation of the binary search-like operation, which is unnecessary and complicates the solution.

Here is a simplified and corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break
    if pos == 0:
        print(0)
    elif pos == 1:
        print(1)
        print(1, 2)
    else:
        print(2)
        print(1, pos + 1)
        print(pos, pos + 1)

# Example usage
func_3()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- Find the position of `k` in the array.
- If `k` is already at the first position, no swaps are needed.
- If `k` is at the second position, swap the first and second elements.
- If `k` is at any other position, first swap `k` with the first element, then swap the first and second elements to ensure `p_l` is `k`.

### Conclusion:
The original code, despite its unnecessary binary search-like operation, does attempt to find the correct position of `k` and print the necessary swaps. Therefore, the original assessment was slightly off in its criticism of the binary search-like operation being unnecessary, but the overall approach is correct.
