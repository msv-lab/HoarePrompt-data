The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low + 1 < high`.

Right before the loop:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n - 1`
- `n` is greater than 0

For the loop `while low + 1 < high` to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.

Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, and knowing that `n` is greater than 0, the condition `low + 1 < high` simplifies to `1 < n - 1` or `n > 2`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, and `pos` is set to the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an index exists; otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged; `st` is an empty set.**
