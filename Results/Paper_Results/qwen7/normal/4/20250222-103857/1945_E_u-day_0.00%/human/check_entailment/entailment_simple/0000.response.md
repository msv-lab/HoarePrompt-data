Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a way to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search can find the target value \(x\) correctly.
2. The annotated program does not actually implement the logic to find the correct positions for the swaps. Instead, it uses a binary search approach directly on the unsorted permutation, which is incorrect because binary search requires a sorted array.
3. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used correctly in the context of solving the problem. `func_1` returns a map object, which should be converted to a list, and `func_2` is supposed to convert the map object to a list, but it's not defined properly.
4. The function `func_3` does not implement the required logic to find the correct swaps. It performs a binary search on the unsorted permutation, which is not valid for the problem statement.

Given these points, the provided code does not solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
