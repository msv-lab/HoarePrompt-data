Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `low + 1 < high`. After all iterations, `low` will be the floor value of `high` since they converge. The variable `high` will be the smallest integer greater than `low` where `arr[mid] <= k`, or it could be `n` if no such `mid` is found. The variable `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated before the condition `low + 1 >= high` is met. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the loop iterations. The values of `n`, `arr`, `i`, `k`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `low` and `high` will be very close to each other, with `low` being the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k` and `high` being the smallest index greater than `low` where `arr[high] > k` (or `n` if no such index exists). The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the search process.
