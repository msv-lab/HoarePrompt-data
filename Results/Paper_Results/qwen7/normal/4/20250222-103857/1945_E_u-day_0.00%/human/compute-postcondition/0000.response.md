Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` are the results of the function `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the return values of the function `func_1()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since `func_1()` is not defined here, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `k`, but we know they are the outputs of this function call. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n remains valid, but now these conditions are met through the return values of `func_1()`.
