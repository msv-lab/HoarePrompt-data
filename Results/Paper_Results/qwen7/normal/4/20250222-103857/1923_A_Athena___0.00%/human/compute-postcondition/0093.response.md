Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have had all its leading zeros removed. Since the loop continues to run as long as the last element of `a` is 0, once the last 0 is removed, the loop will terminate. At this point, `a` will no longer end with any 0s, but it will still be a non-empty list (since the initial state required `a` to be non-empty). The variable `res` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The variables `t` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
