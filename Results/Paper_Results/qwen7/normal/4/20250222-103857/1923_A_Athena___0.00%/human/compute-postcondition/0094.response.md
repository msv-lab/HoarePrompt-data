Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is 0.
- `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.

After the loop has executed, the list `a` will have had all its trailing zeros removed. The variable `res` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The variables `t` and `n` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` after all trailing zeros have been removed.

Output: **[non-empty list without trailing zeros]**
