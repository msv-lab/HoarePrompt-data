Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of n integers a (each either 0 or 1). It returns information about the state of each cell in the list a, indicating whether a cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). If at least one cell contains a chip, it processes each test case accordingly.**
