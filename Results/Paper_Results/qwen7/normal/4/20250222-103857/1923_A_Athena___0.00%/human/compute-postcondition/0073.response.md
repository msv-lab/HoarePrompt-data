Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element.
- `a` is a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element.

When the `print(res)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `res`, which is the count of zeros in the original list starting from the second element.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element)**
