Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program does not account for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips form a single block. Instead, it simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not guarantee the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the process of moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left until no more moves can be made, and count the number of moves performed.
