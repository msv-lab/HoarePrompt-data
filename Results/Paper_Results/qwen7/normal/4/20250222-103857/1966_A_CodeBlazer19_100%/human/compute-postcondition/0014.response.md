Output: **k - 1 (where k is the input integer converted to an integer)**

Explanation:
- `t` must be greater than 0, but it is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly set to 2, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, and it is used in the print statement.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement `print(k - 1)` will output `k - 1`, where `k` is the input integer converted to an integer.
