Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100; the list of integers c contains n integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each c_i in c.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
    if max(p) >= k:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the maximum value in `p` remains unchanged. If the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`, the maximum value in `p` remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer converted to an integer, `k` is an input integer converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`, and `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input split, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
