Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case, and the list of integers `c`.

2. **Counting Unique Elements**: The program creates a list `p` where each element is the count of each unique integer in the list `l`. This is done using a list comprehension with `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input into integers and `set(l)` to get unique elements.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the maximum count in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When the maximum count of any unique element is greater than or equal to `k`, the solution correctly outputs `k - 1`. This is because we can always reduce the count of that element by `k` until it is less than `k`, and we can do this repeatedly until only `k - 1` cards remain.
   - When the maximum count of any unique element is less than `k`, the solution correctly outputs `n`. This means we cannot perform any exchanges, and thus, the number of cards remains `n`.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in the program accurately reflects the rules and constraints of the problem. The program handles all edge cases appropriately and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
