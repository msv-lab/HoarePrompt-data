Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three components: an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500), a list of integers `c` containing `n` integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each c_i in c), and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. However, since the function definition does not include these parameters directly, it implies they might be passed in a different manner, such as through global variables or other function calls. The function then processes these inputs to produce a specific output for each test case.
