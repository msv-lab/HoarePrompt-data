Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `k` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l` (not directly involved in the loop).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`.**
