State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range(t)` function, so at the start of the first iteration, `i` should be set to 1.
3. The initial value of `t` (the number of test cases) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at all.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1.
