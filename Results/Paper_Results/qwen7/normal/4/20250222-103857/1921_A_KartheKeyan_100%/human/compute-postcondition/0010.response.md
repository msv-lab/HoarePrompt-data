Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(x, y)`. After appending another tuple `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two tuples: `[(x, y), (x, y)]`. The values of `res`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
