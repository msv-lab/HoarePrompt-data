You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: Output State: `n` is 0, `total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples sorted by their first elements, each tuple representing the (x, y) coordinates provided as input, `i` is 3, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `p1` is (input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)², `p2` is ((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²), `res` is sqrt((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²) * sqrt(((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²)).
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be decremented to 0 since it starts at a value greater than 0 and is decreased by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `total` is not mentioned in the loop body or head, so it remains 0. The variable `coord` will contain the coordinates provided as input, sorted by their first elements, after all iterations. The variable `i` will be 3 because the for loop runs 4 times for each iteration of the while loop. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last set of coordinates provided as input, and `p1` and `p2` will be calculated based on these last coordinates. The variable `res` will be the final result printed after the last iteration, which is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
