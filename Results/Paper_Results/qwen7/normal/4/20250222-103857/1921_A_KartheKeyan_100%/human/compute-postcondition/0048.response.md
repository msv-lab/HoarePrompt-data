Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is 3
   - `coord` is [(x, y)]
   - `x` is an integer from input
   - `y` is an integer from input
   - `p1` is 0
   - `res` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to 3 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < 4`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged at 3.

5. **List the updated states**:
   - `total` remains 0
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` is still 3
   - `coord` remains [(x, y)]
   - `x` remains an integer from input
   - `y` remains an integer from input
   - `p1` remains 0
   - `res` remains 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(x, y)], `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is 0, `res` is 0**
