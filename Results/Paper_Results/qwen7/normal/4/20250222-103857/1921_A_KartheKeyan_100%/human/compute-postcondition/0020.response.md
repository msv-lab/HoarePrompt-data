Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`:**
   - We need to know the values of `p1` and `p2` to determine `res`.

2. **`n` must be non-zero:**
   - This condition is given but does not affect the calculation of `res`.

3. **`coord` contains four tuples of coordinates sorted by the first element:**
   - Let's assume the coordinates are represented as tuples `(x, y)`. For simplicity, let's denote them as follows:
     - First point: `(x1, y1)`
     - Second point: `(x2, y2)`
     - Third point: `(x3, y3)`
     - Fourth point: `(x4, y4)`
   - Since `coord` is sorted by the first element, we can assume:
     - `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, `(x4, y4)` where \(x1 \leq x2 \leq x3 \leq x4\).

4. **`i` is 3:**
   - This is just an index and doesn't directly affect the calculation of `res`.

5. **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer:**
   - These are placeholders for any integer values but do not affect the calculation of `res`.

6. **`p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`:**
   - \(p1 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2\)

7. **`p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`:**
   - \(p2 = (x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2\)

Given these details, we can express `res` as:
\[ res = \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2} = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2} \times \sqrt{(x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2} \]

Since the exact coordinates are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, the print statement will round this value to the nearest integer.

Output: **round(sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) * sqrt((x4 - x3)^2 + (y4 - y3)^2))**
