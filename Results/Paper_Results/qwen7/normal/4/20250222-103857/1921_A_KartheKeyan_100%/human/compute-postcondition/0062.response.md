Output State: `n` is 0, `total` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of coordinates sorted by their first elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `p1` is (last input integer - `x`)² + (last input integer - `y`)², `res` is sqrt((last input integer - `x`)² + (last input integer - `y`)²) * sqrt(((last input integer - `x`)² + (last input integer - `y`)²)).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be decremented to 0 since it starts at a value that allows the loop to run until it reaches 0. The variable `total` is not mentioned in the loop and remains 0. The `coord` list will contain the coordinates entered in the last iteration of the loop, as each iteration overwrites the `coord` list with new inputs. The variable `i` is set to 3 within the loop and does not change during each iteration. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the last input values provided by the user, and `p1` and `res` will be calculated based on these last input values.
