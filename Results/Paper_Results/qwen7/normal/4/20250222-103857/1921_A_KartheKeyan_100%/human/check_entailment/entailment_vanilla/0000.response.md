### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the coordinates are provided in no particular order.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting is unnecessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distance between two adjacent points (which should be the side length of the square) and multiplies these distances to get the area.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The key part of the code is calculating the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be found by calculating the Euclidean distance between any two adjacent points.
   - The code calculates the squared distance between two adjacent points and then takes the square root to get the side length.
   - However, the code incorrectly calculates the distances. It should only consider the differences in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates directly, as the distances between points along the same axis will give the side length of the square.
   - The current implementation calculates the squared distance between two points and then takes the square root twice, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct approach would be to find the maximum difference in x-coordinates and the maximum difference in y-coordinates, and then use the larger of these two values as the side length of the square.
   - The area would then be the side length squared.

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it unnecessarily calculates the squared distance and takes the square root twice. A simpler and more direct approach is needed.

### Correctness:
**False**
