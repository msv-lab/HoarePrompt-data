Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer)], `p1` is 0, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `coord`, `p1`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, `total` is still 0, `i` is still 2, `n` is still 3, `coord` remains as a list containing tuples with `x` and `y`, and `p1` and `res` are both 0. The values of `x` and `y` are the integers entered by the user.
