You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of square coordinates provided as input. For each set of coordinates, it calculates the side length of the square and prints the product of the square roots of the distances between the first and second corner and the third and fourth corner. After processing all sets of coordinates, the function ensures that the loop counter `n` is decremented to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the area of the square by sorting the coordinates and then calculating the distances between certain points. However, the logic for determining the side length of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between the first two points and the last two points, which may not necessarily correspond to the side length of the square.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
-1 1
1 1
-1 -1
1 -1
-1 1
1 1
11 11
1 11
11 1
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
4
4
```

However, the program will output incorrect results because it incorrectly calculates the distances. For example, in the first test case, the program will calculate the distance between (1, 1) and (-1, -1), which is not the side length of the square. The correct approach would be to ensure that the calculated distances represent the side length of the square.

A correct solution would involve identifying the unique pairs of points that form the sides of the square and ensuring that the distances between these points are equal.
