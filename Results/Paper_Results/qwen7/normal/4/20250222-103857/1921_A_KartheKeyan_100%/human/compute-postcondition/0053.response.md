Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer), (`x`, `y`)], `p1` is 0, `res` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples: `(`x`, `y`)` and `(input integer, input integer)`. After executing the code, the list `coord` will have three elements: `(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer), (`x`, `y`). All other variables remain unchanged.
