Output State: **`res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` contains four tuples of coordinates sorted by the first element, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.**

The code calculates `res` as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. However, the specific values of `p1` and `p2` depend on the coordinates in `coord`, which are not provided. Therefore, `res` is expressed as the mathematical operation involving `p1` and `p2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
