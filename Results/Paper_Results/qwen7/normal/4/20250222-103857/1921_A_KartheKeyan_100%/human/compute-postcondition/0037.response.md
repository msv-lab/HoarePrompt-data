Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 4, `coord` is a list containing four tuples sorted by their first elements, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])² + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])².**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in the `coord` list. Since `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted by their first elements, `coord[0]` and `coord[1]` represent the first and second points respectively. The values of `total`, `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `coord` remain unchanged. The value of `p1` is updated to the calculated squared Euclidean distance.
