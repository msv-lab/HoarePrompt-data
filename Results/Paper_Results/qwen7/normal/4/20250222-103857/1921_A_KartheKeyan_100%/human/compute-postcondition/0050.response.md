Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer)], `p1` is 0, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are obtained from input, they are now part of the list `coord`. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `p1`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `coord` now contains two tuples, each representing the coordinates `(x, y)` and the new input `(input integer, input integer)`.
