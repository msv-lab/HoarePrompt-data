Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `n` is 4.
   - `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted by their first elements.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` and `y` are integers from input (their values are unknown but will be used in the calculation).
   - `p1` is calculated as `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(round(res))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted by their first elements. Let's denote these tuples as `(a1, b1)`, `(a2, b2)`, `(a3, b3)`, and `(a4, b4)` where `a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= a4`.
- `i` is 3, so `i` refers to the last tuple in the list, which is `(a4, b4)`.
- `p1` is calculated as `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, which means `p1 = a2 - a1`.

However, the variable `res` is not defined in the initial state, and there is no code provided that defines or calculates `res`. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `res` based on the given information.

Given the lack of definition for `res`, we cannot accurately determine what will be printed. 

Output: **round(res)** (where `res` is an undefined variable)
