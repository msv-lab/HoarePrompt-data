Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input `n`.
   - In `func_1()`, it reads the value of `n` and calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed.
   - It then performs the operations as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Checking the Calculation**:
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
   - This formula seems to be derived from the properties of permutations and the structure of the matrix, but let's verify if it matches the problem requirements.

4. **Verifying the Operations**:
   - The program prints two operations for each row (or column) of the matrix, setting each element to a permutation of the indices from \( n \) down to 1.
   - This approach ensures that each element in the matrix will eventually be set to a value from 1 to \( n \), maximizing the sum.

5. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is indeed correct for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The operations performed ensure that each element is set to a unique value from 1 to \( n \), achieving the maximum possible sum.
   - The number of operations used is \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
