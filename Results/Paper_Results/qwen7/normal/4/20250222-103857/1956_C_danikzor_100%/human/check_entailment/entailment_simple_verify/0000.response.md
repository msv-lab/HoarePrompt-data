### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - Prints the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations required (`2n`).
   - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs two operations:
     - A Type 1 operation where `a_{i, j}` is assigned the values from `n` down to `1` (i.e., `p_j = n, n-1, ..., 1`).
     - A Type 2 operation where `a_{j, i}` is assigned the same values as above.

3. **Output:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.
   - The sum calculated is indeed the maximum possible sum for the given operations, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\).
   - The number of operations performed is `2n`.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
  - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\).

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - After reading `n`, it prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
  - It then performs `2n` operations, each setting the values in the matrix according to the specified permutations.

- **Operations:**
  - Each row `i` is processed twice: once for Type 1 operation and once for Type 2 operation.
  - This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to a value that contributes to the maximum sum.

#### Example Verification:

- For \(n = 2\):
  - Initial matrix: \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).
  - Operations:
    - Type 1: Set row 1 to \([2, 1]\).
    - Type 2: Set column 1 to \([2, 1]\).
    - Type 1: Set row 2 to \([2, 1]\).
    - Type 2: Set column 2 to \([2, 1]\).
  - Resulting matrix: \(\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\).
  - Sum: \(2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6\).

- For \(n = 3\):
  - Initial matrix: \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\).
  - Operations:
    - Type 1: Set row 1 to \([3, 2, 1]\).
    - Type 2: Set column 1 to \([3, 2, 1]\).
    - Type 1: Set row 2 to \([3, 2, 1]\).
    - Type 2: Set column 2 to \([3, 2, 1]\).
    - Type 1: Set row 3 to \([3, 2, 1]\).
    - Type 2: Set column 3 to \([3, 2, 1]\).
  - Resulting matrix: \(\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\).
  - Sum: \(3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 18\).

These examples show that the program correctly sets the matrix to achieve the maximum possible sum and performs exactly `2n` operations.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it does not perform meaningful operations on the matrix. However, upon careful analysis, the program does indeed perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum and meets the problem requirements.

**Final: True**
