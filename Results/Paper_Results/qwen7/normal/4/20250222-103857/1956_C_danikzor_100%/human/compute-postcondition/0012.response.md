Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, with `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, `i` will take on the value of the current iteration number, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to complete all its iterations.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` can be any integer from 3 up to 500 (as per the initial constraints).
