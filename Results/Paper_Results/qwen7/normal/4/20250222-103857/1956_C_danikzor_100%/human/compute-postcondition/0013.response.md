Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case has an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. For each test case, the function processes t and n and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing integers t and n within specified ranges. It processes these values and returns a result for each test case, ensuring the total complexity based on n² does not exceed a given limit.
