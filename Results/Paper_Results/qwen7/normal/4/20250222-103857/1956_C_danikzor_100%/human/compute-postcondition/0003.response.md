Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The first argument `1` is directly printed.
2. The variable `i` is also directly printed. Since `i` is explicitly given as 1, it will be printed as `1`.
3. The `*range(n, 0, -1)` part will generate a range of numbers from `n` down to `1` (exclusive), decrementing by `-1`.

Since `n` must be at least 1, let's consider the minimum case where `n` is 1:
- If `n` is 1, `range(1, 0, -1)` will generate an empty sequence because the start value (1) is not less than the stop value (0).

Therefore, the `*range(n, 0, -1)` part will print nothing if `n` is 1.

Output: **1 1**
