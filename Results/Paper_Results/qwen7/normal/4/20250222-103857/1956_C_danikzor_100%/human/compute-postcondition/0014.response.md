Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and calculates two values: `(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6)` and `2 * n`. It then prints these values followed by executing a loop that prints two sets of output for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. After completing all iterations, the function concludes with `i` equal to `n` and `n` within the range of 3 to 500.**
