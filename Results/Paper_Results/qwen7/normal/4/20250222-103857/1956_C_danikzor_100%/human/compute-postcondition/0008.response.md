Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 1

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` is currently 2, it will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the range defined by `n`. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above conditions, we need to update the state to reflect the next possible values for `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
