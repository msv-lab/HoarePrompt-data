Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is not relevant to the problem and does not represent the maximum possible sum of the matrix. Additionally, the program always prints `2 * n` operations, which is not necessarily the minimum number of operations required to achieve the maximum sum. The logic inside `func_1()` also incorrectly uses the same permutation for both types of operations, which does not maximize the sum of the matrix according to the problem statement.
