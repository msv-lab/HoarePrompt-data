You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: (n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, with `i` ranging from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, `i` will take on the value of the current iteration number, and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to complete all its iterations.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` can be any integer from 3 up to 500 (as per the initial constraints).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case has an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. For each test case, the function processes t and n and returns a result based on these values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
