Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `1 <= i < n + 1` must be satisfied.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain at least 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` must be 2
   - `n` must be at least 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
