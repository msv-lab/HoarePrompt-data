Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, `num1` is the first element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, and either the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, or nothing changes if the length of `nums` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `num1 = int(nums[0])` simply assigns the first element of the list `nums`, which is already converted to an integer, to the variable `num1`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `num2`, `numbers`, or whether the program breaks out of a loop or if statement. The precondition that the length of `nums` is 2 remains unchanged.
