Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `nums`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `numbers`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
