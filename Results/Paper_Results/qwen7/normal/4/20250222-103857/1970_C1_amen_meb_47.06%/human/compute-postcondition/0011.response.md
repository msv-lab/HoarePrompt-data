The `while True` loop does not have any condition to exit, meaning the loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped. Since there are no conditions in the loop head that determine whether the loop should continue, no adjustments to the states are necessary based solely on the loop head.

However, to ensure the loop can proceed to the next iteration, we can assume that the loop body might modify some variables, but since those modifications are not specified, we cannot infer any changes. Therefore, we should keep the current state as it is.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer**
