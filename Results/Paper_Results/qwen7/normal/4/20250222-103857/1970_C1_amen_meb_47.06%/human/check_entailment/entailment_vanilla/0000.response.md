Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function reads pairs of integers from the standard input until a non-pair line is encountered.
   - It stores these pairs in a list called `numbers`.
   - However, the problem statement mentions that the input format is fixed and does not involve reading pairs from the standard input. Instead, it provides the edges directly in the code as part of the problem setup.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program initializes `Ron_co` and `Hib_co` to count the number of times Ron and Hermione win, respectively.
   - It iterates over the `result` list, which should be the edges of the tree.
   - For each pair `[num_1, num_2]`, it checks which number is larger:
     - If `num_1` is greater than `num_2`, it increments `Ron_co`.
     - If `num_1` is equal to `num_2`, it skips the iteration.
     - Otherwise, it increments `Hib_co`.
   - After processing all pairs, it compares `Ron_co` and `Hib_co` to decide the winner.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1()` is not used in the main logic. The main program directly uses the edges provided in the problem setup, so `func_1()` is redundant and unnecessary.
   - The main logic incorrectly assumes that the input is a list of pairs from standard input, which contradicts the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic for counting wins (`Ron_co` and `Hib_co`) is based on comparing the numbers in the edges, which is not relevant to determining the winner of the game.
   - The game involves optimal moves on a tree structure, and the logic provided does not reflect the actual game rules.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
