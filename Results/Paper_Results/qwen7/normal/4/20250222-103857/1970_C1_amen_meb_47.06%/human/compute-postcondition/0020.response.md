Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list `nums` is created from the input split by spaces, the first element of `nums` is converted to an integer and assigned to `num1`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, `num2` is the second element of `nums` converted to an integer, `numbers` is a list containing `[num1, num2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditionals specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the program will exit the context where the `break` statement is placed, which is typically within a loop or conditional structure. However, since no such structure is present in the given code, the variables remain unchanged, and the program simply continues to execute after the `break` statement. Therefore, the output state includes all the preconditions that were initially set and mentions that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside, which in this case does not exist.
