Output State: **`index` is 21, `q` is 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[18]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[19]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is `['YES']` if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` has `'NO'` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
