Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `results` is 'NO' because the value of `v1` does not change and `it1` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code appends 'NO' to the `results` list. Since `results` was already 'NO', appending 'NO' again doesn't change its value. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in this snippet.
