Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`**

Explanation: The code only updates the value of `it2`. It calculates `it2` as the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. Since `v2` was previously set to `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, this calculation does not change the value of `it2` from its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states described in the precondition.
