Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 6]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is `['NO', 'YES']`.**

Explanation: The code appends `'YES'` to the `results` list. Initially, `results` was either `['NO', 'YES']` or `['NO', 'NO']` depending on the condition. After appending `'YES'`, `results` becomes `['NO', 'YES']`. All other variables remain unchanged.
