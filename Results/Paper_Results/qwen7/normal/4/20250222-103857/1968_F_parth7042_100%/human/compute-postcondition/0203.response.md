Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` equals 0, `results` is appended with 'NO'**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending 'NO', it now contains 'NO'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
