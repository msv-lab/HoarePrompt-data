Output State: **`index` is 2; `t` is an integer extracted from `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `index` or `t`. Therefore, `index` remains 2 and `t` remains as an integer extracted from `data[0]`. The new variable `results` is created and is an empty list.
