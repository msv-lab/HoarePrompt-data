Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` equals 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of bisect_left(v1, l), `it2` is the result of bisect_left(v2, r) - 1, and either `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1` or `it2` is less than 0 or the value at `v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to the value at `v2[it2]`**
