The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is given, we assume this is within a loop structure. The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. It simply continues the loop process.

The variables `results`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated, but since `continue` does not affect their values, they remain as they were before the statement. The `results` list has already had `'YES'` appended to it, so it will continue to contain `'YES'`.

Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `results` contains 'YES', and the loop continues.**
