Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `results` is 'NO' because the value of `v1` does not change and `it1` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` simply assigns the value of `bisect_left(v1, l)` to `it1`. Since `v1` and `l` remain unchanged from their previous values, `it1` will also remain the same. All other variables and their relationships to each other are unchanged by this line of code.
