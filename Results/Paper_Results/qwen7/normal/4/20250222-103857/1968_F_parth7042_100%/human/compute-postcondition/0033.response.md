Output State: **`index` is 12, `q` is 4, `a[12]` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `mp[pf[12]]` is appended with `12`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`**

Explanation: The code `r = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` (which is `data[13]` since `index` is 12) to `r` after converting it to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
