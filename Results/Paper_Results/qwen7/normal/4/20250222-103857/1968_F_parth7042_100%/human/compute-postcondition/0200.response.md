The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending 'YES', `results` will contain ['YES']. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` equals 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is ['YES'].**
