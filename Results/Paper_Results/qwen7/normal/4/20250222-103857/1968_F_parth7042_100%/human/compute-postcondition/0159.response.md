Postcondition: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 8, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, and `results` is either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` holds true in the if part or `results` remains 'NO' as no append operation occurs in the else part.**
