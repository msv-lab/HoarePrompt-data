Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a[i]` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `index` is `3 + n + 4` (which is `n + 7`), `pf[i]` is calculated as the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a` up to `i`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` matches the key.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all iterations:
- The list `a` will contain integers read from `data` starting from `index`.
- The variable `index` will be `n + 7`.
- The list `pf` will store the cumulative XOR of the elements of `a` up to each index.
- The dictionary-like structure `mp` will map each unique value of `pf[i]` to a list of all indices `i` where `pf[i]` has that value.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 2]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` equals 0, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` is `['YES']`; otherwise, `results` is `['NO']`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `index` is `data[index + 4]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `results` is either `['NO', 'YES']` or `['NO', 'NO']` depending on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 6]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` and now `it2` is recalculated to be `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` is `['YES']`. Otherwise, `results` is `['NO']`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
