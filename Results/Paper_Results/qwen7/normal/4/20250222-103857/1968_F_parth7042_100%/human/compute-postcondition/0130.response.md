Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 1, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` are true, `results` is ['YES']; otherwise, `results` is ['NO']**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. All other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
