The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` (which is typically an underscore indicating a throwaway variable) and `t`. Since the underscore is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `t` has been decremented to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is set to 1 (or any positive integer greater than 0).

State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is `x + n + 1`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration, and `t` is 1**.
