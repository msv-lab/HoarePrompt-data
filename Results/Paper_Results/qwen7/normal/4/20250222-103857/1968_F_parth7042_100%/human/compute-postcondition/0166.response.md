Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `index` is now `x + n + 4`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are unchanged, and `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `pf` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the length of list `a`, the value of `index`, the contents of `results`, and the values of `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
