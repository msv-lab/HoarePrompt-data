Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `index` is `x + 2`, `pf[3]` remains the same (`pf[2] ^ a[3]`), `mp[pf[3]]` still includes the value 3, `a[i]` is an integer from `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was equal to `x + 1`. After executing the code, `index` becomes `x + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
