Output State: **`index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is 0, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and either `it1` is not less than `len(v1)`, or `it2` is less than 0, or `v1[it1]` is greater than or equal to `v2[it2]`; `results` list now contains 'NO'**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The conditions involving `it1`, `it2`, `v1`, `v2`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
