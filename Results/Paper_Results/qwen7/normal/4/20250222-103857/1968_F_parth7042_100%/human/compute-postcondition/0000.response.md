Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, n` and `q` are integers extracted from the input string, `a` is a list of n integers, and each query is a pair of integers `l` and `r` where 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The initial values of `n` and `q` are part of the input that will be split into separate elements in the `data` list. The list `a` and the queries are not defined yet but will be initialized later based on the values in `data`.
