Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes integers `n` and `q`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. For each query defined by integers `l` and `r`, it determines whether the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r-1` equals zero. If so, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, it prints the results as a list of 'YES' and 'NO' strings.**
