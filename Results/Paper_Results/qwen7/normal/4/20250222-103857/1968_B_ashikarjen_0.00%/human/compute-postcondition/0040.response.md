Output State: **`j` is less than `m` and `b[j + 1]` is not equal to `a[m + 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing `j` to `j + 1`. The condition `b[j] is not equal to a[m + 1]` remains true because `j` was originally less than `m` and the inequality involving `b[j]` and `a[m + 1]` still holds after incrementing `j`. Therefore, the new condition is `b[j + 1] is not equal to a[m + 1]`.
