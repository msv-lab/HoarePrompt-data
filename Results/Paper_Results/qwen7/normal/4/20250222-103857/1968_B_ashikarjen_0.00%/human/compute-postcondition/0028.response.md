Output State: **`j` is equal to `j` + 1, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` when `j` is within the valid range (i.e., `0 <= j < m`).**

The variable `j` is incremented by 1, while all other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
