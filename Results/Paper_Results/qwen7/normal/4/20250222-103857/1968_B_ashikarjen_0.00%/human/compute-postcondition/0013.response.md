Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 3, `b[3]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `j` will be equal to `m`. The loop continues to increment `j` as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Once `j` reaches `m` or `b[j]` becomes equal to `a[i]`, the loop terminates. Given that the loop executed at least 3 times, `m` must be greater than 3, and `b[3]` must not be equal to `a[i]` for the loop to continue iterating.
