Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that both parts of the condition are met for the next iteration of the loop.

   - The first part of the condition is `j < m`.
   - The second part of the condition is `b[j] != a[i]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `m` + 1.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - For every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `j` is currently `m` + 1, the condition `j < m` is false. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`.
   - Since `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]` and `j` is currently `m` + 1, `b[j]` is not relevant for the current condition check because `j` is out of bounds. However, for the loop to continue, `b[j]` should not be equal to `a[i]` when `j` is within bounds.

Given these points, we need to adjust `j` to be less than `m` and ensure that `b[j]` does not equal `a[i]` when `j` is within the valid range.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be less than `m`.
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` when `j` is within the valid range (i.e., `0 <= j < m`).

State: **`j` must be less than `m`, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` when `j` is within the valid range (i.e., `0 <= j < m`)**
