Output State: **`j` is equal to `m + 1`, `m` is greater than 0, and the condition `j < m` is false; variable `k` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, making it equal to `m + 1`. Since `j` was originally equal to `m`, and now `j` is `m + 1`, the condition `j < m` is no longer true. The value of `m` remains greater than 0, and `k` is increased by 1, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state, so we only note that it has been incremented.
