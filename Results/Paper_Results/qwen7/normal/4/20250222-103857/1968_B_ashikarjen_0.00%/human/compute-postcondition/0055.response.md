Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) for `t` times. Additionally, for each test case, it receives two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function returns nothing directly but processes and handles these inputs according to specified conditions.**
