Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will eventually reach or exceed `m`. This is because the loop continues as long as `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`. Since `i` is fixed at `n` and does not change, once `j` equals `m`, the condition `j < m` becomes false, and the loop terminates. At this point, `j` will be exactly `m` (or more, but the exact value is `m` since it stops right before `j` reaches `m` again), and no further changes to `b` or `a` occur inside the loop. Therefore, the condition that for every index `i` ranging from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]` remains true, and `i` is still `n`.
