Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `j < m`: This checks if `j` is less than `m`.
   - `b[j] != a[i]`: This checks if the element at index `j` in array `b` is not equal to the element at index `i` in array `a`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both parts of the condition must be true.
   - `j < m`: Since `j` is initially equal to `m` (as given in the state), this part of the condition is false. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`.
   - `b[j] != a[i]`: This part depends on the values of `b[j]` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is `m + 1` (as given in the state), and for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, we know that `b[m]` (which corresponds to `b[j]` when `j = m`) should not be equal to `a[m + 1]`.

4. **Combine the necessary adjustments**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` must be less than `m`.
- `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Since `i` is `m + 1`, the condition `b[j] != a[i]` translates to `b[j] != a[m + 1]`.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[m + 1]`**
