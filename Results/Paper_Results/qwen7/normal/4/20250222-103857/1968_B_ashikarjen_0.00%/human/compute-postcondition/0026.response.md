Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` + 1, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `n`, and `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now equal to `m` + 1. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
