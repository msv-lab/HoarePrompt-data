Output State: **`j` is equal to `m` + 1, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `m`; `k` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is equal to `m`, after executing `j += 1`, `j` becomes `m + 1`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
