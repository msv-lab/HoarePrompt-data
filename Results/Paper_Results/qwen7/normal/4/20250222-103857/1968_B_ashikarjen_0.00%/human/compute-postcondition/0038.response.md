Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `m` (since `j` is equal to `m` and `j` is increased by 1 if `j < m`).
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - For every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.
   - `i` is `n`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `m` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `m + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `m + 1`.**
