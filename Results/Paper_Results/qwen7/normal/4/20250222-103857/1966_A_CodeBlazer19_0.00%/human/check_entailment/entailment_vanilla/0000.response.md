Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program then prints `k - 1` without performing any operations or processing the list of card numbers.
   - This means the program does not take into account the actual distribution of card numbers or any potential operations that could reduce the number of cards.

3. **Example Cases**:
   - Consider the first example case: `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`. The expected output is `2`, but the program would output `2 - 1 = 1`.
   - Consider the second example case: `1 10 7`. The expected output is `1`, but the program would output `10 - 1 = 9`.
   - Consider the third example case: `7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`. The expected output is `1`, but the program would output `2 - 1 = 1`.

### Conclusion

The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. It simply subtracts 1 from `k` and prints the result, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
