Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `k` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (not directly involved in the loop).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 1**
