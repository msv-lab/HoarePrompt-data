Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
