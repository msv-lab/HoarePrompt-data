State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition `for i in range(t)` requires that `t` must be a non-negative integer.
2. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
3. Since `t` is obtained from `int(input())` and is guaranteed to be between 1 and 500 inclusive, we do not need to adjust `t` further.
4. The initial value of `i` is 0, as specified by the `range(t)` function, which generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including `t`.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `t` (to ensure it is within the specified range) and `i` (which starts at 0).
