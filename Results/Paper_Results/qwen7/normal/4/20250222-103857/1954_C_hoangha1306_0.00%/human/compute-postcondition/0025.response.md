Postcondition: `vt` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the value of `x`, and `kq2` is a string that either contains the value of `x` plus the string representation of `y` (if `a[i] > b[i]` for some index `i`) or is concatenated with the string representation of `x` (if `a[i] <= b[i]` for all indices `i`).
