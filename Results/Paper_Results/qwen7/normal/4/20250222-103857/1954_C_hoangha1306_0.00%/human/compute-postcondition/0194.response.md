Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is unchanged, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is `q + 1` and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**.

In natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is updated by adding the character `a[i]` to its current value, `kq2` remains unchanged, `vt` stays as 1 if it was 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the original input string, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
