Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is `q + 1` and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**.

This means that the variables `i`, `len(a)`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, `q`, `b`, `a`, `x`, and `y` retain their previous conditions except that `x` is now the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
