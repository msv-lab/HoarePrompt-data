Postcondition: **`i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are concatenated with `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is an input string, and `x` and `y` are integers representing the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` respectively.**
