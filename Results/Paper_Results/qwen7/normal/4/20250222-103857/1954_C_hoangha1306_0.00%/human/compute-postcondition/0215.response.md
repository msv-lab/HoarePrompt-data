Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the strings x and y represent the same integer when read from right to left (reversed).**

Given the constraints that `x` and `y` are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9, the function does not actually take any parameters. Instead, it compares the reversed versions of the strings `x` and `y` to determine if they represent the same integer. If they do, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
