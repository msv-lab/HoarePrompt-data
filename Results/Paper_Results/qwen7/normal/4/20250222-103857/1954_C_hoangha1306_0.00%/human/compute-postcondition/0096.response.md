Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. `a` is an input string, `kq1` is either the concatenation of `kq1` with the string representation of `x` or the character `y` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. `kq2` is either the concatenation of `kq2` with the string representation of `y` or the string `str(x)`. `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1, `b` is an input string, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`.**
