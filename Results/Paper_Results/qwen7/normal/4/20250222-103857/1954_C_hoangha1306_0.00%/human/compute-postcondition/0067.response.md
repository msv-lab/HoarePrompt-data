Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1`. `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise it is updated by appending the string representation of the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` to its current value. `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0. `i` is `n + 2`, where `n` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq2` is updated by adding the string representation of `a[i]` to its previous value. If `a[i] != b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the value of `vt`: if `vt == 0` and `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` (minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i]))` and `kq2` by appending the string representation of `y` (maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i]))`. If `vt == 0` and `a[i] <= b[i]`, `kq1` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` and `kq2` by appending the string representation of `x`. If `vt != 0`, `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to its current value.**
