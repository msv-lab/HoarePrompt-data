Output State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. They are still strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
