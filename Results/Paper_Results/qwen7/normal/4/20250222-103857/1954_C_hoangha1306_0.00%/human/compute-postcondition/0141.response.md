To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code step by step:

1. **`i` is equal to `len(a)`**: This means `i` is the length of the list `a`.

2. **`kq1` and `kq2`**:
   - `kq1` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters from `a` where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` or the minimum value of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
   - `kq2` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters from `a` where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` or the maximum value of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.

3. **`vt` is 1**: This is a constant value.

4. **`q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`**: This implies that `q` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1 from 0) and `q < t` is true.

5. **`b` is an input string**: This is a string provided as input.

Given these details, let's focus on the `print(kq2)` statement:

- Since `i` is the length of `a`, the condition `a[i]` does not apply because `i` is out of bounds (it refers to the last index of `a` plus one).
- Therefore, the concatenation for both `kq1` and `kq2` will be based on the entire list `a`.

So, `kq2` will be a string containing all characters from `a` where each character is either the same as in `b` or the maximum of the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` converted to integers.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact string. However, based on the structure of the problem, `kq2` will be constructed as described.

Output: **kq2 (where kq2 is a string containing all characters from `a` where each character is the maximum of the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` converted to integers)**
