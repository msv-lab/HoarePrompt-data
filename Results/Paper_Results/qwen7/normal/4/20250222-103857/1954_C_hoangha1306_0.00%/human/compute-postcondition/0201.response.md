Output State: **`vt` is 1, `kq1` is 'None' + str(x), `kq2` is an empty string plus str(y)**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(y)` adds the string representation of `y` to `kq2`. Since `kq2` was not defined before this line, it is assumed to be an empty string (`''`). Therefore, `kq2` becomes an empty string concatenated with `str(y)`, which is `str(y)`. The values of `vt` and `kq1` remain unchanged.
