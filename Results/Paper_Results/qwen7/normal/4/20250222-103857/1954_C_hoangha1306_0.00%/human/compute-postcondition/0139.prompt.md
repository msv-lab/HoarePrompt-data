Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input string, `kq1` is '', `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `q` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `b` is an input string
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is an integer, `a` is an input string, `kq1` is a string, `kq2` is a string, `vt` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `b` is an input string, and the following conditions hold:
- If `a[i] == b[i]` and `i` is 3, then `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the second character of `a`, `vt` is 0, and `q` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`:
  - If `vt == 0`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. `kq1` is updated based on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, and `kq2` is updated accordingly. `vt` is set to 1, and `q` is incremented by 1.
  - If `vt != 0`, then `i` is reset to 0. `kq1` and `kq2` are updated with the maximum and minimum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, respectively. `vt` remains 0, and `q` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are concatenated with `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is an input string, and `x` and `y` are integers representing the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is less than `len(a)` + 1, `kq1` is updated to include either the string representation of the minimum or the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` based on the if condition (`vt == 0`), or `str(y)`, `kq2` is updated to include either the string representation of the maximum or the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` based on the if condition (`vt == 0`), or `kq2 + str(x)`, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `vt` remains as 1 if the if condition is true, otherwise it is updated based on the else condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
