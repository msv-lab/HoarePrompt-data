Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise it is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value, `vt` is 1, `i` is `n + 2`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `x` to its current value.**

In this output state, `kq2` has been updated by appending the string representation of `x` (which is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`) to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
