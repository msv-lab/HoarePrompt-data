Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `x` and `y` based on the comparison of elements at each index, `kq2` is a string that either contains the string representation of `x` appended to itself or is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value based on the comparison of elements at each index, `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.
