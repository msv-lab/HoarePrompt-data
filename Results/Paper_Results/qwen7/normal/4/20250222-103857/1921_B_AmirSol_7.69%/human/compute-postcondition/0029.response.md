Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while i < n`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `counter` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - `i` is either 2 or 3.
   - `n` is greater than `i`.
   - If the else part is executed, `counter` is increased by 1.
   - If the if part is executed, `counter` remains either 2, 3, or 4, `i` remains either 3 or 4, and `n` remains greater than `i`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Given that `i` is either 2 or 3, and `n` is greater than `i`, the only way to ensure `i < n` in the next iteration is to ensure that `n` is greater than 3 (since `i` cannot decrease).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` can be either 2 or 3, and `n` must be greater than `i`, the minimum value `n` can take to ensure `i < n` is 4.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Final State**:
   - We don't need to change the values of `counter`, `i`, or `n` beyond ensuring that `n` is greater than 3 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

**Answer**:
State: **`counter` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
