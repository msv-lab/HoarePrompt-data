Output State: **`counter` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4; `i` is either 2 or 3; `n` must be greater than 3**

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, 2, 3, or 4, it becomes 2, 3, 4, or 5 respectively. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
