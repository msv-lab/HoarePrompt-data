Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). However, the logic within the `func_1` function is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function checks if `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]` and then tries to move cats around based on certain conditions. But the conditions used to decide whether to move a cat or not are incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and (s1[i] != s1[i + 1])` does not correctly represent the allowed operations. The operations allowed are moving a cat, adding a cat, or removing a cat, but the function does not correctly account for these operations.

2. **Counting Operations**: The function simply counts the number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, without considering the actual operations needed. For example, if `s1` is "010" and `s2` is "101", the function would incorrectly count 3 operations, but only 2 operations are actually needed: move the cat from the first box to the second, and move the cat from the second box to the third.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when a cat needs to be moved from one box to another directly without intermediate steps.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state.

Correctness: **False**
