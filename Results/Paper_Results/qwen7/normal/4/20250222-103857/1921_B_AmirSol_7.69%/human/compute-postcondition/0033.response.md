Output State: **`counter` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4; `i` is either 3 or 4; `n` must be greater than 3**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was either 2 or 3, after the increment, `i` will be either 3 or 4. The values of `counter` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
