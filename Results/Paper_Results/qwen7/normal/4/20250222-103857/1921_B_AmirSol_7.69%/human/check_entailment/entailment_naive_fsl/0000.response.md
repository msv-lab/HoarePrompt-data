Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. The logic in the `func_1` function does not account for all possible scenarios, particularly when there are multiple cats that need to be moved or removed.

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 4
s1 = "0101"
s2 = "1010"
```

Expected output: `2` (Move the cat from box 1 to box 2, and move the cat from box 3 to box 4).

However, the program will output `1` because it incorrectly assumes that moving a cat from box 1 to box 2 and then moving a cat from box 3 to box 4 can be done in one operation, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to handle all possible moves and removals separately and ensure that each operation is counted correctly.
