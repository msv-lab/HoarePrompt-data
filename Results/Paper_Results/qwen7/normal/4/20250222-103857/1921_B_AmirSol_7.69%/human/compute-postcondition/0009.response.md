Postcondition: `counter` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 to 10^5 inclusive, and the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`. Additionally, either `i` is equal to `n-1`, or the next elements satisfy at least one of the following: `s1[i+1] == s2[i+1]`, `s1[i] == s1[i+1]`.
