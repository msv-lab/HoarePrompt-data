Output State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 0, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'.**

The code initializes `i` to 0. The initial values of `counter`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and retains the initial conditions for the other variables.
