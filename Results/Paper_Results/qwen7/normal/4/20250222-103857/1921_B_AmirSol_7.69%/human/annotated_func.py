#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1

        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. After all iterations, `counter` will hold the total number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and satisfies the conditions inside the if block. Specifically, `counter` will count the number of times `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]` and `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i+1]` (if `i < n-1`), or it will simply increment `counter` by 1 if they are different but the condition for the if block is not met. 
    #
    #After all the iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to `n` because the loop increments `i` until `i` is no longer less than `n`. Therefore, the final state will be:
    #
    #- `counter` will be the total number of mismatches between `s1` and `s2` that satisfy the given conditions.
    #- `i` will be `n`.
    #- `n` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop.
    #- `s1` and `s2` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    #
    #In summary, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is characterized by `counter` holding the count of specific mismatches, `i` being equal to `n`, and `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remaining as they were initially.
    return counter
    #The program returns `counter` which holds the total number of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` and satisfies the conditions inside the if block, `i` is set to `n`, and `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)), and two strings \( s1 \) and \( s2 \) of length \( n \) consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the total number of positions where \( s1[i] \) is not equal to \( s2[i] \) and satisfies the conditions inside the if block. After the function execution, the variable \( i \) is set to \( n \), and the original values of \( n \), \( s1 \), and \( s2 \) remain unchanged.
