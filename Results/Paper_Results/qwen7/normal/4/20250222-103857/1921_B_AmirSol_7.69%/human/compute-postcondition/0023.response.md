Output State: **`counter` is either 2 or 3, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than `i`, and `counter` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `counter` is increased by 1 after the condition `n > i` and the initial state of `counter` is either 1 or 2, after executing `i += 1`, `counter` will become either 2 or 3 (depending on its initial value). The value of `i` will be the original value plus 1, which means `i` will be either 2 or 3. The condition `n > i` remains valid as `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.
