Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who manipulate an array to maximize and minimize the sum of its elements, respectively. Alice can remove up to `k` elements, and Bob can negate up to `x` elements.

2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, and `x` for each test case, followed by the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the final sum.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each.

3. **Function `func_2()` Analysis**:
   - This function computes the optimal sum after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array and appends `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` to `pos`. This represents the scenario where no elements are removed and the `x` smallest elements are negated.
   - It iteratively updates `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `x` elements) by removing one element at a time and optionally negating one more element.
   - It appends the updated sums to `pos` and returns the maximum value from `pos`.

4. **Optimality Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2()` considers all possible scenarios where Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements.
   - The approach ensures that the maximum possible sum is considered by iterating through all combinations of removals and negations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases such as when `k` or `x` equals `n` (all elements can be manipulated).
   - The sorting step helps in easily identifying the smallest elements to potentially negate.

Given the detailed analysis, the functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
