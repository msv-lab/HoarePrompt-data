Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `k`, and `x` for each case.
   - It reads the array `a` and sorts it.
   - It calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
   - It prints the result returned by `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function calculates the sum of the array `s`.
   - It initializes a list `pos` with the value of `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, which represents the sum of the array after Alice removes the smallest `negatives` elements and Bob multiplies the next `negatives` elements by `-1`.
   - It iterates from `1` to `removals` and updates `s` and `s2` by subtracting the current element from the end of the array.
   - If `negatives + i` is within the bounds of the array, it adds the corresponding element to `s2`.
   - It appends the value of `s - 2 * s2` to the list `pos` after each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in `func_2` matches the optimal strategy described for the game:
- Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize their impact on the sum.
- Bob should multiply the smallest remaining elements by `-1` to minimize the sum further.

The implementation in `func_2` correctly simulates these strategies and computes the optimal sum.

Correctness: **True**
