Output State: **`i` is 1, `removals` is a positive integer, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-1]`, the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]**.

Explanation: The value of `s2` is incremented by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Given that `i` is 1 and the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, the index `-(negatives + i)` refers to a valid element in the list `elements`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
