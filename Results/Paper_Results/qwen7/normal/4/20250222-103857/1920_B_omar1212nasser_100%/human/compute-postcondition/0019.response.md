Output State: **`s` is equal to its original value minus the last element of the list `elements`, and `i` is unchanged; `pos` is appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `s - 2 * s2` to the list `pos`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `s2` are updated according to the initial postcondition. The value of `s` is now `s - the last element of elements`, and `i` remains unchanged. The list `pos` now includes the new value `s - 2 * s2`.
