Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array). It returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains the computed values of `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, starting from the first iteration up to the last iteration where `i` equals `removals`.**
