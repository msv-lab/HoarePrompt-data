Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1 in an optimal way for all scenarios. Specifically, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
5 2 2
1 2 3 4 5
6 6 3
1 4 3 2 5 6
8 5 3
5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
-5
-9
```

However, the program's `func_2` function does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob make their moves. For instance, in the third test case, the program outputs `-9`, but the correct output should be `-5`. This happens because the function does not properly account for the optimal strategy where Bob can negate multiple negative numbers to minimize the sum, and Alice can remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.

To fix this, the function needs to consider all possible combinations of removals and negations more comprehensively. The current implementation does not cover all potential optimal strategies, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
