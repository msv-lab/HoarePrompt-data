Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to handle the game between Alice and Bob according to the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: It sorts the array `a` to facilitate the optimal strategy for removing elements.
3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes variables to keep track of the sum of the array (`s`) and the sum of the last `x` elements (`s2`).
   - **Calculating Possible Sums**: It iterates through possible scenarios where Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by `-1`. For each scenario, it calculates the potential sum of the array after these operations.
   - **Updating Sums**: It updates the sums `s` and `s2` appropriately for each iteration.
   - **Storing Results**: It stores the calculated sums in the list `pos`.
   - **Returning the Maximum Sum**: Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the optimal sum of the array after both players have played their moves.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function correctly handles all edge cases and computes the desired result accurately. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
