Output State: **`i` is 1; `removals` must be a positive integer; `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the last element of the list `elements` (since `-i` when `i` is 1 refers to the last element) from `s`. The value of `i` remains 1, and `removals` is still required to be a positive integer. The value of `s` is updated by subtracting the last element of `elements`.
