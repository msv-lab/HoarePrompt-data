Output State: **`i` is 1, `removals` is a positive integer, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-1]`, if the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`, `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`**.

This means that the variable `pos` has been appended with the value `s - 2 * s2`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state, with the condition for updating `s2` still applicable.
