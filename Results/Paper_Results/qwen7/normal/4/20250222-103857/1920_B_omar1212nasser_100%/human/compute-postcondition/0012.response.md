Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `removals` is a positive integer
   - `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`
   - `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-1]`
   - If the sum of `negatives` and `i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`
   - `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, removals + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

6. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i <= removals`.
   - Since `removals` is a positive integer, `i` (which is now 2) is still less than or equal to `removals`.

7. **Updating States:**
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `s` and `s2` will be updated based on the current value of `elements[-1]` (the last element of the list).
   - If the condition `negatives + i <= len(elements)` holds true, `s2` will be updated accordingly.
   - `pos` will be updated to a new list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be 2.
- `s` will be updated to `s - elements[-1]`.
- `s2` will be updated to `s2 - elements[-1]`.
- If the condition `negatives + 2 <= len(elements)` holds true, `s2` will be updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 2)]`.
- `pos` will be updated to a new list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `removals` is a positive integer, `s` is `s` minus `elements[-1]`, `s2` is `s2` minus `elements[-1]`, if the sum of `negatives` and `2` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + 2)]`, `pos` is a list with one element which is `s - 2 * s2`**
