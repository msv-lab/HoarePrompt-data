Output State: **`i` is within the range 1 to `k-1`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i + 1]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The other variables (`i`, `ans2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `ans2` was previously equal to `ans1`, it now also increases by the same amount. Consequently, `ans` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
