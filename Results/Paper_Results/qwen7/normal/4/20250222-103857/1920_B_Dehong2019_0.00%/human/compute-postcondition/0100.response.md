Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i_new]`, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `ans1` or `ans2` directly. Instead, it updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans1` and `ans2`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
