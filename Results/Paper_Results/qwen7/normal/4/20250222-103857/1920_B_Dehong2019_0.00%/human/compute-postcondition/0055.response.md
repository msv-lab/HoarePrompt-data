Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to k-1, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1 - 2 * a[i + x]`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**

This means that `ans1` has been decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`, and since `ans2` was previously equal to `ans1`, `ans2` has also been updated to reflect this change. All other conditions remain the same as the initial state.
