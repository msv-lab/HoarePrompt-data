Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of the new `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` decreases `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans`) are updated according to their previous conditions.
