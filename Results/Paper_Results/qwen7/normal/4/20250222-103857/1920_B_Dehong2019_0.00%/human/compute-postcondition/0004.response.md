Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces, and `a` is a list of these integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code first reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. It then converts this map object to a list and sorts it in descending order using `sorted(list(...), reverse=True)`. The sorted list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
