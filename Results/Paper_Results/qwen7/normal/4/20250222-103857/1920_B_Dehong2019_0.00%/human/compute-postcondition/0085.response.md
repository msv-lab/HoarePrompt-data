Output State: `i` is `x`, `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, making `i` take the value of `x` right after the last iteration. The variable `ans1` will be reduced by twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`, as the loop subtracts `2 * a[i]` for each iteration from `0` to `x-1`.
