Output State: **`i` is `k + x - 1`, `ans1` is decreased by the sum of `2 * a[k - 1] + 2 * a[k] + ... + 2 * a[k + x - 2]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`**.

In this state, the variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `k + x - 1`. The variable `ans1` has been decreased by the sum of twice each element from index `k - 1` to `k + x - 2` in the list `a`. The variable `ans2` is now equal to the updated value of `ans1`.
