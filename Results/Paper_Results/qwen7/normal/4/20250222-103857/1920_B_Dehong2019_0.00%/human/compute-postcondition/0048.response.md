Output State: `i` is `k + x - 1`, `ans1` is decreased by the sum of `2 * a[k - 1]` repeated `x` times plus the sum of `2 * a[i]` from `k` to `k + x - 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k + x - 1`. The variable `ans1` will have been decreased by twice the value of each element in the sublist `a[k-1:k+x-1]` of the original list `a`.
