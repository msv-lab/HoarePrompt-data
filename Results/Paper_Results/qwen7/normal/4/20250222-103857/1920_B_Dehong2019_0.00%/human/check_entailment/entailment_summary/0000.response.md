Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the total sum of the array (`ans1`) and attempts to adjust this sum based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
2. For Alice's move, the program removes the smallest elements first to maximize the sum. This is a valid strategy since removing smaller elements leaves larger ones contributing positively to the sum.
3. For Bob's move, the program considers the first `x` elements and adjusts the sum by subtracting twice their value. This reflects Bob's attempt to minimize the sum.
4. The program then iterates through the first `k` elements again, adding them to `ans1` and adjusting for Bob's potential moves, ensuring that the maximum possible sum is considered.
5. Finally, the program outputs the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which correctly represents the optimal sum after both players make their moves.

Given the logic and the approach taken by the program, it aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
