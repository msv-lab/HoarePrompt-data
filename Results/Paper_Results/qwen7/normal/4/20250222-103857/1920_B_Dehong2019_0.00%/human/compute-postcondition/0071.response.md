Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be within the range 0 to `k-1`, `ans1` will be the sum of `a[0]` to `a[k-1]` with adjustments based on the value of `x` and the condition `i + x < n`, `ans2` will be equal to `ans1`, and `ans` will be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

This means that `ans1` will accumulate the values from the array `a` starting from index `0` up to `k-1`, adjusting its value based on the presence of elements `x` steps ahead (if they exist) by subtracting twice their value. `ans2` will always mirror the value of `ans1` because it is updated every iteration to be equal to `ans1`. The variable `ans` will hold the highest value between `ans1` and `ans2` throughout the iterations.
