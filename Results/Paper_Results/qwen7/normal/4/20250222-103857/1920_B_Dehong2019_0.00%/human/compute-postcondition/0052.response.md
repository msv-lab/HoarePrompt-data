Output State: **`i` is within the range 0 to k-1, ans1 is increased by a[i], ans2 is equal to ans1**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is within the range 0 to k-1, the value of `i` remains unchanged. `ans2` is set to be equal to `ans1` before this operation, so after the increment, `ans2` will also be updated to reflect the new value of `ans1`.
