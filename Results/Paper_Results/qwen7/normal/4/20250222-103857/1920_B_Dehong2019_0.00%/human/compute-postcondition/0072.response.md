Output State: `i` is within the range 0 to `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of `a[0]` to `a[k-1]` with adjustments based on the value of `x` and the condition `i + x < n`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have gone through all possible values from 0 to `k-1`. During each iteration, `ans1` accumulates the sum of elements from the array `a` starting from index `i` up to `i + x - 1` (if within bounds), while also subtracting twice the element at index `i + x` if it exists. `ans2` is always kept equal to `ans1`, and `ans` keeps track of the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` throughout the loop's execution.
