Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[0]`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects `ans1`. The initial value of `i` was 0, and `x` must be a positive integer, which remains unaffected.
