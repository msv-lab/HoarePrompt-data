Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` is the input integer provided before the loop starts, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, and `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `tmp`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
