### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly initializes `t` (number of test cases) and an empty list `r` to store results.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of constraints).
   - It uses sets and variables `ax` and `bx` to track the lower and upper bounds of valid `k` values, respectively.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to a set `cx` to track values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to `r` because no valid `k` exists.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within `[bx, ax]` from the total range `[ax, bx]`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all specified scenarios and guarantees.

### Correctness:
**True**
