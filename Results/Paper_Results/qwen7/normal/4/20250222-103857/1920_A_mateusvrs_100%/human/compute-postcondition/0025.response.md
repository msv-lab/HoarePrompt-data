Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` and `x` are input integers. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Otherwise, `cx` is updated to be a set containing `x`, and `ax` remains as 2 if `a` is 2, or 1000000007 if `a` is not 2.**
