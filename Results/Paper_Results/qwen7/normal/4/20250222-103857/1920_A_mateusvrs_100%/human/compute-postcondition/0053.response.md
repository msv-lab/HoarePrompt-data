Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 7, `bx` is 3, `ax` is 8, `tmp` is 5.**

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to process elements in `cx` until there are no more elements left. The values of `bx` and `ax` are fixed at 3 and 8 respectively, and `tmp` increases by 1 each time an element `i` in `cx` satisfies the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`. After three iterations, `tmp` reaches 5. Since the loop has executed all its iterations and there are no more elements in `cx` to process, the final state of the loop is such that `i` is the last element processed (which would be 7 based on the pattern), `bx` and `ax` remain unchanged, and `tmp` is 5.
