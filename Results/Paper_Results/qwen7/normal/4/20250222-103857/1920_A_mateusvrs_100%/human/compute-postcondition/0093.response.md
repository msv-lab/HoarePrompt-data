Postcondition: `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `x` is an integer equal to the second input number. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a`. Otherwise, `cx` now contains the element `x`.
