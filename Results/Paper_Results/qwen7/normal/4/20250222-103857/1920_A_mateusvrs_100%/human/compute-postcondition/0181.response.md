Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints defined within its scope. It returns a specific output based on the given constraints, which include an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) for each test case, and n lines of constraints where each line contains two integers a (1 ≤ a ≤ 3) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.**
