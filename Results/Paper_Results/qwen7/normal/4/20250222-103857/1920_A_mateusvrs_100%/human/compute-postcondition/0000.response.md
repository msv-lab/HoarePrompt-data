Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, after executing the code, `t` will still satisfy this condition, but its specific value is now determined by the user's input. The other conditions and constraints related to `n` and the subsequent lines of constraints remain unaffected by this code snippet.
