Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for an index) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable that determines whether the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This means `t` is already within the valid range, but we need to explicitly state that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **List the adjusted states**: We need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`_` and `r`) do not affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list**
