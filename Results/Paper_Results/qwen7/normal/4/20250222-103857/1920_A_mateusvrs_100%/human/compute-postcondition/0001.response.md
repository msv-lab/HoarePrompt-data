Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `r` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `r`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer within the range of 1 to 500, and `r` is now an empty list.
