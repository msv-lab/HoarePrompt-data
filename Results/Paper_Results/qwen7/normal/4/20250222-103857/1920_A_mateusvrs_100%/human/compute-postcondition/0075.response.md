Postcondition: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is an input integer, and `a` is either 1 or not equal to 1. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`. If `a` does not equal 1, `cx` includes `x` and `bx` remains -1.
