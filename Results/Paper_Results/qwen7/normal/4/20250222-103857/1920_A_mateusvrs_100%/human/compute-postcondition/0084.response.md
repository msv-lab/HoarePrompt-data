Postcondition: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is either a set containing `x` or an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is a specific integer (either 1 or not 1), and `x` is a specific integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`; otherwise, `cx` becomes a set containing `x` and `ax` remains as `min(x, 1000000000)`.
