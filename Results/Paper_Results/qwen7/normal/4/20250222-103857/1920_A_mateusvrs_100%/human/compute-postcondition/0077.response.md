The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. This means `a` and `x` are now specific integers based on user input. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `a` is a specific integer (either 1 or not 1), and `x` is a specific integer.**
