Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates.**

Explanation: The code sets `ax` to the value of `1000000000 + 7` which is `1000000007`. However, due to the precision issue with floating-point arithmetic in Python, it is explicitly cast to an integer, resulting in `1000000000`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
