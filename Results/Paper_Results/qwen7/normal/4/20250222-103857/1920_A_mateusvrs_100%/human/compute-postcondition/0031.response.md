Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` is already a member of the set `cx`, adding it again does not change the set. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
