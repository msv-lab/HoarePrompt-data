Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `r` is an empty list remains unchanged.
