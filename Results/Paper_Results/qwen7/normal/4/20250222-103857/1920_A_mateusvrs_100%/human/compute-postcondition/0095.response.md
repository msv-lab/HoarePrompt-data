Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` is the input integer provided before the loop starts, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values provided as inputs, and `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values provided as inputs. `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, and `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains 0, `r` remains a list containing 0, `n` retains its initial value which was the number of iterations the loop was supposed to run, `cx` contains every unique `x` value that was input during the loop's execution, `ax` holds the smallest `x` value among all inputs, and `bx` holds the largest `x` value among all inputs. The variables `a` and `x` will hold the values of the last `a` and `x` that were input respectively when the loop terminated.
