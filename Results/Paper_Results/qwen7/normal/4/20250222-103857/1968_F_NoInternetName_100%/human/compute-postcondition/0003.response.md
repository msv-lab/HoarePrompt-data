Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with no items, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `q` is a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing the digits of `func_1(n)`, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a defaultdict named `inds`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, or `x`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
