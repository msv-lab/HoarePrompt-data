Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than or equal to `l` or the first element if no such element exists.
- `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.

The `print('No')` statement will simply print the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
