You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

#Function 3:
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)

#Function 4:
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if result is not None:
        return result + 1
    return None

#Function 5:
def func_5():
    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list `a` of integers and handles multiple queries defined by pairs of indices `(l, r)`. For each query, it checks if the prefix XOR sums up to `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the smallest index in the list of indices where the prefix XOR sum is less than `l` and the largest index where the prefix XOR sum is less than or equal to `r`. If the upper bound index is greater than the lower bound index, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the XOR values match, but it does not handle the XOR operations and index searches correctly.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **XOR Calculation and Index Tracking**: The program calculates the cumulative XOR `x` for the array and uses a dictionary `inds` to track indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs. However, the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting is flawed.

2. **Predicate Function Logic**: The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are used to find indices using binary search, but they do not correctly handle the conditions needed to determine if a subarray is interesting.

3. **Incorrect XOR Matching**: The program checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]`, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is interesting. It also incorrectly uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find indices, which may not accurately reflect the required conditions.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
4
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
2 3
7 4
12 9 10 9 10 11 9
1 5
1 7
2 6
2 7
11 4
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1
1 2
2 5
6 9
7 11
```

The program fails to correctly identify interesting subarrays in some cases, such as the third and fourth queries in the first test case, and the last three queries in the fifth test case. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
