Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with the item `{0: [0, 1, 2], 1: [1, 2, 4]}`, `x` is a list `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the length of the list `x` minus one (`len(x) - 1`) to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Initially, `x[-1]` is `1`, and `inds[1]` is `[1, 2]`. Therefore, `4` (which is `len(x) - 1` when `x` is `[0, 1, 1, 2, 1]`) is appended to `inds[1]`, making `inds[1]` become `[1, 2, 4]`. The list `x` is extended by one element, which is `4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
