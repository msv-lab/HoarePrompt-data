Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(q)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 1
   - `q` is a positive integer
   - `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`
   - `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < q`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `q`, we need to update these variables for the next iteration. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `q` is a positive integer, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `q` remains unchanged.

5. **Final State**: After adjusting the state, the new state for the next iteration should be:
   - `i` is 2
   - `q` is a positive integer (unchanged)
   - `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)` (unchanged)
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)` (unchanged)
   - `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `q` is a positive integer, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists**.
