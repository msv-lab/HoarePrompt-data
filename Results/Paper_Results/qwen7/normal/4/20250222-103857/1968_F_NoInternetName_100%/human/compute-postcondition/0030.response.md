Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the index in `inds[x[r]]` where the element is less than `l` or the first element if no such element exists.
- `upper` is the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` where the element is less than or equal to `r` or the first element if no such element exists.
- `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output is:

Output: **No**
