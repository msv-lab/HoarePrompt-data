You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list `a` of integers and handles multiple queries defined by pairs of indices `(l, r)`. For each query, it checks if the prefix XOR sums up to `l-1` and `r` are equal. If they are, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it finds the smallest index in the list of indices where the prefix XOR sum is less than `l` and the largest index where the prefix XOR sum is less than or equal to `r`. If the upper bound index is greater than the lower bound index, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of the values in each part is the same.
   - We need to process multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code provided includes several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that do not seem directly related to solving the main problem. These functions might be intended for other purposes but are not used in the core logic.
   - The main function `func_5` processes each test case and query.

3. **Core Logic Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `inds` is a dictionary where keys are XOR results and values are lists of indices where these results occur.
     - `x` is a prefix XOR array, which helps in quickly finding the XOR of any subarray.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query `(l, r)`, the code checks if the XOR of the entire subarray `[l, r]` is zero. If it is, the subarray is trivially interesting.
     - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the smallest index `lower` where the XOR is the same as the right boundary of the subarray.
     - It also finds the largest index `upper` where the XOR is the same as the left boundary of the subarray.
     - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the subarray is interesting.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The use of `func_2` and `func_4` for binary search seems unnecessary and complicates the logic.
   - The code assumes that the XOR of the entire subarray can be checked directly, which simplifies the problem significantly.
   - The binary search approach in `func_2` and `func_4` is not correctly implemented for this specific problem.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic of checking the XOR of the entire subarray and using binary search to find the boundaries is conceptually correct.
   - However, the implementation of binary search in `func_2` and `func_4` is not necessary and could be simplified.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is mostly correct in its logic but overly complicated with unnecessary functions. The core logic can be simplified without the need for binary search functions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
