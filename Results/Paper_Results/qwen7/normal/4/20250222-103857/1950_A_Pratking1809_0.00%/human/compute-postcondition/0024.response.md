Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `i` is `q`, if `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
