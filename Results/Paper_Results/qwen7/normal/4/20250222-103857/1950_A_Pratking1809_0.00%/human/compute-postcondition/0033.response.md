Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers that were processed by the loop. If the loop iterated exactly `q` times, then for each iteration, either the condition `a < b < c` was met or the condition `a < b > c` was met, but no other conditions were checked or printed.
