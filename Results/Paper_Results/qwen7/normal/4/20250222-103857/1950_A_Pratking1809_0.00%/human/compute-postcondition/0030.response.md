Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a` is the first input integer.
- `b` is the second input integer.
- `c` is the third input integer.
- The condition `a < b < c` holds true.
- `i` is `q + 1`.

The print statement is simply `print('PEAK')`.

Since the statement is printing a string literal `'PEAK'`, it will print exactly that string without any modification based on the other variables provided.

Output: **PEAK**
