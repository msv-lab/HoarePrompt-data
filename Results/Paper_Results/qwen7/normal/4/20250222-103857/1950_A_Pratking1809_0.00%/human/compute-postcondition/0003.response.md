Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**.

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t`, `q`, and `mn` remain unchanged.
