Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `q = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `q`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and is not affected by the input operation.
