Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- `i` is set to `q`.

The print statement is `print('NONE')`.

The value printed by this statement is explicitly given within the print function itself, regardless of the values of other variables like `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `t`, `q`, and `mn`.

Output: **NONE**
