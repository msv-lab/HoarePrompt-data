Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(q)`.
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The variable `q` is the upper limit of the range.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `mn` is 100 (this variable is not involved in the loop head).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `q` is less than 1, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `q` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it will be set by the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `q` must be at least 1.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100**
