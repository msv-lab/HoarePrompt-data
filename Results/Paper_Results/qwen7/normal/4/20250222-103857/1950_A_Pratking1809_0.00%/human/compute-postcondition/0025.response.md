Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is defined in the range `range(q)`.
   - Therefore, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < q`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `q`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` was equal to `q` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = q + 1`.
   - `q` remains unchanged because the value of `q` is determined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `i` is `q + 1`**.
