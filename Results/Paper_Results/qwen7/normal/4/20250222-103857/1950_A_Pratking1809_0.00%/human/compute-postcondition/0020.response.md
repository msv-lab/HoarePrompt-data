Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` must be at least 1, `mn` is 100, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `i` is `q`. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, then the condition `a < b < c` is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.
