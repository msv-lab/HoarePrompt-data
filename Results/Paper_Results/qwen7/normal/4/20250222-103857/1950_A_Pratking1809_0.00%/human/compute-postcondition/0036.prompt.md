You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `mn` is 100, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, and the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last iteration of the loop are the most recent inputs provided, and the loop has printed 'STAIR' if `a < b < c` and 'PEAK' if `a < b > c` for those inputs. If neither condition is met, it printed 'NONE'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes integers t, a, b, and c within specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9) and returns a result based on these values.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
