Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `mn` is 100.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- `i` is set to `q` if the condition `a < b < c` is met. Otherwise, `i` is not explicitly defined but does not affect the `print` statement.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
