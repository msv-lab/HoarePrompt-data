Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `q` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `mn` is 100, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, and the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last iteration of the loop are the most recent inputs provided, and the loop has printed 'STAIR' if `a < b < c` and 'PEAK' if `a < b > c` for those inputs. If neither condition is met, it printed 'NONE'.
