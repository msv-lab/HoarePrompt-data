You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `q` sets of three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) within the range 0 to 9. For each set, it checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR', if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK'. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all sets, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each set.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then iterates through each test case.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100, which is not used in the program. This can be removed as it does not affect the logic.
3. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
5. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
6. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a logical issue with the way the conditions are checked. Specifically, the conditions should be mutually exclusive, but the current implementation will print 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' even if both conditions are true for the same test case. This is because the conditions are checked sequentially, and the second condition (`a < b > c`) will always evaluate to false if `a < b < c` is true.

To fix this, we need to ensure that only one of the conditions is checked at a time, and the other is skipped if the first condition is true.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has a logical flaw due to the sequential checking of conditions without proper mutual exclusivity. After fixing this, the program should work correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
