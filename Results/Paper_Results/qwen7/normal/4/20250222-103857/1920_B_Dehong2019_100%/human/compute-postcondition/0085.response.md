Output State: `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of all elements in `a` (i.e., `ans1` is now 0), `ans2` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is equal to or greater than the length of the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The loop subtracts twice the value of each element in `a` from `ans1` for each iteration. Therefore, `ans1` will eventually become 0 because it initially was the sum of all elements in `a`, and it gets reduced by twice the sum of all elements in `a` over the course of the loop. All other variables remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
