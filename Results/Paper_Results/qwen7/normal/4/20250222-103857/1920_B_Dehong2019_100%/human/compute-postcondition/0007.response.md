Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 0, it means `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The value of `x` remains greater than 0 and `i` remains 0 as no changes were made to these variables.
