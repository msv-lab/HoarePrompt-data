Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is less than `k`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `a[i + x] * 2` from `ans1`. The value of `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and the original `ans2`. The condition `i < k` remains unchanged.
