Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `k`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` remains unchanged, the value of `i` from the previous iteration will be used again.
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is still less than `k`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

Given that `i` remains unchanged and the loop will continue as long as `i < k`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `k` for the next iteration.

**Final State**:
- `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` remains unchanged, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` must be less than `k`**.
