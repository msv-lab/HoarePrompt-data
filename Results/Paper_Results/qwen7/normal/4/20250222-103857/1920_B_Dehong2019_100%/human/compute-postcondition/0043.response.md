Output State: **`i` is `k-1`; `x` must be greater than `k-1`; `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i]` from it. Given that `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k-1]`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
