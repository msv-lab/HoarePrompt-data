Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `ans1` will be the sum of elements from `a[0]` to `a[k-1]` with specific adjustments based on the value of `x`, and `ans2` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` throughout the loop iterations.

In more detail:
- `i` will be set to `k` after the last iteration of the loop.
- `ans1` will be calculated as follows: it starts at 0 and for each iteration `i` from 0 to `k-1`, it adds `a[i]` to itself. However, if `i + x < n`, then `2 * a[i + x]` is subtracted from `ans1`.
- `ans2` will keep track of the maximum value between `ans1` and its previous value after each iteration of the loop.
