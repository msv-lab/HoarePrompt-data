Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State**: Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop condition depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`_`) are not relevant for the loop condition and do not need adjustment.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
