Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k-1`.
   - `x` must be greater than `k-1`.
   - `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[k-1]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increases by `1` each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k`.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must still be greater than `k` (which is `i` at the start of the next iteration).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `k` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `x` must remain greater than `k`.

6. **Consider other states**:
   - `ans1` is not part of the loop head, so its value does not change based on the loop itself. It was already updated in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `k`, `x` must be greater than `k`**
