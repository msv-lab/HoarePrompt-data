Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, and if `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates `ans2` to be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. No changes are made to `ans1` itself from this line of code. The conditions under which `ans1` is modified (increased by `a[i]` and possibly further decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the original conditions for `ans1` and the updated value for `ans2`.
