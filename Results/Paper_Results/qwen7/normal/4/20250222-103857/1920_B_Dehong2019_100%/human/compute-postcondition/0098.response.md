Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is less than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `ans1`. The condition that `i` must be less than `k` is also preserved.
