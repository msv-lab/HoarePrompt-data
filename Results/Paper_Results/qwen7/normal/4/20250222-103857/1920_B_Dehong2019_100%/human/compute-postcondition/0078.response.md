Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `i`, `ans2` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the element at index `i` from `ans1`. Since `i` was initially 0, after executing this line, `i` becomes 1 (assuming the increment happens automatically in the context of a loop, though it's not explicitly shown). All other variables remain unchanged.
