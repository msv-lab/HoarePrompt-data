Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `k`.

3. **Determine the changes in the loop body**:
   - `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.
   - `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is less than `k` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` will be updated based on the loop body, but these updates are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect the condition for the loop to continue.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (since it was less than `k` and will be incremented).
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` are updated inside the loop body but their values are not specified here, so we cannot directly state them without knowing the exact values from the loop body.

Given the information, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `k`.

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` must be greater than `i`**
