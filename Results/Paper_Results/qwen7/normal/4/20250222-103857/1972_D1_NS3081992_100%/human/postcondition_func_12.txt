The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers and `b` is not zero. It returns a tuple containing three elements: `x`, `y`, and `g`. In the first case, if `b` is zero, it returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` as a positive integer. In the second case, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `y` and `x` are the results of the recursive call, and `g` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
