Output State: `i` is greater than `m` or `i * i` is greater than `n + i`, `n` is the return value of `func_7()`, `m` is the return value of `func_7()`, `ans` is the sum of the original value of `ans` plus the contributions from each iteration.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
- After all iterations, either `i` will exceed `m` or `i * i` will exceed `n + i`, ensuring the loop terminates.
- The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each valid `i` from 1 up to the point where the loop condition fails.
- The exact final value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m` returned by `func_7()`, but it will be the sum of all terms added during the loop's execution.
