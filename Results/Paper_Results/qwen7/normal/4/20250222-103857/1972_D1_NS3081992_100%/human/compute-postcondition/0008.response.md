Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calls `func_15()` for each test case to determine the number of valid pairs and writes these values to standard output, followed by a newline. The total number of test cases processed is determined by `func_10()`, which returns an integer between 1 and \( 10^4 \). The sum of \( n \) and \( m \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \).**
