### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Code Structure Analysis:**
   - The code includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_16`), but none of them directly address the problem's requirements.
   - The main function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_15` for each test case.
   - `func_15` is supposed to handle the actual computation for each test case.

3. **Function `func_15` Analysis:**
   - `func_15` reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to the smallest integer \(i\) such that \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.

4. **Function Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_15` does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it performs a simple arithmetic operation without considering the gcd condition.

5. **Comparison with Problem Requirements:**
   - The problem requires checking the gcd condition and ensuring \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_15` does not perform these checks and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
