Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program does not contain any function that implements this logic. Instead, it contains various utility functions that do not seem to be related to solving the problem at hand. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
