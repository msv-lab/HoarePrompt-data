### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code includes several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_16`), but none of them directly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - `func_15` is the only function that seems to be relevant to the problem, but it does not correctly implement the required logic.
   - `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs using a different approach, specifically:
     - It iterates over values of \(i\) from 1 to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of \(n + m\).
     - It sums up \(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\) for each \(i\).
     - It returns this sum minus one.
   - This approach does not match the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that `func_15` is the only function that attempts to solve the problem, but it uses a different method and does not correctly implement the logic.
   - The other functions are utility functions and do not contribute to solving the main problem.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not implement the required logic and is therefore incorrect.
   - Given the analysis, the assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
