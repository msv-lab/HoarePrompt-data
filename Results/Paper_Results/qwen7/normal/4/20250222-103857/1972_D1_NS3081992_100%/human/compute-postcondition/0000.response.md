Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`.
   - The only variable mentioned here is the loop counter `_`, but since it is typically an underscore and not used within the loop, we focus on the function call `func_10()`.

2. **Understand the Function `func_10()`:**
   - `func_10()` returns an integer representing the number of test cases (t).
   - The value of `t` is between 1 and \(10^4\).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` (the number of test cases) is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.
   - We don't need to adjust the state of any other variables because they are not involved in the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `func_10()` returns a value greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0**
