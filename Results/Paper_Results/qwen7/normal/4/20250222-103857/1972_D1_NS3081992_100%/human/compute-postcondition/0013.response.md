Output State: `i` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + m`, `n` is the return value of `func_7()`, `m` is the return value of `func_7()`, `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of `n + m`.

To explain further, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, and in each iteration, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`. The loop will terminate when `i` exceeds `m` or when `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. Therefore, `i` will be the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`, which is approximately the square root of `n + m`. The final value of `ans` will be the sum of the contributions from each iteration of the loop.
