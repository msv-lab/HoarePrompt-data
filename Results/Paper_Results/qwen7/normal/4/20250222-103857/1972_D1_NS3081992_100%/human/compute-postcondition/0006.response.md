Output State: **The output state will include `sys.stdout.write` being called `func_10()` times, each time writing the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `sys.stdout.write` will have been called exactly `t` times (where `t` is the number of test cases returned by `func_10()`), with each call writing the value returned by `func_15()` for that particular test case, followed by a newline character. The values written correspond to the number of valid pairs for each test case, and since `func_10()` returns the total number of test cases and `func_15()` returns a positive integer for each test case, the output will consist of `t` lines, each containing a positive integer.
