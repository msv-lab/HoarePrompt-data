Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized with zeros, an integer `da` which is a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized with zeros. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for each element `di` in `d[da]`, updating the `processing` list and calculating the minimum value `tmp`. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns this value.**
