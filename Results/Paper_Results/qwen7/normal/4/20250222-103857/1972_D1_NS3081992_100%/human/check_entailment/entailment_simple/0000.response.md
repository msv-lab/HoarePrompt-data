Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**: The functions `func_10`, `func_15`, and `func_16` are correctly defined and used to handle the input and process the test cases as per the problem statement.
2. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) using `func_10()`, which is expected to return an integer.
3. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, `func_15()` is called, which processes the input integers `n` and `m` and calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the given conditions.
4. **Output Writing**: The program writes the result of `func_15()` for each test case to the standard output, which is correct as per the problem requirements.
5. **Correctness of `func_15`**: The function `func_15` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case. It iterates over possible values of `i` and uses the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` to count valid pairs.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
