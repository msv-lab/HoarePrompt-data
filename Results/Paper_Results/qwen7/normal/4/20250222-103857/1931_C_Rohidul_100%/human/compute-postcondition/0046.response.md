Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `r` must be greater than 1, `end` is 2, `ans` is max(0, le - (st + end)), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input such that `a[0] == a[1]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 3, `end` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
