Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is equal to `r - 1` (since `l` keeps increasing by 1 each iteration until it is no longer less than `r`), `r` is the original value of `n - 1`, `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]` (because the loop stops when `l` is no longer less than `r` or when `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`), `st` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, which is `l + 1`, `end` is 1.

This means that after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `l` will be one less than `r`, indicating that the last pair of elements `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]` were not equal, causing the loop to terminate. The variable `st` will hold the total number of iterations the loop performed.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is decreased by 1; `end` is increased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `r` is now `r - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`; `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `r` is greater than `l`, and `end` is increased by 1, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 2]`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
