Output State: **All test cases have been processed, and `ans` contains the result for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the output state will reflect that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the variable `ans` will contain the calculated result based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, `ans` is determined by the logic inside the loop, which adjusts based on the values of `st`, `end`, and whether the first and last elements of the list `a` are equal. The final value of `ans` for each test case represents the maximum length of a subarray where adjacent elements are equal, considering the special condition when the first and last elements are also equal.
