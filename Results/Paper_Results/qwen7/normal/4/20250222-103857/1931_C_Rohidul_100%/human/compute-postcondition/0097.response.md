Output State: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`, `r` is equal to `l+1`, and `end` is increased to the maximum number of iterations performed, which is `le-1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be equal to `r-1` because the loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` until `l` is no longer less than `r`. This means that all consecutive duplicates have been removed from the list. The variable `st` remains equal to `n` because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `end` will be equal to the total number of times the loop executed, which is `le-1` since the loop removes one duplicate per execution and stops when there are no more consecutive duplicates.
