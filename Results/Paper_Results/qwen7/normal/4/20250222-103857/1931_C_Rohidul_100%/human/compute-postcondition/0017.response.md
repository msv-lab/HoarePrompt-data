To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1: `r > l`**
   - This condition ensures that the loop can execute at least once. For the loop to start, `r` must be greater than `l`.
   - Given that `l` is initially set to `r - 1`, the condition `r > l` simplifies to `r > r - 1`, which is always true as long as `r` is greater than 0.

2. **Condition 2: `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
   - This condition ensures that the loop continues to execute. For the loop to continue, the element at index `r` must be equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
- `le` is the length of list `a`
- `l` is equal to `r - 1`
- `r` is the original value of `n - 1`
- `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`
- `st` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, which is `l + 1`
- `end` is 1

We need to ensure that both conditions are met for the loop to execute the first time:
- `r > l` is always true given the initial setup.
- `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true for the loop to execute.

Since `l` is initially set to `r - 1`, the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` translates to checking if the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true.

**State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `le` is the length of list `a`, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is the original value of `n - 1`, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, which is `l + 1`, `end` is 1**
