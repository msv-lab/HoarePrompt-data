Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `a` is a list of integers created from space-separated inputs, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` from the previous iteration, `ans` is either updated to `max(0, le - ((n - k - 1) + (2k + 1)))` or remains unchanged based on the first and last elements of the new list `a`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to both `st` and `end`. All other variables retain their previous values.
