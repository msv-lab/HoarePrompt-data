Output State: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the original value of `n - 1`, `end` is 2, `ans` is max(0, le - (st + end)), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, `end` is 2.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` is also incremented by 1. This process repeats until `l` is no longer less than `r` or `a[l]` is no longer equal to `a[l + 1]`. At the end of the loop, `l` will be equal to `r` because the condition `l < r` will fail, and `st` will be the last incremented value based on how many times the loop executed.
