Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - 2`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, `end` is 2, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
