Output State: `le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `l` reaches `r-1`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `st` is `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and increase `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. Since the loop executes until `l` is no longer less than `r`, it means that `l` will eventually be equal to `r-1` when the condition `l < r` fails. At this point, all consecutive duplicates in the list have been removed, and `st` will be equal to the original value of `n` because each iteration increments `st` by 1.
