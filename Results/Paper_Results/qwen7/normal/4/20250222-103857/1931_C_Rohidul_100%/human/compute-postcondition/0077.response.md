Output State: **`le` is the length of the new list `a`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `le` is mentioned to be the length of the new list `a`, it is likely that `l` and `le` refer to the same variable. Therefore, `le` is also increased by 1. The conditions for `n` and the equality of `a[0]` and `a[1]` remain unchanged.
