Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) positive integers in an array a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information about the array a based on the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value t and an array a of n integers. It processes these inputs without needing them as direct function parameters but rather through the structure of the input data it receives.
