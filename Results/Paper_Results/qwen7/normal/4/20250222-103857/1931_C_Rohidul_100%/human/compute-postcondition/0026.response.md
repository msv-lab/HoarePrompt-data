Output State: `r` is one less than `l`; `end` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, which is `l - r`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `r` will be one less than `l` because the loop continues to decrement `r` until `a[r]` is no longer equal to `a[r - 1]`. The variable `end` will hold the total number of iterations the loop performed, which is `l - r`.
