Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is the original value of `n - 1`, `end` is 2, `ans` is max(0, le - (st + end)), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, `end` is 2.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` is also incremented by 1. This process repeats until `l` is no longer less than `r` or `a[l]` is no longer equal to `a[l + 1]`. At the end of the loop, `l` will be equal to `r` because the condition `l < r` will fail, and `st` will be the last incremented value based on how many times the loop executed.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - 2`, `end` is 3, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, and `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - 3`, `end` is 5, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `end` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` must be equal.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
