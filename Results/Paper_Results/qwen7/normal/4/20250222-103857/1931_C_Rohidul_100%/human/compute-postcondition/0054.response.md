Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is equal to `r` + 1, `r` is now `n - 2`, `end` is 3, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the last incremented value of `st` inside the loop, and `end` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was set to 2. After executing the code, `end` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.
