Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `le` is the length of the new list `a`.
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` and continue to be equal to subsequent elements until `le-1`. This means that `a` is a list where all elements from the first to the last but one are the same.
4. `l` is equal to `r-1`.
5. `st` is `n`.
6. `r` is equal to `l+1`.
7. `end` is `le-1`.
8. `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`.

Given these conditions, let's determine the value of `ans`:

- `st` is `n`.
- `end` is `le-1`.
- Therefore, `ans` is `max(0, le - (n + (le-1)))`.

Simplifying the expression inside `max`:
\[ \text{ans} = \max(0, le - n - le + 1) = \max(0, 1 - n) \]

Since `n` must be greater than 1, `1 - n` will be negative. Thus, `max(0, 1 - n)` will be `0`.

So, the value of `ans` is `0`.

Output: **0**
