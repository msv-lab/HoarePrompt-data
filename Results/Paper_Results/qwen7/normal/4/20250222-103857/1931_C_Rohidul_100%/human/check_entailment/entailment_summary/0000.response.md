Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest segment of consecutive equal elements at the beginning and end of the array and then calculating the cost of making all elements equal using a single operation. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Segments**: The program tries to find the longest segment of consecutive equal elements at the beginning and end but does not correctly handle the entire array. It only checks up to `r` and `l` which may not cover the whole array.

2. **Adjustment for Equal Ends**: The adjustment when the first and last elements are equal is incorrect. The program subtracts the sum of the lengths of the segments from the total length of the array, which does not necessarily give the minimum cost.

3. **Single Operation Constraint**: The problem requires the use of at most one operation to make all elements equal. The current approach does not ensure that the operation is used optimally to achieve this.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
