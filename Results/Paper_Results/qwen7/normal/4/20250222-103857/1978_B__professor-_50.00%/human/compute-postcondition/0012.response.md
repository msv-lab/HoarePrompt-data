Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `b` is greater than `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `t`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `t`.
