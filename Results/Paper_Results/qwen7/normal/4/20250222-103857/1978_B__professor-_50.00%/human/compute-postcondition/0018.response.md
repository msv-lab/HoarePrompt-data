Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to integers from the input split by spaces.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is:
\[ \text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) \]

Let's break down the expression step by step:
1. `2 * b` multiplies `b` by 2.
2. Subtract `n` from the result of step 1.
3. Add 1 to the result of step 2.
4. Multiply the result of step 3 by `n`.
5. Divide the result of step 4 by 2.
6. Convert the result of step 5 to an integer.

Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to integers from the input split by spaces, let's denote the actual values of `n` and `b` as `n_val` and `b_val` respectively. The expression then becomes:
\[ \text{int}((2 * b_val - n_val + 1) * n_val / 2) \]

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of the expression above, where `n_val` and `b_val` are the actual integer values provided as input.

Output: **int((2 * b_val - n_val + 1) * n_val / 2)**
