Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the expression).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer and `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

We need to evaluate the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` and then convert it to an integer.

Let's break down the expression step-by-step:

1. `2 * b`: This is twice the value of `b`.
2. `- n`: Subtract `n` from the result of step 1.
3. `+ 1`: Add 1 to the result of step 2.
4. `* n`: Multiply the result of step 3 by `n`.
5. `/ 2`: Divide the result of step 4 by 2.
6. `int(...)`: Convert the result of step 5 to an integer.

Given that `b > a` and `b - a ≥ n`, let's denote `b = a + k` where `k ≥ n`.

Substituting `b = a + k` into the expression:

\[ (2 * (a + k) - n + 1) * n / 2 \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ (2a + 2k - n + 1) * n / 2 \]

This simplifies further to:

\[ (2a + 2k - n + 1) * n / 2 \]

Since we are converting the result to an integer, the exact value depends on the specific values of `a`, `k`, and `n`, but the form of the expression remains the same.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)**
