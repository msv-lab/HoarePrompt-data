Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
\[ \text{int} \left( \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n \right) \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate \( b - a \):**
   Since `b` is greater than `a` and the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`, let's denote this difference as \( d \). So, \( d = b - a \) and \( 0 < d < n \).

2. **Substitute \( d \) into the formula:**
   \[ \frac{d \times (d + 1)}{2} + a \times n \]

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[ \frac{d(d + 1)}{2} + a \times n \]
   This is the sum of the first \( d \) positive integers plus \( a \times n \).

4. **Determine the type of the result:**
   The expression is evaluated and then converted to an integer using `int()`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * n)**
