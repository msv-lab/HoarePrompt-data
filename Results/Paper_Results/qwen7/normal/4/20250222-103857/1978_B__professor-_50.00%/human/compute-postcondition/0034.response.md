Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. Depending on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `n`, it calculates and prints one of three possible results. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value.**
