Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b` for each iteration where '1' was present, and `b` is the last input string from the user containing the character '1'.**

In this final state, `t` and `a` retain their initial conditions as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to 2 because the loop iterates three times, incrementing `i` by 1 each time. The list `k` will contain the count of '1's from each input string `b` where '1' was found. If '1' was not found in any of the inputs, `k` will remain an empty list. The variable `b` will hold the value of the last input string provided during the loop's execution.
