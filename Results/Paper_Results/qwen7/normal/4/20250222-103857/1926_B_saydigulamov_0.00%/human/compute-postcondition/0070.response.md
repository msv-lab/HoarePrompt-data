Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is at least 1, `i` is 7, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the combined string of the original `b` and all subsequent input strings from the user, and `b` is the final input string from the user.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 100, `a` will still be at least 1, and `i` will be 7. The list `k` will contain the cumulative count of the character '1' found in all the input strings provided during the loop's execution, starting from the original string `b` and including all subsequent inputs. The variable `b` will hold the last input string provided by the user.
