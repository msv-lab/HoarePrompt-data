Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b`, and `b` is the new input string from the user containing the character '1'.**

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is given to contain the character '1', `b.count('1')` will be 1. Therefore, `k` will now be a list containing the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
