Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `a` is at least 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b` for each iteration where '1' was present.
- `b` is the last input string from the user containing the character '1'.
- The current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`.

Since `k[0]` and `k[1]` are equal, let's denote their common value as `count`. This means `k` is a list with two elements, both equal to `count`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the list `k`.

Output: **[count, count]** (where `count` is the number of times '1' appeared in the string `b` during the iterations)
