Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b` for each iteration where '1' was present, and `b` is the last input string from the user containing the character '1'. The current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`.
