Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, and `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `oneInd` by calling `func_1(preOne, zr)` and multiplying the result by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The new value of `oneInd` depends on the function `func_1` which takes `preOne` (which was previously `totalOne - 1`) and `zr` (which was previously `len(suffZero) - 1`).
