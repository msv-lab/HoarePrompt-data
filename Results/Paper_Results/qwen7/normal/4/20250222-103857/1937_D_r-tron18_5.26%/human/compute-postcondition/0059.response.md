Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `el` is now `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates `ol` and `zr` to be the same as `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
