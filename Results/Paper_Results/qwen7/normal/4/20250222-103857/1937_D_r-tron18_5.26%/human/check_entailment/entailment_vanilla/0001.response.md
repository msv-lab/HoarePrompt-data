Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid with `n` cells.
   - Each cell contains either `<` or `>` indicating the direction the pinball should move.
   - The pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction until it leaves the grid.
   - We need to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Given Code Overview:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` seems to be a helper function but is not used correctly in the context of the problem.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input string and calculates the time for each starting position.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` initializes some lists and accumulates values based on the direction of the cells.
   - It uses a loop to process each cell from right to left.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on whether the cell contains `>` or `<`.

4. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Handling the boundary conditions (pinball leaving the grid).

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `func_2` Logic:
- **Initialization:**
  - `pre` is a list of indices where the direction is `>`.
  - `totalOne` counts the number of `>` directions.
  - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of `pre`.
  - `suffZero` is a list to keep track of the cumulative sum of positions where the direction is `<`.

- **Loop through the string in reverse:**
  - For each cell, it checks if the direction is `>` or `<`.
  - If the direction is `>`, it calculates the time using the precomputed values.
  - If the direction is `<`, it updates the `suffZero` list and recalculates the time.

- **Time Calculation:**
  - The time calculation seems to involve complex arithmetic operations based on the precomputed values, which might not be directly related to the problem's requirements.

### Testing and Validation:
To validate the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Example Test Case:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  3
  ><<
  4
  <<<<
  6
  <><<<<
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3 6 5 
  1 2 3 4 
  1 4 7 10 8 1 
  ```

### Conclusion:
- The provided code does not seem to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The use of `func_1` and the complex arithmetic operations in `func_2` do not align with the problem's requirements.
- The expected output does not match the provided code's output for the given examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
