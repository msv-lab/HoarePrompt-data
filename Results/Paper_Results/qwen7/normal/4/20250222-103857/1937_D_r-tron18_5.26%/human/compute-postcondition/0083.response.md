Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is now `preOne` without its last element, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` depending on whether `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`.**

The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the `preOne` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` will be recalculated based on the updated `preOne` and `suffZero` lists, considering the condition `ol <= zr`.
