Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and the functions `func_1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop runs in reverse from `n - 1` to `0`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `el` is `s1[n - 2]`
   - `suffZero` is a list
   - `ol` is `totalOne`
   - `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`
   - `preOne` is updated by removing the last element
   - `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`
   - `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on certain conditions
   - `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, the next value of `i` should be `n - 3`.
   - `el` will be `s1[n - 3]`.
   - `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `totalOne` remain the same as they are not directly modified in the loop head.
   - `zeroInd` and `oneInd` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` and `el`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**
