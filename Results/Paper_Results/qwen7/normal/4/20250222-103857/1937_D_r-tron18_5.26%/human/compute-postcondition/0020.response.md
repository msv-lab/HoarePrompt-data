Output State: **`ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, `i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code assigns a value to `ans[i]` based on the expressions involving `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `fi`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `i` is `n - 2`, and the other variables retain their initial values.
