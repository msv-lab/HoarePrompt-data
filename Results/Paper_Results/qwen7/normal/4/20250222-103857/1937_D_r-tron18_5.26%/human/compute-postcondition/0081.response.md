Postcondition: `i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`. If `ol` is less than or equal to `zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, making `ans[i]` equal to `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is adjusted by subtracting `fi` where `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` becomes `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.
