### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave a grid based on the direction (`<` or `>`) of each cell. The pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the directions, inverting the direction at each step until it leaves the grid.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function computes the difference between the last element of a list `arr` and an element at a specific index adjusted by `times`.
   - It ensures that the index is within bounds using `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)`.
   - This function is used to calculate indices for other parts of the logic in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - Initializes `pre` with indices where the direction is `>` and calculates `totalOne` (number of `>`).
   - Uses `accumulate` to create `preOne`, which accumulates the indices of `>` directions.
   - Initializes `suffZero` to store cumulative sums of distances for `<` directions.
   - Iterates backward through the string `s1` to calculate the time for each cell to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current direction is `>` or `<`, it uses different logic to compute the time:
     - For `>`: It calculates the distance to the nearest `0` (indicating a `<` direction) and adjusts based on the accumulated values.
     - For `<`: It calculates the distance to the nearest `1` (indicating a `>` direction) and adjusts similarly.
   - The calculations ensure that the pinball's movement and direction inversion are correctly accounted for.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it constructs the necessary data structures and calculates the time for each cell to leave the grid.
   - The logic in `func_2` appears to correctly handle the movement and direction inversion rules, ensuring the pinball eventually leaves the grid.

5. **Verification**:
   - The example provided matches the expected behavior of the program.
   - The calculations in `func_2` seem to correctly account for the movement and direction changes.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
