Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `ol` and `zr` directly from the expressions `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
