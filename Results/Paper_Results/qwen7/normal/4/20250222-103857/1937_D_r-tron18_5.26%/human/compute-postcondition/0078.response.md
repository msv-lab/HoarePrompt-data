Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `ol` and `zr` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain the same. All other variables are also unchanged except for `oneInd`, which is now reduced by the value of `func_1(preOne, 1)`.
