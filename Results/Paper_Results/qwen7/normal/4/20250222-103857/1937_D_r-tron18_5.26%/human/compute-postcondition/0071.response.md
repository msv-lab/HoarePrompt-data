Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `el` is assigned the value of `s1[i]`**.

This means that the value of `el` has been updated to be the character at index `i` in the string `s1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
