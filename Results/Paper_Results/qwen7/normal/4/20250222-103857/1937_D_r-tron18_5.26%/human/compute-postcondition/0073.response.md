Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is recalculated, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` updates the value of `zeroInd` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `suffZero` and `ol`, and then multiplying the result by 2. The values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `oneInd`, and their relationships remain unchanged except for `zeroInd`, which is now set to `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
