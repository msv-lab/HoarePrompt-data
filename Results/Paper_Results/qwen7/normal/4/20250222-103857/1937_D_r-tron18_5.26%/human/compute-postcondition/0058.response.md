Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `el` is now `s1[i]`**.

Explanation:
- The line `suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)` appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. This new value is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i` plus 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
