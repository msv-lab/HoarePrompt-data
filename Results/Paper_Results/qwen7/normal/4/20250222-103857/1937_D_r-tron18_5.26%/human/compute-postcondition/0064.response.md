Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * (preOne[-2])`, `el` is now `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1**.

Explanation:
- The line `oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]` updates the value of `oneInd` to be twice the last element of `preOne`. Since `preOne` was updated by removing the last element before this line, the last element of `preOne` is now the second-to-last element of `preOne` before the removal. Thus, `oneInd` is set to `2 * preOne[-2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state as no operation was performed on them.
