Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**

Explanation:
- The code updates `ans[i]` to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.

The specific values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are maintained as per their definitions before the operation, and `ans[i]` is calculated using these values.
