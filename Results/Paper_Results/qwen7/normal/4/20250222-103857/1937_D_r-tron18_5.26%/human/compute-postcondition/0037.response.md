Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. Since `i` was initially `n - 2`, the value of `ans[i]` is now determined by the expression `zeroInd - oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
