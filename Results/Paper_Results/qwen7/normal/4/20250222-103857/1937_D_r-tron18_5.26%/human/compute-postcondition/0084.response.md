Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated, `ol` is now `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is now `preOne` without its last element, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` depending on whether `totalOne - 1` is less than or equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `totalOne` being reduced by 1, while all other variables retain their original relationships and values as described.
