Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`, `suffZero` is a list with the last element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `oneInd` to be twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
