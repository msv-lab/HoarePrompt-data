Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `el` is `s1[n - 2]`**

Explanation: The code `el = s1[i]` assigns the value of `s1[i]` to the variable `el`. Given that `i` is initially `n - 1`, after executing the line, `i` is decremented by 1 (becoming `n - 2`). The value of `el` is set to the element at index `i` in the list `s1`, which is `s1[n - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
