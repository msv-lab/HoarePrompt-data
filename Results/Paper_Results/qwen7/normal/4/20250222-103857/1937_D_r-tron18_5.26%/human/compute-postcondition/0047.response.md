Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `el` is `s1[n - 3]`, `suffZero` is a list, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is updated by removing the last element, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**, `el` is now `s1[i]`.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` to `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` and `el` are also unchanged except that `el` is now `s1[i]` due to the update in the initial state description.
