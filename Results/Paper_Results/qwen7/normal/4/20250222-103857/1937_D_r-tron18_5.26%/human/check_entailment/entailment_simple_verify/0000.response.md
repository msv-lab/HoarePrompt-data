### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(arr, times):
    l = len(arr)
    return arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]
```
- This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-l, -1 - times)`.
- The purpose of this function is unclear from the context, as it doesn't seem to directly relate to the problem of simulating the pinball movement.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        
        if el == '>':
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        
    print(*ans)
```

- `pre` stores the positions of cells with '>'.
- `totalOne` counts the number of such positions.
- `preOne` is a prefix sum array for `pre`.
- `suffZero` keeps track of the cumulative sum of distances to the right boundary for cells with '<'.
- `ans` is initialized to store the results for each query.

The main loop iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid based on the current character and the accumulated values.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Inversion Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle the inversion of characters as described in the problem statement. The inversion logic is missing.
2. **Movement Calculation**: The calculation of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` does not accurately reflect the movement and inversion logic required by the problem.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program does not correctly handle the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the pinball movement and inversion logic as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly simulate the pinball movement according to the problem description.

**Final: False**
