Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer is the index (i + 1) of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
