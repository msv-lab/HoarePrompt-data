Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Condition Checking**: 
   - The condition `if b == c:` is correct for determining if the number of moves results in the exact number of cubes.
   - However, the condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect because it implies that it's impossible to have more cubes than moves, which is not true. For example, if `b = 2` and `c = 3`, it's possible to add 1 cube twice and remove 1 cube once to end up with 3 cubes.
   - The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` checks if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It ensures that the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which is a prerequisite for the solution but does not cover all cases where `b` and `c` can be achieved through the allowed operations.

2. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even (since each operation changes the number of cubes by 1, the difference must be even).
   - Additionally, `b` should be greater than or equal to `c` because you cannot have more cubes than moves.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Given the above analysis, the original function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
