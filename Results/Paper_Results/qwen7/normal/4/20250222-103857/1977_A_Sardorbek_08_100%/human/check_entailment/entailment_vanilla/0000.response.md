Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func()` reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times to process each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES' because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means he just added all the cubes without removing any.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'. This condition seems to be checking if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which is necessary but not sufficient.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, let's consider the logic:

- **Case 1:** `b == c`
  - If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's trivially possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves by adding all cubes.
  - Correctly handled by printing 'YES'.

- **Case 2:** `b < c`
  - It's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
  - Correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

- **Case 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2`
  - This condition checks if the number of additions and removals results in the same parity for the final count of cubes. However, this alone is not sufficient.
  - For example, if `b = 3` and `c = 2`, `b % 2 == c % 2` holds true (both are odd), but it's impossible to have 2 cubes after 3 moves since you can only add or remove one cube at a time.
  - This condition should be combined with another check to ensure the exact number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes.

### Example Test Cases

- **Test Case 1:** `3 3`
  - `b = 3`, `c = 3`
  - `3 % 2 == 3 % 2` is true, and `b == c`, so the output is 'YES'.
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 2:** `2 4`
  - `b = 2`, `c = 4`
  - `2 < 4`, so the output is 'NO'.
  - Correct.

- **Test Case 3:** `5 3`
  - `b = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `5 % 2 == 3 % 2` is false, so the output is 'NO'.
  - Correct.

### Conclusion

The program does handle the basic conditions correctly, but the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is insufficient on its own. It needs to be combined with ensuring the exact number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes. However, the provided solution does not fully address this requirement.

### Final Answer

Given the analysis, the program does not fully meet the requirements as stated. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
