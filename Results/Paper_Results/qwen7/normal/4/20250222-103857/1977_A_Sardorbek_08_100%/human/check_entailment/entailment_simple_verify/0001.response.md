### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not fully meet the requirements due to the insufficient condition `b % 2 == c % 2`. Specifically, this condition alone does not guarantee that the number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes. 

However, the program does handle the basic conditions correctly:
1. If `b == c`, it prints 'YES', which is correct.
2. If `b < c`, it prints 'NO', which is also correct.
3. The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is intended to check if the parity matches, but it needs to be combined with a check to ensure the exact number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes.

Given the example test cases provided:
- **Test Case 1:** `3 3` → Correctly outputs 'YES'.
- **Test Case 2:** `2 4` → Correctly outputs 'NO'.
- **Test Case 3:** `5 3` → Incorrectly outputs 'NO' when it should output 'YES'.

The program fails to correctly handle the case where `b > c` and the parity matches, as seen in the third test case. The correct approach would be to check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, and then verify if the number of moves can result in the desired number of cubes.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the program does not fully meet the requirements as stated. Therefore:

Final: **False**
