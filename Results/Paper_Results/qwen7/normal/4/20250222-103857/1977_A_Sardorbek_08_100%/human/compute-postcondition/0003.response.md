Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer entered, `c` is the second integer entered, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.**

Explanation: The code `q = b, c` assigns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` to the variable `q`. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
