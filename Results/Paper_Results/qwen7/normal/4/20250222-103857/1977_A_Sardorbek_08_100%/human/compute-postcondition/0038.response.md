Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`, `b` is converted to an integer, `c` is converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `q`, `b`, and `c` are updated accordingly. The initial values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `q`, and the original forms of `b` and `c` are preserved, while `b` and `c` are now integers.
