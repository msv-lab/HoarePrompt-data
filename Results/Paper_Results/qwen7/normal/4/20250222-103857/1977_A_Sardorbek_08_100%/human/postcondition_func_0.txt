The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `b` and `c`. It checks if `b` equals `c`, if `b` is less than `c`, if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on these conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
