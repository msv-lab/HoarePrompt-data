Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not match the problem statement and the expected logic.
2. The program should check if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
3. The current implementation checks if `b == c` (which means `n == m`) directly, which is not sufficient. It also incorrectly handles the parity (even/odd nature) of `b` and `c`.
4. To solve this correctly, we need to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) results in no net change in the number of cubes.
5. If `n - m` is even, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves; otherwise, it is not possible.

Given these points, the annotated program is incorrect. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `_` is an input integer, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split. The program correctly checks if `(n - m)` is even, which determines if it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
```

Correctness: **False**
