Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a` (the total number of iterations), `b` is the last integer from the input split, `c` is the last integer from the input split, and `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`. Regardless of the conditions inside the loop, the value of `q` remains unchanged after all iterations.
