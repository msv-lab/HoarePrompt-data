Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `b` is an integer.
- `c` is an integer.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd).

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
