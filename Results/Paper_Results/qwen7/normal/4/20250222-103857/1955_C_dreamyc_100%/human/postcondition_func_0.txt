The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers. The function checks if the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `k`. If true, it returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates two thresholds `a` and `b` based on `k`, then iterates through the list `nums` to count how many times the sum of the first half of the list (or its largest possible part) and the sum of the second half of the list (or its largest possible part) satisfy their respective conditions. Finally, it returns this count, which is guaranteed to be equal to `n` under the given conditions.
