    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is `n`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the last `n // 2 + 1` elements if `n` is odd), `i` is `n - 1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `n // 2` elements of `nums` (or the sum of the first `n // 2 - 1` elements if `n` is odd).
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n - 1`. The variable `s_a` accumulates the sum of the first half of the list `nums` (or the first half minus one element if `n` is odd), and `s_b` accumulates the sum of the second half of the list `nums` (or the second half plus one element if `n` is odd). The variable `ans` is incremented each time either `s_a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to their respective thresholds `a` and `b`. Since the loop iterates over all elements of `nums`, `ans` will be equal to `n` if every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half satisfy their conditions.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is equal to `n` because every prefix sum of the first half and the suffix sum of the second half of the list `nums` satisfied their respective conditions during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers. The function checks if the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `k`. If true, it returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates two thresholds `a` and `b` based on `k`, then iterates through the list `nums` to count how many times the sum of the first half of the list (or its largest possible part) and the sum of the second half of the list (or its largest possible part) satisfy their respective conditions. Finally, it returns this count, which is guaranteed to be equal to `n` under the given conditions.
