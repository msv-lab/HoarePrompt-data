Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is the sum of 1 for every element in `nums` that makes the corresponding `s_a` or `s_b` less than or equal to `a` or `b`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `min(i+1, n-i-1)` elements of `nums` (where `i` is the last iteration index), `i` is `n-1`, `s_a` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-1`, meaning the loop has processed all elements in `nums`. The variable `ans` will be incremented each time either `s_a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to `a` or `b`, respectively. `s_a` will be the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums`, and `s_b` will be the sum of the last `min(i+1, n-i-1)` elements of `nums`.
