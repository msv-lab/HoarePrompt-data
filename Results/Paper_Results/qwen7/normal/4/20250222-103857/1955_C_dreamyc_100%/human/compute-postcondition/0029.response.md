Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 3, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - 2]`, `i` is 4, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[3]` if `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`**

Explanation: The line `s_a += nums[i]` increments `s_a` by the value of `nums[i]`. Since `i` was initially 3, it is now 4. The condition for updating `s_a` is that `s_a` should be less than or equal to `a`. If this condition holds true, `s_a` will be updated to include the value of `nums[3]`. If not, `s_a` remains unchanged as `nums[0] + nums[1]`.
