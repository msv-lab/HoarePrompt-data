Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. If the condition is true, `k` becomes 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `y` is `n - 1 - i`. If the condition is false, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 2)`, and `y` is `n - 2 - i`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
