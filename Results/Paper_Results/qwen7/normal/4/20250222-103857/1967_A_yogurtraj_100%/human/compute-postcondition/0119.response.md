Output State: **`rem` is `k % 3`, `i` is 1, `n` is `n - 1`, `k` is reduced by `2 * (a[1] - a[0])`, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `y` is assigned the value of `n - 1 - i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `y` becomes `n - 1 - 2` which simplifies to `n - 3`. However, since the value of `n` itself is not directly updated in the code, we keep it as `n - 1` in the output state to indicate that `n` has effectively decreased by 1 due to the calculation of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
