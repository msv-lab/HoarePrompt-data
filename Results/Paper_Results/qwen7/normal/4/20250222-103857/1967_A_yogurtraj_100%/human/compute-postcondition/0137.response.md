Postcondition: **`rem` is either `k % (n - 1)` or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or fully reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations, `r` is either `a[n - 2] + k // (n - 1)` or `a[n - 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met for some `i`, and `y` is 0. The current value of `k` is not 0.**
