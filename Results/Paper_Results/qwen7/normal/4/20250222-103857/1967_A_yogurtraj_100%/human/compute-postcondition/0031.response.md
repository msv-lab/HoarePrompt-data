Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, which is `3 + 1 = 4`. So, `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 4`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
