Postcondition: `rem` is either `k % (n - 1)` or 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is `n - (n - 1) = 0`, `k` is either 0 or fully reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations, `r` is either `a[n - 2] + k // (n - 1)` or `a[n - 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met for some `i`, `y` is 0, and the current value of `k` is not 0.
