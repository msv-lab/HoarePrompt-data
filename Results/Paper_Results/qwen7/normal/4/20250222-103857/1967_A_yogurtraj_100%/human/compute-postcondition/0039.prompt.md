Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is updated based on whether the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true or false. If the condition is true, `k` becomes 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is updated based on the condition: if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged; otherwise, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value. `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false, otherwise `r` is set to `a[3] + 0 // 4` and `rem` is `0 % 4`, `y` is `n - 2`, and `k` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
