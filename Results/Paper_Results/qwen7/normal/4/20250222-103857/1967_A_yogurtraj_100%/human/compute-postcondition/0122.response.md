Output State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`**.

Explanation: 
- The initial state had `rem` as 0, `i` as 1, `n` greater than 1, and `k` reduced by `2 * (a[1] - a[0])`.
- The code updates `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Since `i` was initially 1, after the operation `i` becomes 2. So, `k` is now reduced by `(2 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, which simplifies to `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
