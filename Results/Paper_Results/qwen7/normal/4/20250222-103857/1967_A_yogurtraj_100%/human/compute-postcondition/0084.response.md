Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, otherwise `k` is 0, `r` is either `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is either `k % (i + 1)` or 0, `y` is either `n - 1 - i` or `n - 2 - i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
