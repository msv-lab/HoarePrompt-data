Output State: **`rem` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Since `i` is 0, `r` is assigned the value of `a[1]`. The values of `rem`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
