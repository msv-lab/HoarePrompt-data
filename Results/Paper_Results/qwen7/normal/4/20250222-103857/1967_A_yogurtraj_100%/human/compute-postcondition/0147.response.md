Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each test case within `t`, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive and `k` is between 0 and 10^12 inclusive. Additionally, it accepts a list `a` containing `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^12 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the input parameters.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases defined by `t`. For each test case, it uses `n`, `k`, and the list `a` to compute and return some result, though the specific computation is not detailed here.
