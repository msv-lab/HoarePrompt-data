Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false, otherwise `i` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
