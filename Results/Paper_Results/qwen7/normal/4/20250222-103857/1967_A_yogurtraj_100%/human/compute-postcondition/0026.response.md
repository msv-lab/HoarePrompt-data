Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value, `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Here, `i` is 2, so `r` becomes `a[3]`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is used to update `k`, but since the actual value of `k` before the operation is not given, we only note that `k` is updated by subtracting this expression from its original value.
