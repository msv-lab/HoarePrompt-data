Output State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `a` is a list of integers, `k` is reduced by \(((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))\), `r` is \(a[i + 1] + 0 // (i + 2)\), `rem` is \(0 \% (i + 2)\), `y` is \(n - 2 - i\)**

Explanation: The code updates `k` by subtracting \(((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))\). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now \(i + 1\). The value of `k` is reduced by the specified amount, while `r`, `rem`, and `y` retain their initial values.
