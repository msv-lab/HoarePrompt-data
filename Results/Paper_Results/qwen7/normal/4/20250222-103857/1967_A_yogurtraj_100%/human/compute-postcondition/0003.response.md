Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` itself (now sorted) are updated. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `n` and `k` are input integers remains unchanged. The list `a` now contains its elements sorted.
