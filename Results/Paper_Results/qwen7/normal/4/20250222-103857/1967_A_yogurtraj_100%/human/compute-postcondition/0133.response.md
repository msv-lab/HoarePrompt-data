Output State: **`rem` is either `k % 3` or 0, `i` is either 2 or 4, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]), n` is `n - 1` and must still be greater than 1, and `r` is now `a[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. The values of `rem`, `i`, `k`, `n`, and the condition that `n` must still be greater than 1 remain unchanged from the initial state.
