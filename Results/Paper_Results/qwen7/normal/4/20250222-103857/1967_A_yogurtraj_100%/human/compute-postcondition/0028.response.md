Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is updated based on the condition: if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged; otherwise, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value. `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` is 0.**
