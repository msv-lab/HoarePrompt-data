The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the list \( a \) and calculates a final value \( r \) based on the values in \( a \) and the integer \( k \). It then prints the result of the calculation, which depends on whether \( k \) is zero or not. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final results for each case.
