Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `A` is sorted, as per the initial state description.
