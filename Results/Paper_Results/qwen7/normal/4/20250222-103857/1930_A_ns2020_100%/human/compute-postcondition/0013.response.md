The loop condition in this case is `t`, which is a non-zero value between -1 and 4998 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain non-zero.

Given that `t` is a non-zero value at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `t` remains non-zero for the next iteration. Since `t` is already non-zero, no adjustment is necessary for `t` itself. However, we should note that `t` must remain non-zero.

Therefore, the state does not need any modification as `t` is already in a valid state to continue the loop.

State: **`t` is a non-zero value between -1 and 4998 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers**
