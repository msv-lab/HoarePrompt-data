Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score according to the given rules. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the array `A` of integers in ascending order.
3. **Scoring Logic**: It then calculates the score by summing every other element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.). This effectively pairs the smallest elements together, which maximizes the score since the minimum of each pair contributes to the score.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated score for each test case.

This approach ensures that the score is maximized because the smallest available numbers are paired together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program correctly computes the maximum possible score for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
