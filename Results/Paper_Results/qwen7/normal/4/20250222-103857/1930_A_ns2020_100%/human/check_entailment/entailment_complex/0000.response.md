Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and the `2n` integers from the input.

2. **Sorting the List**: The list `A` is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we take the minimum of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are consecutive elements in the sorted list, we are always taking the smaller of the two numbers. This maximizes the sum of the minimums, which is the goal of the problem.

3. **Summing Every Second Element**: The program calculates the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A[::2]`. This corresponds to selecting the minimum of each pair `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are consecutive elements in the sorted list, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated sum for each test case and decrements `t` until it reaches zero, ensuring all test cases are processed.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
