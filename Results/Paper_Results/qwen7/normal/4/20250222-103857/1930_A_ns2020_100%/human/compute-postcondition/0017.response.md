Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero value between -1 and 4998 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `A[::2]`:**
   - `A[::2]` means taking every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).

2. **Summing the Elements:**
   - `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

3. **Output Description:**
   - Since `A` is a sorted list of integers, `A[::2]` will include the first, third, fifth, etc., elements of the list `A`.
   - The sum of these elements will be computed and printed.

Given the precondition does not specify the exact values of `A`, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `A`.

Output: **the sum of every second element in the sorted list A**
