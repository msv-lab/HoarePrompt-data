You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because the loop condition `while t:` checks if `t` is non-zero. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop terminates. The values of `n` and `A` will be as they were set in the last iteration of the loop, since these variables are defined inside the loop and are not affected by the loop's termination condition.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that we add \(\min(x, y)\) to our score.
   - We must do this exactly \(n\) times, where \(2n\) integers are initially present on the board.
   - To achieve the maximum score, we should always choose the smallest available integers to minimize the loss in score when erasing them.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then prints the sum of every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`), which effectively sums up the smallest half of the elements.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - By sorting the array and summing every other element starting from the first, we ensure that we are always adding the smaller of the paired elements.
   - This strategy guarantees that we are maximizing the score because we are always choosing the smallest available integers to pair together.
   - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the sum of every other element starting from the first is \(1 + 3 = 4\). This is equivalent to pairing `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)` and adding the minimums, resulting in a score of \(1 + 3 = 4\).

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case: `2 3`. Sorting gives `[2, 3]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `2`.
   - For the second test case: `1 1 2 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Sum of every other element starting from the first is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

Since the solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score, the given program is correct.
