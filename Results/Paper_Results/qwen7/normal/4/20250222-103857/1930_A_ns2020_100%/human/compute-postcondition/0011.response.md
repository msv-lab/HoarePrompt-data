Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a non-zero value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.

The code snippet `print(sum(A[::2]))` will print the sum of every second element in the list `A`.

To break it down further:
- `A[::2]` means taking every second element starting from the first element (index 0).

Since the exact values of `A` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical sum. However, we know that the sum will be the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

Output: **sum of every second element in the list A**
