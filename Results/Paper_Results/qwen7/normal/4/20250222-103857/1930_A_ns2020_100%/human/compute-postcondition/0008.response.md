Output State: **`t` is a non-zero value between 0 and 4999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial states of `t` and `A`.
