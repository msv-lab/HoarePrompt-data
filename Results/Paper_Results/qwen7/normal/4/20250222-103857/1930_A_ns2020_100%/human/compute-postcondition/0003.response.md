Output State: **`t` is a value between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `A` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a list `A` from these converted integers. The variable `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
