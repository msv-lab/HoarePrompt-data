Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `n` is the length of this list minus 1.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
   - `minn` is infinity.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect that `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**
