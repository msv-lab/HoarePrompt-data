Postcondition: **The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, and `i` is less than or equal to `n` and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`.**
