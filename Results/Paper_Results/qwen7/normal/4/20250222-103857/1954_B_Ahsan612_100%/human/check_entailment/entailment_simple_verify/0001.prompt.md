You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `minn` will hold the minimum value of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array `ar`. `same` will be 1 because it is reset to 1 at the start of each new sequence of identical elements. `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`, indicating that the entire array has been processed. `num` will be the last element of the array `ar` that was checked before the loop ended. If `minn` was never updated during the loop or was set to infinity initially, `minn` will still be infinity. Otherwise, `minn` will be the smallest value among the lengths of sequences of consecutive identical elements found in the array.
    #
    #The output will be `-1` if `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the array, indicating that there are no sequences of consecutive identical elements. Otherwise, the output will be the value of `minn`, which is the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence of consecutive identical elements (`same`), the number currently being tracked (`num`), and the minimum length of such sequences (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array, updating these variables as it encounters sequences of identical elements.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for identifying the minimum length of sequences of identical elements seems correct.
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements also appears correct.
   - However, there are a few potential issues:
     - The program assumes that the array is already beautiful, which is stated in the problem constraints but should be explicitly checked within the code.
     - The program does not handle the case where the array has only one unique element correctly. In such a case, the array is already non-beautiful, and no removals are needed.

4. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - If the array consists of a single unique element repeated throughout, the program incorrectly prints `-1`. This is because the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements is the length of the array itself, which triggers the `-1` condition.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but fails to handle the edge case where the array consists of a single unique element. Therefore, the program needs to be adjusted to handle this specific scenario correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
Add a check at the beginning of the function to handle the case where the array has only one unique element:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        # Check if the array has only one unique element
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
        elif minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

This fix ensures that the program handles the edge case correctly.
