Output State: `same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the last element of the list `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value found among all sequences of consecutive elements in `ar` that are equal to `num`.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`, meaning the loop has processed every element in the list. The variable `same` will hold the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `num`. The variable `minn` will store the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution, which represents the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `num`.
