Output State: **`i` is 5, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, the number of iterations left is 0, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `same` to 1. This changes the value of `same` from its previous state (either 2 or 1) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
