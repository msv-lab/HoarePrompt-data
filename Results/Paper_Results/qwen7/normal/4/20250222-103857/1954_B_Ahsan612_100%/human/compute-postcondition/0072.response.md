Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The conditions regarding the element at index `i` in `ar` (not equal to `num`) and `i` being less than `n` remain unchanged because the code does not modify these conditions directly. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and retains the original conditions.
