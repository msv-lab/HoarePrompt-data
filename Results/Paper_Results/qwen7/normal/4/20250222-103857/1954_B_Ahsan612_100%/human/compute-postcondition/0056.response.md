Output State: **The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` was initially set to 1 and is now incremented by 1, making its value 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
