Output State: **`minn` is 1, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 2, `i` is 7, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given that `i` is 7, `num` is now set to the 8th element in the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
