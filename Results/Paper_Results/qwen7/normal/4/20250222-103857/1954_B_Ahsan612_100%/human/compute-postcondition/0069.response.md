Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, the element at index `i` in `ar` is now equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`; `same` is 1; `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1, the element at index `i` in `ar` is now equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`; `same` is set to 1; and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
