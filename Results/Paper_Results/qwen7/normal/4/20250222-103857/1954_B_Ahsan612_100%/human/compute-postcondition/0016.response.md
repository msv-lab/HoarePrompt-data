Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `same = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged.
