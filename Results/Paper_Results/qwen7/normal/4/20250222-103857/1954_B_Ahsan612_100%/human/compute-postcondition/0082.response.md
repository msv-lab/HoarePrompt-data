Output State: The number of iterations left is 0, `n` is the length of the list `ar` minus 1, `same` is the final count of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` found during the loop execution, and `i` is equal to `n + 1`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, there will be no more iterations left (`i` will be equal to or greater than the length of the list), `n` will be the original length of the list minus one, `same` will hold the total count of consecutive occurrences of the initial number `num`, `minn` will be the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `i` will be one position beyond the last element of the list.
