Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the array), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it finds the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the array \( a \). If no such sequence exists, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest such sequence.**
