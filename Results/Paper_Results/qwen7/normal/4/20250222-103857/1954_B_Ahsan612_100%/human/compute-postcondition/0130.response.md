Output: **-1**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1. Since `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, it must be greater than 1. Therefore, the minimum value between `minn` and 1 would be 1. However, this does not change the value of `minn` itself. The value of `same` is explicitly given as 1. The value of `i` is the length of the list `ar`. The value of `num` is the last element checked before the loop ends, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement. The print statement simply outputs `-1`, so that is what will be printed.
