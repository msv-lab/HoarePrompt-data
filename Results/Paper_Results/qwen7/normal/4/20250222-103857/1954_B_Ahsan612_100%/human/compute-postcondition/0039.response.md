Output State: `same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` (or the first element if no other elements match `num`), and `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop execution.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`, indicating that the loop has processed every element in the list. The variable `same` will hold the highest count of consecutive occurrences of any single integer in the list `ar`. The variable `minn` will store the smallest value of `same` found during the loop's execution, which represents the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the list.
