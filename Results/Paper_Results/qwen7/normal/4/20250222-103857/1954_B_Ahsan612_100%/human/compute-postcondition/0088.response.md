Based on the initial state provided:

- The number of iterations left is 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `ar` minus 1.
- `same` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list.
- `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1.
- `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity and is also not equal to the length of `ar`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(minn)` is executed.

From the information given:
- `minn` is explicitly stated to be a value that is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar`. This means `minn` must be a finite integer value that is part of the list `ar` starting from index 1.
- Since `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, it represents the smallest element in the sublist of `ar` starting from index 1 to the end of the list.

Therefore, the print statement will output the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value found in the list ar starting from index 1)**
