Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The logic implemented in the program is as follows:

1. It iterates through the array to find the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
2. It keeps track of the length of these sequences using the variable `same`.
3. When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, and resets `same` to 1.
4. After processing the entire array, it checks if `minn` is still infinity (`inf`) or equal to the length of the array (`len(ar)`). If so, it means there were no sequences of consecutive identical elements, and thus the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. In this case, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the length of the shortest sequence found.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the last sequence of identical elements. The program should also update `minn` with the length of the last sequence after the loop ends.

To ensure correctness, the final step should be:
```python
minn = min(minn, same)
```
right before printing the result.

Since the current implementation seems to cover the main logic correctly but might miss updating `minn` with the last sequence length, the program is almost correct but needs a small adjustment.

Correctness: **False**
