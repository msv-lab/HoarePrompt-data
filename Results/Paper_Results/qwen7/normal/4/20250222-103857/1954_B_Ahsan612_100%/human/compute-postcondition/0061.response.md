Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is the element at index 2 in `ar`, `i` is 3, and `i` is less than or equal to `n` and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `same` to 1, which was already 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `same` remains unchanged. All other conditions and variable values remain the same as the initial state.
