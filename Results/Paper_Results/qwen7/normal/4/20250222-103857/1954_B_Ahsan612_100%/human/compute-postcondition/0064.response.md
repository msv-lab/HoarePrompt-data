Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `len(ar)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `n` is the length of this list minus 1.
- `same` indicates whether the first element `num` appears consecutively.
- `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`.

To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `n` is the length of the list minus 1, `len(ar)` is `n + 1`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `i < n`.

The state at the end of the previous iteration already tells us that `i` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`. This means `i` is now `i + 1`.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` (which is now `i + 1`) is still less than `n`.

State: **`total` is not specified, `i` is incremented by 1 and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`**
