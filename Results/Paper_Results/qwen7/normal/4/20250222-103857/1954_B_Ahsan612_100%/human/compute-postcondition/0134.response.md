Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `minn` will hold the minimum value of the longest sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the array `ar`. `same` will be 1 because the loop has ended, indicating it has processed the entire array. `i` will be equal to `len(ar)` since the while loop has completed its execution. `num` will be the last element of the array `ar` that was checked during the last iteration of the while loop. `t` will remain an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) as it was initialized before the loop. `n` will be the length of the array `ar`, and `ar` itself will be the list of integers provided as input. If `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the array `ar`, the output will be `-1`. Otherwise, the output will be the value of `minn`.

This means that after processing all the inputs, the program will either print the smallest sequence length of repeated numbers or `-1` if no such sequence exists.
