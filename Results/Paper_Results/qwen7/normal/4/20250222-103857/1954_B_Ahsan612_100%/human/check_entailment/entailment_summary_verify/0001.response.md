### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence of consecutive identical elements (`same`), the number currently being tracked (`num`), and the minimum length of such sequences (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array, updating these variables as it encounters sequences of identical elements.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for identifying the minimum length of sequences of identical elements seems correct.
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements also appears correct.
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of sequences of identical elements and handles the case where no such sequences exist.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the array has only one unique element, printing `-1` in such cases.

4. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - The program correctly identifies the edge case where the array has only one unique element and prints `-1` as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It handles all edge cases appropriately, including the case where the array has only one unique element.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
