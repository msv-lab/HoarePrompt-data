Postcondition: `total` is not specified, `i` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `i` in `ar` is not equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`. If the element at index `i` in `ar` equals `num`, then `same` is 1 and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`. Otherwise, `same` remains unchanged.
