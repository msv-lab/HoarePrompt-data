Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, the element at index `i` in `ar` is now equal to `num`, and `i` must be less than `n`; `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and the variable `same`. The other variables (`i`, `ar`, `num`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
