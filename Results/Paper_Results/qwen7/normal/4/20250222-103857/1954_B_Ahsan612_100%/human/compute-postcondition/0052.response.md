Output State: **The number of iterations left is the new list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the length of this list minus 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `minn` is infinity.**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` assigns the value of infinity to the variable `minn`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the initial state values for `number of iterations left`, `n`, `same`, `num`, and the list `ar` remain unchanged.
