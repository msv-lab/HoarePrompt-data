Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `d` is an input string**.

The code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `d`. Since no type conversion is applied, `d` will hold the string input provided by the user. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
