Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `d = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `d`. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states.
