Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is an integer input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 3, `k` is the index of `d[2]` in `e` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` updates the value of `k`. Since `j` is 3, `d[j]` is `d[3]`. The value of `k` is set to the index of `d[3]` in the string `e` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
