Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; a is an integer input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All indices `j` in the range of `b` have been iterated over, and for each `j`, `k` has been updated based on whether `d[j]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`. If `d[j]` is found, `k` is set to the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in `e[k:]`; otherwise, `k` retains its last value before breaking out of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is the previous value of `i` + the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is `b`, and `k` is either `b` or the index of `d[b-1]` in `e` plus 1 (if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`), and in both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be incremented by the total number of times the loop ran, `j` will be equal to `b` (the upper limit of the `range(b)`), and `k` will be either `b` itself or the position in string `e` where `d[b-1]` is found plus one, provided that either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. If neither condition is met, `k` will be set to `b`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` must be greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is either `e.index(d[2]) + 3` if `d[2]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]` and the conditions `k == c` or `j == b - 1` are met, or `k` is 3 if `d[2]` is not found or the conditions are not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
