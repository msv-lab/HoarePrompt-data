Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input after splitting, `c` is the second integer input after splitting.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `b` and `c`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 0 as per the initial state.
