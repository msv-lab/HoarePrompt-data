Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user**.

This means that the variable `e` is assigned the value of a string input from the user, while the values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged from their previous states.
