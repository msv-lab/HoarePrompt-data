Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 1, `k` is `j` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value of `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 0 (from the initial state), `k` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
