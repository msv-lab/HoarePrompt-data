Output State: **`b` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `k` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `k` was being updated from `j + 1`. Since `j` is 0, `k` becomes 1. The values of `b` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition `either k equals c or j equals b - 1` is no longer relevant since we have exited the loop or conditional block.
