Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and the constant `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range `range(b)`. This means `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `b-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is a list.
   - `j` is an index within the range of `d`.
   - `e` is a list.
   - If the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` holds true, `d[j]` remains unchanged and is still present at index `k` in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of the list.
   - If the condition does not hold, `d[j]` is not in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` is equal to `j`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` in the range `range(b)`, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1` (assuming the loop has not exited prematurely).
   - The value of `b` remains unchanged.
   - The conditions mentioned in the postcondition must be checked for the new value of `j`.

Given the above points, let's formulate the state for the start of the next iteration:

- If `j` was the last index (`b - 1`), then `j` will remain `b - 1` and the loop will exit.
- Otherwise, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d` that is `j + 1` (if `j < b - 1`), and `e` is a list.**

If `j` reaches `b - 1`, the loop will exit, and `j` will remain `b - 1`.

So, the final state can be represented as:

**State: **`d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d` that is `j + 1` (if `j < b - 1`), and `e` is a list. If `j` reaches `b - 1`, `j` remains `b - 1`.**
