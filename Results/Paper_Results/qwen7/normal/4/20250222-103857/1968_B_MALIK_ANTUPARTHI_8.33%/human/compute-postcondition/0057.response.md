Postcondition: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 1, `k` is `j` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, `j` is set to `j + 1` and `k` is set to `k + 1`. Otherwise, `j` is reset to 0 and `k` is reset to 0.**
