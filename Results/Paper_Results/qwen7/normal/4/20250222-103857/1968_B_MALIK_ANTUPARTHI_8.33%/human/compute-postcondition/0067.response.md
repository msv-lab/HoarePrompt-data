Postcondition: `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 2, and `k` is either updated to the index of `d[2]` in `e` plus 1 (if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`) or remains 2 (otherwise).
