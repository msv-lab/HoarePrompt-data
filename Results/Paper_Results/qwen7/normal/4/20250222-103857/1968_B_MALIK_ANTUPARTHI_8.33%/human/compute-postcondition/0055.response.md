Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 0, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the given code, the only effect is that we break out of the implied context. All other variables retain their previous values.
