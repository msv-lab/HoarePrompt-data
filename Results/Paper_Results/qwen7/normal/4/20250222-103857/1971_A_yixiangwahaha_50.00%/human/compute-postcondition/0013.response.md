Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is the list `xylist` with the first element converted to an integer appended to it; `y` is the list `x` with the second element converted to an integer appended to it; `i` is `k + 2` and the first element of `x` is an integer, the second element of `x` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` reads an input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on the space delimiter. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, or `i`. However, it updates `xylist` to a list of strings. Afterward, `x` is updated to include the first element of `xylist` converted to an integer, and `y` is updated to include the second element of `x` converted to an integer. The value of `i` remains `k + 2` and the first element of `x` is confirmed to be an integer.
