Postcondition: `xylist` is a list of strings split from the input, `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`, `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`, `i` is 0, and if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, the condition remains unchanged; otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.
