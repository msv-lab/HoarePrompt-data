Based on the initial state provided:

- `xylist` is a list of strings, where each string is a pair of values separated by a space.
- `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each string in `xylist`.
- `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each string in `xylist`.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`.

Given these conditions, when the code snippet `print(x[i], ' ', y[i])` is executed:

- `x[i]` refers to the first element of the list `x`, which is the integer version of the first element of the first string in `xylist`.
- `y[i]` refers to the first element of the list `y`, which is the integer version of the second element of the first string in `xylist`.

Since `i` is 0, both `x[i]` and `y[i]` refer to the first elements of their respective lists.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first element of `x` followed by a space and then the first element of `y`.

Output: **x[0] y[0]**
