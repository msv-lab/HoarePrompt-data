### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem states that the first line contains an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. However, the provided code does not handle this correctly. Instead, it reads `t` but then proceeds to process exactly 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop `for i in range(10):` iterates 10 times, even if there are fewer than 10 test cases. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the remaining iterations will be unnecessary and could lead to undefined behavior if the input list `x` or `y` is not properly managed.

3. **Input Reading**: The code reads `t` at the beginning but then processes exactly 10 pairs of integers from the input, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem expects multiple test cases, each with its own pair of integers.

4. **Output Format**: The code prints the results in the correct format, but the issue lies in how it handles the input. If `t` is less than 10, the extra iterations in the loop will cause errors.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem requirements due to the fixed number of iterations and the mismatch between the expected input handling and the actual implementation.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
