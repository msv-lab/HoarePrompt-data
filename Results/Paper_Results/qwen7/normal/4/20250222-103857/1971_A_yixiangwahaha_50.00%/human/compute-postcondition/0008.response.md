Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is the list `xylist` with the first element converted to an integer appended to it; `y` is the list `x` with the second element converted to an integer appended to it; `i` is `k + 1`**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on the space delimiter. This operation does not change the values of `x`, `y`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
