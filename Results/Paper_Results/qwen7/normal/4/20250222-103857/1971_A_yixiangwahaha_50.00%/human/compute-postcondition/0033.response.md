Based on the initial state provided:

- `xylist` is a list of strings, where each string is a pair of values separated by a delimiter (likely a space or comma).
- `x` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`.
- `y` is a list containing 10 integers, each being the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`.
- `i` is 2.

When the code snippet `print(y[i], ' ', x[i])` is executed, it will print the element at index `i` of the list `y` followed by a space, and then the element at the same index `i` of the list `x`.

Given that `i` is 2, we need to determine the values of `y[2]` and `x[2]`.

Since `y` contains the integer version of the second element of each `xylist`, and `x` contains the integer version of the first element of each `xylist`, we need to look at the third pair of values in `xylist` to find `y[2]` and `x[2]`.

However, the exact values of `y[2]` and `x[2]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe them in terms of their positions in the lists.

Output: **y[2] x[2]**
