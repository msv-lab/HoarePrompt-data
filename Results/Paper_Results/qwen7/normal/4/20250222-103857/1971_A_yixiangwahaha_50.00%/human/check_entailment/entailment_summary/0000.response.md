Reasoning:
- The problem specifies that the input will contain 10 test cases, each with two integers.
- The provided program reads 10 pairs of integers, but it does not handle the case where the number of test cases `t` is specified in the input.
- The program assumes that there will always be exactly 10 pairs of integers, which is not aligned with the problem statement that says "the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)".
- The program correctly compares each pair of integers and prints the smaller number followed by the larger number.
- However, since the program does not read the value of `t` and processes only a fixed number of pairs (10), it will not work correctly if the actual number of test cases is different from 10.

Given these points, the program is not fully correct because it does not handle the variable number of test cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
