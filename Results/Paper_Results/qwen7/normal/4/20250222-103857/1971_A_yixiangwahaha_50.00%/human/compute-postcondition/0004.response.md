Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `xylist = input().split(' ')` takes user input and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. Since the exact input is not specified, we can only say that `xylist` is a list of strings resulting from the split operation. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
