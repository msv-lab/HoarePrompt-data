Output State: **`xylist` is a list of strings split from the input; `x` is the list `xylist` with the first element converted to an integer appended to it; `y` is the list `x` with the second element converted to an integer appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer version of the second element of `xylist` (which is now stored in `x`) to the list `y`. Since `x` is already defined as `xylist` with the first element converted to an integer appended to it, `y` is updated to include the second element of `xylist` as an integer.
