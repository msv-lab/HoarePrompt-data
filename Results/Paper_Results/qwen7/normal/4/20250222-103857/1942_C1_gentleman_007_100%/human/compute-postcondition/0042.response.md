Output State: **`q` now contains the node that was appended plus the previously appended node, `ver` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is set to 1, and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor.**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
