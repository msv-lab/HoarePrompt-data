Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element from `graph[ver]`, `vis[node]` is 1, and `q` contains the node**.

Explanation: The line `vis[node] = 1` changes the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
