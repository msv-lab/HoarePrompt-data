Output State: **`q` now contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]`, the third element in `graph[ver]`, and `node`; `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`; `vis[node]` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
