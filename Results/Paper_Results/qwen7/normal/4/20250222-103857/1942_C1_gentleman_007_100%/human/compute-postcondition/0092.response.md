Output State: **`i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it `i - 1`. The values of `j`, `dp`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
