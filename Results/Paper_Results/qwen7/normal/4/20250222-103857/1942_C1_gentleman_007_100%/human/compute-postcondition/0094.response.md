Output State: **`i` is `i-1`, `j` is `len(b)-1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` now holds the value of `len(b) - 1`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
