Postcondition: `q` now contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]` and the third element in `graph[ver]`, `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`, and `vis[node]` is now 1. If `vis[node]` is not True (i.e., `node` has not been visited), then `q` will also include `node`.
