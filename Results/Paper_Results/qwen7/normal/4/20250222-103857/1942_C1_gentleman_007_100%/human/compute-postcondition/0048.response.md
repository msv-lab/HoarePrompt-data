Based on the initial state provided:

- `ver` is the first element in `q` after applying `popleft()`. This means `ver` is the node that was removed from the leftmost position in the queue `q`.
- All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited.
- `q` contains the remaining elements (if any) after removing the first element.

The `print(ver, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `ver` followed by a space (`end=' '` ensures there is no newline).

Output: **ver (where ver is the first element in q after applying popleft())**
