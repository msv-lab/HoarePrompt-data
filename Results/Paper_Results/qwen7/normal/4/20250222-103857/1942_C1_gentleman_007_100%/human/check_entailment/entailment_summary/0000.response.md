Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, reading the number of sides of the polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, and the number of additional vertices you can choose `y`. It also correctly reads the chosen vertices and sorts them.
2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program handles edge cases where the first and last chosen vertices are adjacent (`arr[x - 1] == n - 1` and `arr[0] == 1`) or when the first and last chosen vertices are `1` and `2` respectively, which allows for an additional triangle.
3. **Counting Triangles**: The core logic of the program counts the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. It iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and checks for consecutive pairs of vertices, incrementing the count of triangles accordingly.
4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake for each test case, which matches the problem statement requirements.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent issues or discrepancies that would make the program incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
