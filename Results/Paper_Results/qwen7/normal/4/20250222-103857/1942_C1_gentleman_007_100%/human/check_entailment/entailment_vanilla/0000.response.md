Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the given vertices. The key observation here is that any convex polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
2. **Key Observation**: For a polygon with \( n \) vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is \( n - 2 \). This is because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and we need to use all \( n \) vertices exactly once.
3. **Given Constraints**: 
   - \( n \) (number of sides of the polygon) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of vertices already chosen by Bessie) ranges from 2 to \( \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \).
   - \( y \) (maximum number of additional vertices you can choose) is 0 in this version of the problem.
4. **Solution Approach**: Since \( y = 0 \), Bessie cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles Bessie can form is limited to the number of triangles that can be formed using the \( x \) vertices she has already chosen. However, since \( x \geq 2 \), the minimum number of vertices required to form a triangle is 3. Hence, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \) if \( x \geq 3 \). If \( x = 2 \), no triangles can be formed.
5. **Implementation Check**: The given code does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Instead, it defines numerous utility functions that are not used in solving the specific problem at hand. The relevant logic should directly compute the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It lacks the necessary logic to determine the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **False**
