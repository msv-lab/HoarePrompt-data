Output State: **`ver` is the first element in `q` (after applying `popleft()`), all nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` contains the remaining elements (if any) after removing the first element.**

In this output state, the variable `ver` now holds the value of the first element that was previously in the queue `q`. The condition that all nodes reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited remains unchanged. Additionally, `q` is updated to contain the remaining elements after the first element has been removed.
