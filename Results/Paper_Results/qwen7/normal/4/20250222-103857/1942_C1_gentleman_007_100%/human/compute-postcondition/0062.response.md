Output State: **`q` now contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]`, the third element in `graph[ver]`, and `node`; `node` is the third element in `graph[ver]`; `vis[node]` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the value of `node` to the list `q`. Given the initial state, `q` already contains the original elements plus the first element in `graph[ver]` and the third element in `graph[ver]`. After appending `node`, which is the third element in `graph[ver]`, `q` will now contain these elements. The value of `node` remains the same, and `vis[node]` is set to 1.
