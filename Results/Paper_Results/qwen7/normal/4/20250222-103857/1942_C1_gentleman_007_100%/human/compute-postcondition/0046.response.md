The loop condition is based on the length of the queue `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must not be empty at the start of the next iteration. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration shows that `q` is empty, we need to adjust the state such that `q` is not empty at the start of the next iteration.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop continues as long as `len(q)` is non-zero.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is empty.
3. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `q` must contain at least one element at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `q` contains at least one element.

State: **All nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` must contain at least one element.**
