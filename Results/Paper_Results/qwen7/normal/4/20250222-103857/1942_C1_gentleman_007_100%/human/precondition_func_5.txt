n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose. It is given that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0. Additionally, the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
