Output State: All nodes that are reachable from the starting node `ver` through the graph's adjacency list `graph` will have their corresponding `vis` values set to 1, and they will all be appended to the deque `q`. The deque `q` will contain all these visited nodes, and no unvisited nodes will be present in `graph[ver]`.

This means that starting from the initial node `ver`, the loop will continue to explore all connected nodes in the graph until there are no more unvisited nodes reachable from the current node. At the end of all iterations, every node that can be reached from `ver` will have been marked as visited (`vis[node] == 1`), and these nodes will be stored in the deque `q`.
