Output State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, and `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `mx = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mx`. The values of `t`, `x`, and the list `subseq_lens` remain unchanged from their initial states.
