Output State: **`i` is 9, `x` is 12, `subseq_lens` contains the value 9.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^{(i-1)}\), which is \(2^8\) (since \(i\) is 9), from its current value. The initial value of `x` is 14, so after the operation, `x` becomes \(14 - 256 = 12\). The values of `i` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged.
