Output State: `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 16, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^i \leq x\). After executing the loop 3 times, `i` becomes 4, meaning \(2^4 = 16 \leq x\). Therefore, for the loop to execute all its iterations, `x` must be at least 16. After the loop completes, `i` will be incremented one more time to 5. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
