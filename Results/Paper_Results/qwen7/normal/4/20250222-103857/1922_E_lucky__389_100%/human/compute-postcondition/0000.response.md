Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18} (input value), and the value of `t` remains unchanged.**

In this case, the code reads an integer input for `x`, but it does not affect the value of `t`. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state, and `x` is assigned the value of the input provided.
