Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which is used to iterate over the elements of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x`**: Since `x` is being used to iterate over the elements of `a`, the initial value of `x` will be the first element of `a`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `a`**: The state of `a` must be such that the first three elements of `a` are all odd for the condition `cnt` is 1 to be true.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the first three elements of `a` are odd. If they are not, `cnt` will remain 0.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should reflect that the first three elements of `a` are odd.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first three elements must all be odd**
