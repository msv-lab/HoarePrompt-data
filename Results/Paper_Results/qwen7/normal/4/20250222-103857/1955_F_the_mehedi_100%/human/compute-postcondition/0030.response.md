Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, and the input value must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a list `a` from these integers. The variable `cnt` is not directly modified by this code but its value is updated based on the elements of `a` through a previous operation. The precondition that the input value must be greater than 0 remains valid as the new list `a` is formed based on valid inputs.
