Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, repeated for the number of times specified by the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `cnt` will hold the total count calculated by taking each element in the list `a` and performing integer division by 2, then summing these results. This process is repeated for every input provided by the user, as specified by the number of iterations determined from the input.
