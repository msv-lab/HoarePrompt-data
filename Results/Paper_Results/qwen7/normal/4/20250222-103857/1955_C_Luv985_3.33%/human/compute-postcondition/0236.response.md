Postcondition: **`T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either 3 or 4, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` from the last iteration, `l` is `r`, `r` is `n - 3` or `n - 2` depending on the initial condition, `k` is less than or equal to 0, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0 and `a[n-1]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
