Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 3`, `ans` is equal to 3, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[r]` is not zero, the program follows the else path, resulting in the specified conditions. If `a[r]` is zero, the program follows the if path, leading to a different set of conditions as described.
