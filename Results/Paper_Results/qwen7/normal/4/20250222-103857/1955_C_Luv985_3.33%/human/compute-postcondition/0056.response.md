Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `t` is `k % 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
