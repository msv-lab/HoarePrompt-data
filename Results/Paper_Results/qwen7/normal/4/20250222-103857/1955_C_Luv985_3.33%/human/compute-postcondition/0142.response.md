Output State: **`k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `l` must be less than `r`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `k` is still reduced by `mi * 2`, `l` is now one more than its original value, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are still reduced by `mi`, `mi` remains the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `ans` is still increased by 1.
