Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`**.

This means that the value of `a[l]` is decreased by the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The conditions that `k` must be greater than 0 and `l` must be less than `r` remain unchanged, and `mi` retains its definition as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
