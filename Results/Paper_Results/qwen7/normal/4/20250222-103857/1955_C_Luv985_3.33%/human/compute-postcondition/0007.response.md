Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is converted to an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The initial values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
