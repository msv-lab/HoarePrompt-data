Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer converted from the input string, `k` is a string from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. The value of `T` remains as `T - 1` from the initial state, and `k` remains unchanged as a string from the input.
