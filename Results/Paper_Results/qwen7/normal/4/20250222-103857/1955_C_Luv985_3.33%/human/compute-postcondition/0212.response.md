Postcondition: `T` is decremented by 1, `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4, `t` holds the value of `k % 2` at the last iteration, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, the list `a` is updated such that `a[0]` is 0, `mi` is now 0, `k` is decremented by either 0 or `0 * 2` (which is 0), and the final value of `a[n-1]` is 0.
