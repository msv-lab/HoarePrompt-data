Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` is converted to an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are each decreased by `mi`, `a[1]` is set to 0, and `a[n - 2]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `t` is `k % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k - 2 * mi` or `k % 2`), `a` is a list of integers where specific elements may be reduced by `mi` under certain conditions, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 with a possible increment of 1, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, and `t` is `k % 2` if the else part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 1, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is either 2 or 3, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, and `r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
