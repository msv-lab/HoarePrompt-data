Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from the strings in the original list, `l` is an integer within the range `[0, n-1]`, `r` is an integer within the range `[0, n-1]`, `ans` is `2`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is `2`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
