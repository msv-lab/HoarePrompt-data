Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\); `n` is converted to an integer; `k` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `T` remains an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` remains converted to an integer, and `k` becomes an integer after conversion.
