Postcondition: `T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is either 1 or 2 plus 1, `mi` is now `min(a[0], a[n - 1])`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is decreased by 1.
