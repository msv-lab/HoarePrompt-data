Output State: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\) inclusive.**

Explanation: The initial state is that `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive. The code `T -= 1` subtracts 1 from `T`. Since `T` was initially at least 1, after subtracting 1, `T` will now be an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\) inclusive.
