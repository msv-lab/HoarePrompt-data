Postcondition: **`T` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 1, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `mi` is now `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` remains 2. Otherwise, the condition does not change the value of `ans`, which remains 2.**
