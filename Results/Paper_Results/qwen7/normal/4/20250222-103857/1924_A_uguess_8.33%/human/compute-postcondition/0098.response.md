Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.**

Explanation: The code assigns a string to `ans` which consists of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times. The value of `ans` depends on the values of `k` and `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
