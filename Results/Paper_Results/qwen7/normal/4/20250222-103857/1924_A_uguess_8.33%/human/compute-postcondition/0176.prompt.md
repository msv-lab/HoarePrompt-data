You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to the length of the input string `s`. `t` is reduced by a total of 15 if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is reduced by 9. `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1` if `cnt` is less than `n`, and `0` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed. `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`. `tmp` holds the character 'a' if `cnt` is less than `n`, and is empty if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `ans` is constructed as follows: if `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times plus `tmp` plus 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is simply 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies inputs through global or external variables t, n, k, m, and s, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, n and k are integers between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function returns a value based on the given conditions and constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
