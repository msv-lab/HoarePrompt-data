Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ss` which iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`.
   - `n` is the input integer from the first input split.
   - `k` is the input integer from the second input split.
   - `m` is the input integer from the third input split.
   - `cnt` is 3.
   - `cur` remains unchanged.
   - `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.
   - `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, after processing one character, `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `ss` should be the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` should be the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 3, `cur` remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the next `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`**.
