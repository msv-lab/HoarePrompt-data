Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `t` must be at least 1 is still valid. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are not specified but are known to be integers entered by the user.
