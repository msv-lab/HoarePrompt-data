Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- The loop condition is `i < k`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be less than `k`.

### Loop Head
- The loop variable is `i`.

### Loop Condition
- The loop continues as long as `i < k`.

### Adjusting States
- Since the loop continues as long as `i < k`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of each iteration.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

### Example Answer
- Given that `i` must be less than `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

### Final State
- The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is incremented by 1, but the condition `i < k` still holds true.

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must still be less than `k`**
