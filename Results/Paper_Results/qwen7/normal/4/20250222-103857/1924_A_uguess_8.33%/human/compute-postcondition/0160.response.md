Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`.
   - The current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set to 1, in which case `tmp` is set to 'a' + `i`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `i < k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `length_of_s + 1`.
   - `k` remains unchanged since it is an external condition and not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `k` remains the same (greater than the length of the input string `s`).
   - The conditions on `cur` and `tmp` remain the same because they are not affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s` + 1, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`, and the current value of `cur` does not have the `i`-th bit set to 1, in which case `tmp` is set to 'a' + `i`**.
