Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the length of the input string `s` + 1.
   - `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is not set to 1, then `tmp` is 'a' + `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the length of the input string `s` + 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be the length of the input string `s` + 2.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Consider the condition involving `cur` and `tmp`**:
   - The condition `if the i-th bit of cur is not set to 1, then tmp is 'a' + i` does not change the value of `tmp` directly but rather sets a condition. This condition will be checked again in the next iteration, but since `i` is changing, the condition might or might not hold true depending on the bit values in `cur`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and keep `k` unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s` + 2, `k` must be greater than the length of the input string `s`**.
