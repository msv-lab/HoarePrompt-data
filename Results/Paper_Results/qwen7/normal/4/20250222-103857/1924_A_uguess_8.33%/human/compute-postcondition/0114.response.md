Output State: **`i` will be equal to `ord('a') + k - 1`, `k` remains the same as the initial input, `cur` is 0, `tmp` will be the character 'a' if `k` is a power of 2 and the position corresponds to that power, otherwise `tmp` will be an empty string, `ans` is equal to `ans + tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += tmp` adds the value of `tmp` to `ans`. The value of `tmp` is either 'a' (if `k` is a power of 2 and the position corresponds to that power) or an empty string (otherwise). The other variables (`i`, `cur`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
