Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0.**

The code initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
