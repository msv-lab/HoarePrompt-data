Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `cur` is 0, `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `cnt` is less than `n`**.
