Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `cur` is either \((1 << k) - 1\) or 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\), `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s`, `t` remains at least 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` retain their initial values, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s` and `i` must be less than `k`; `cur` is such that when shifted left by `i` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0; `tmp` is a character which is 'a' plus `i`. If the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` is true, then the condition holds as is. If the condition is false, the condition does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is length(s) + 1, `cur` is such that when shifted left by (length(s) + 1) bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, and `tmp` is the character corresponding to the integer `ord('a') + i`, if `cur` is not set to 0 at the i-th bit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `length(s) + 2`, `cur` is such that when shifted left by `(length(s) + 2)` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, and `tmp` is the character 'b', if the bit at position `i` of `cur` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
