Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ss` which is iterating over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`.
   - `n` is the input integer from the first input split.
   - `k` is the input integer from the second input split.
   - `m` is the input integer from the third input split.
   - `cnt` is 1.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `ss` is a character from the string `s`.
   - `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.
   - `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to 0.

3. **Understand what changes occur in the loop body**:
   - `ss` will be the next character in the string `s` for each iteration.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the value of `cur_ss`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s`.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `cnt` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the value of `cur_ss` for the current character `ss`.
   - `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.
   - `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will evaluate to 0 if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`.

Given that `ss` is a character from the string `s`, and assuming the loop body updates `cur` based on `cur_ss`, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`.
- `n` is the input integer from the first input split.
- `k` is the input integer from the second input split.
- `m` is the input integer from the third input split.
- `cnt` is 1.
- `cur` will be updated based on the value of `cur_ss` for the current character `ss`.
- `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.
- `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will evaluate to 0 if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `ss` for the next iteration, we can represent the state in a general form.

**State:**
- `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`.
- `n` is the input integer from the first input split.
- `k` is the input integer from the second input split.
- `m` is the input integer from the third input split.
- `cnt` is 1.
- `cur` will be updated based on the value of `cur_ss` for the current character `ss`.
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.
- `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.
- `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will evaluate to 0 if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 1, `cur` will be updated based on the value of `cur_ss` for the current character `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will evaluate to 0 if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`.**
