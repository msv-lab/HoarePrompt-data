Postcondition: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed; `cur` is either \((1 << k) - 1\) or 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\); `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s`; `t` remains at least 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` retain their initial values; `cnt` is less than `n`**
