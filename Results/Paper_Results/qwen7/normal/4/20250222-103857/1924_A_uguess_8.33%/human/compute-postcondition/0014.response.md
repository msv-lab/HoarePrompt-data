Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'; `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), where `k` is the value of `cur_ss`; `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
