Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the same as before, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'**.

This means that the value of `cur_ss` has been updated to the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
