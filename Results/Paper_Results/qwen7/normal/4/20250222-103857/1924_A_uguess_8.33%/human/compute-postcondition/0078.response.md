Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cur_ss` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. Here, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the character `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'. Since `cur` was initially 0, after this operation, `cur` will be `1 << cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
