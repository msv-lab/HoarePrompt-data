Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `ss` is a character from the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to `1 << cur_ss`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Given that `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` initially evaluates to 0, it means that `cur` did not previously have the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set. After executing the code, `cur` now includes this bit, making `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluate to `1 << cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
