Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All characters in the string `s` have been processed; `cur` is either \((1 << k) - 1\) or 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\); `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s`; `t` remains at least 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` retain their initial values; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains equal to the length of the original string `s`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `cur` will always be 0, `tmp` will hold the character 'a', and `ans` will contain the character 'a' added `n - cnt - 1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `t` is further decremented by 6. Otherwise, `i` becomes `ord('a') + k - 1`, `k` remains the same, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is equal to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the length of the input string `s`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `t` is either `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, and `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed. Otherwise, `i` is the length of the input string `s` + `k`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed, `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp`, and `ans` is the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times + `tmp` + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
