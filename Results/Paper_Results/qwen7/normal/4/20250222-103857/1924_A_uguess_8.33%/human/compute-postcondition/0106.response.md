Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and is now equal to `ord('a') + i`, `tmp` is a character where its ASCII value is `ord('a') + i`.**

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is assigned the value of the character whose ASCII value is `ord('a') + i`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1` and must still be less than `k`, `i` is now equal to `ord('a') + i - 1` (since `i` was incremented by 1 before the assignment). Therefore, `tmp` is a character corresponding to the ASCII value `ord('a') + i`.
