The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, indicating that `max_heap` was not empty before the current iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must still be non-empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`max_heap` must not be empty**
