Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

This means that after executing the line of code `diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, the variable `diff1` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`. All other variables remain in their original state, including `max_heap` which does not contain the item that was popped, and `item` which remains as the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed. The condition about `item[2]` being either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2` is still valid.
