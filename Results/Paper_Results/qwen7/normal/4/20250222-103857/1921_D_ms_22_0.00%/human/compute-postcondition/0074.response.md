Postcondition: `max_heap` is non-empty, `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on the condition `diff1 > diff2`. If `diff1 > diff2`, then `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2`, `tp2` is decremented by 1, and `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.
