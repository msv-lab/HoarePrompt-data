Output State: **`ans` is increased by `diff1`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]; `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been increased by `diff1`, while the other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
