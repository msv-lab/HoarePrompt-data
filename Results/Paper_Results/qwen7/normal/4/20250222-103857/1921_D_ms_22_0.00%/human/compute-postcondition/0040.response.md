Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`**.

Explanation: The `heapq.heappop` function removes and returns the smallest element from the heap. Since the initial state specifies that `max_heap` is non-empty, after executing `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)`, `item` will hold the smallest element from `max_heap`, and `max_heap` will no longer contain this element but will remain non-empty.
