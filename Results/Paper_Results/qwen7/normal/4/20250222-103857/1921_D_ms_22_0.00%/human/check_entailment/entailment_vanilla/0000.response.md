Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization:**
   - The array `b` is sorted.
   - A max heap (`max_heap`) is initialized to store tuples of the form `(-difference, value, index)`.

3. **Heap Population:**
   - For each element in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - It pushes the larger difference into the heap along with the corresponding index in `b`.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It maintains two pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to track the current positions in `b` for the smallest and largest values.
   - For each element popped from the heap, it checks if the index matches the current pointers.
   - If the index does not match, it recalculates the difference using the closest available values in `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - If the index matches, it adds the negative of the difference to the answer and updates the pointers.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Heap Initialization and Population:**
   - The logic of pushing the larger difference into the heap is correct. This ensures that we always consider the maximum possible difference for each element in `a`.

2. **Heap Processing Logic:**
   - The logic for updating the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` and recalculating the differences when necessary is sound. This ensures that we use the closest available values in `b` to maximize the difference.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the indices in the heap do not match the current pointers correctly by recalculating the differences.

4. **Overall Algorithm:**
   - The overall approach of sorting `b` and using a heap to dynamically select the best values from `b` to maximize the difference is correct.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
