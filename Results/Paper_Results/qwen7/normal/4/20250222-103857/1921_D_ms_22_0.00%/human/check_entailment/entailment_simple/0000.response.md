Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the array `b`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The array `b` is sorted, and a max heap is initialized to store tuples of differences, current value from `a`, and index from `b`.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program pushes the maximum difference between each element of `a` and the boundary elements of `b` into the heap. This ensures that we always consider the largest possible difference first.

4. **Processing the Heap**: The program processes the heap to ensure that the indices `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted correctly to cover the entire range of `b`. It correctly handles the conditions where the indices go out of bounds and adjusts the answer accordingly.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total difference `ans` after processing all elements.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program aims to maximize the total difference by considering the largest possible differences first and adjusting the indices to cover the entire range of `b`.

Correctness: **True**
