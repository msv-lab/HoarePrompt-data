Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty; `ans` is increased by the value `-item[0]`; `tp1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1. The values of `max_heap` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state, where `ans` was increased by the value `-item[0]` (with `item[0]` being the highest value item removed from `max_heap`).
