Output State: **`tp2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. Additionally, the third element of `item` (index) is not less than `tp1` and not greater than `tp2`, and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1`.**

This means that `tp2` has been decreased by 1, while the other conditions and values remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is still increased by `-item[0]`, and the properties of `max_heap`, `item`, and its components are preserved as per the initial conditions.
