The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `max_heap` is not empty. Given that the heap will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` after all iterations, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty for the loop to execute the first time.

Since the problem statement mentions that after all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will contain the specified tuples, we can infer that `max_heap` must be non-empty for the loop to proceed. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make `max_heap` non-empty because the problem guarantees that `max_heap` will contain elements after all iterations.

State: **`max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `i` is an element from the list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `diff` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `i` and either the first or the last element of the list `b`.**
