Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2 - 1`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`, and `ans` is `diff2` plus the original value of `ans`.**

In this output state, the `ans` variable has been updated by adding `diff2` to its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
