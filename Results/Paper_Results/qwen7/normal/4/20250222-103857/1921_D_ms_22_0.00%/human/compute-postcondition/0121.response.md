Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing one tuple (-diff2, i, m - 1)**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto a max heap. The heap is represented using the `heapq` module, which maintains the heap property. The values of `a`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The heap now contains one element, which is the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
