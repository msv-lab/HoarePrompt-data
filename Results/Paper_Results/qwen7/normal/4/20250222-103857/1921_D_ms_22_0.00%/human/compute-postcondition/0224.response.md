Output State: **`i` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `diff1` is `i`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the element at index `m-1` of `b`.**

This means that `i` remains the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `diff1` is still `i`, and `diff2` is calculated as the absolute difference between `i` and the element at index `m-1` of `b`.
