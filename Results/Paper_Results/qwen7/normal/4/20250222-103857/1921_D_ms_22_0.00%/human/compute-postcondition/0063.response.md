Postcondition: `max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `item[2]` is either equal to `tp1` or between `tp1` and `tp2` exclusive, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and if `item[2]` is `tp1 + 1`, then `tp2` remains unchanged; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
