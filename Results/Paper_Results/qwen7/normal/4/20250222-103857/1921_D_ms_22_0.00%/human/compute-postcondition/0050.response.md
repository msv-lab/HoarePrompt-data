Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2 - 1`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the third element of `item` is now compared to `tp2 - 1` instead of `tp2`. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are still calculated as the absolute differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`, respectively, and the condition that `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2` remains valid.
