Postcondition: `max_heap` is non-empty, `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2`), `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (if `diff1 > diff2`), `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `diff1 <= diff2`), `tp1` is incremented by 1 (if `diff1 > diff2`), and `tp2` is decreased by 1 (if `diff1 <= diff2`).
