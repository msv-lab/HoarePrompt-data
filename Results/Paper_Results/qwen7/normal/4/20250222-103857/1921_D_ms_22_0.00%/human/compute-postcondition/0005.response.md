Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the next input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
