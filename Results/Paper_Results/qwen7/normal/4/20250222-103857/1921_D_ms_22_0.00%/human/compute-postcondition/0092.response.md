Postcondition: `max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (denoted as `diff1`) is greater than the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (denoted as `diff2`), then `ans` is increased by `diff1` and `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `diff2` and `tp2` is decreased by 1.
