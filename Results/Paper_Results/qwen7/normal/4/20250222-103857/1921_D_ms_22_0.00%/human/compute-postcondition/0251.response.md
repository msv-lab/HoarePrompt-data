Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0]; `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed. The value of `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**

In this case, the value of `ans` is updated by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed and that `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive still holds true.
