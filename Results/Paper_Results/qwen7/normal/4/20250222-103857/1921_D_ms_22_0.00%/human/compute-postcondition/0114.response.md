Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the variable `i` and the first element of the list `b` and assigns it to the variable `diff1`. Since `a` is unaffected, it retains its initial state. The exact value of `diff1` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `i` and the first element of `b`, but it is expressed as the absolute difference between these two values.
