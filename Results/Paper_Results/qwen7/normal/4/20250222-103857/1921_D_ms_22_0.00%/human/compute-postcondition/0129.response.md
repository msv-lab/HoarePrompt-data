Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; `max_heap` is either a heap containing the tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, or a heap containing the tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1` is not greater than `diff2`.
