The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `max_heap`. For the loop to execute at least once, `max_heap` must not be empty.

Given the state right before the loop: `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` after all iterations, but we need to ensure that `max_heap` is non-empty for the loop to execute the first time.

Since the problem does not provide any specific information about the contents of `max_heap` before the loop, we can only ensure that `max_heap` is non-empty by adjusting its state to guarantee this condition.

State: **`max_heap` is non-empty**
