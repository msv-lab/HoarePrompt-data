Postcondition: `max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1] and `b[tp2]`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.
