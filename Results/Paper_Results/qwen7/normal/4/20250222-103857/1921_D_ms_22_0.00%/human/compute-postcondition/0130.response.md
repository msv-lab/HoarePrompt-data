Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1 > diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2`.
