Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`, `n` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code initializes `max_heap` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `max_heap` which is now an empty list.
