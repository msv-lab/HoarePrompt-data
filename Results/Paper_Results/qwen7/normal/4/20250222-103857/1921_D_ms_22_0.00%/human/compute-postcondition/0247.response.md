Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`; `ans` is `ans + diff2`.**

The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `diff2` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
