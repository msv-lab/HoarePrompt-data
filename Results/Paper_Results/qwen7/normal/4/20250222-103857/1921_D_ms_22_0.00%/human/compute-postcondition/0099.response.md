Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `ans` is updated according to the differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and either `tp1` is incremented by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
