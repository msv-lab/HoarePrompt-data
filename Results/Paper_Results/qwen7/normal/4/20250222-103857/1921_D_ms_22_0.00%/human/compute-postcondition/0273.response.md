Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by -item[0]; `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `tp2` has been decreased by 1, while the other variables retain their previous conditions. The `max_heap` still does not contain the item that was popped, `item` remains as the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed, and `ans` is still increased by `-item[0]`.
