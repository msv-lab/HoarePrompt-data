Postcondition: `ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed, the value of `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `ans` is further increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
