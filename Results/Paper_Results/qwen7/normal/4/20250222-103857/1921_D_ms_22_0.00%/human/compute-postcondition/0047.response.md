Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `tp1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff1` adds the value of `diff1` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. The third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, and `tp1` is increased by 1 after the operation.
