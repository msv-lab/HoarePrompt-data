Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` and `diff2` are recalculated as `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])` respectively. Depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, either a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` is pushed into `max_heap` or a max heap with one element `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is created.
