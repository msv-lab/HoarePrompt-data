Postcondition: **`i` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `diff1` is `i`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the element at index `m-1` of `b`; `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.**
