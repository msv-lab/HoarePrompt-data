Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
