Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property; `tp1` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tp1` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states.
