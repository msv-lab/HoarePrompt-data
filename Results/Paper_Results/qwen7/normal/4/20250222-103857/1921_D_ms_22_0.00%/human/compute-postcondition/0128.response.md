Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; `max_heap` is a heap with one element (`-diff2, i, m - 1`).**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto a max heap using `heapq.heappush`. This tuple is added to the heap, and the values of `a`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The heap now contains one element, which is the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.
