Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (denoted as `diff1`) or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (denoted as `diff2`), depending on which difference is greater. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`, `ans` is increased by `diff2`. Additionally, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
