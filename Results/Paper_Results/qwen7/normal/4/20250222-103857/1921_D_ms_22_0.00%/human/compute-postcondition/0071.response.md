Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, `tp1` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff1` adds the value of `diff1` to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
