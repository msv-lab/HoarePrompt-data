Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing one tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`).**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple into a max heap. The tuple contains `-diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`. Since `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`, no changes are made to `diff1` or `diff2`. The precondition that `a` is a list of integers and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2` remains valid. The heap operation does not affect the list `a`, so its state remains unchanged.
