Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `i` is an element from the list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `diff` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `i` and either the first or the last element of the list `b`. The heap will maintain these tuples such that the tuple with the largest negative difference (smallest positive difference) is at the top.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. If the current value of `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2`, depending on which is greater, and either `tp1` is increased by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and either `tp1` is increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, or `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was popped; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `tp1` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff1 <= diff2`); if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is further decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (denoted as `diff1`) or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (denoted as `diff2`), depending on which difference is greater. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`, `ans` is increased by `diff2`. Additionally, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
