Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements; `max_heap` contains the tuple (`-diff1`, `i`, 0), where `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple into a max heap using `heapq.heappush`. The tuple consists of `-diff1`, `i`, and `0`. Since `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, these values remain unchanged. The list `a` and the variable `diff2` retain their initial conditions.
