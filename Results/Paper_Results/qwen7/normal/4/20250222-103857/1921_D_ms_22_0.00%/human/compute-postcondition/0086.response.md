Output State: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` (which is the second element of the `item` tuple) and `b[tp2]`. The value of `diff1` remains unchanged. The `max_heap`, `item`, and `diff1` retain their previous states.
