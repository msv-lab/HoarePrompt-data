Output State: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the value of `-item[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the negation of the first element of the `item` tuple. Since `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `item[0]` is the maximum value in the heap before removal. The value of `ans` is thus increased by the negative of this maximum value. The state of `max_heap` and `item` remains as described in the initial state, but `ans` is updated accordingly.
