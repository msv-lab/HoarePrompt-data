Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the values in `b` are not sorted in a way that maximizes the differences. The sorting step is crucial because the goal is to maximize the total difference \(D\). However, the program sorts `b` but then uses a heuristic approach to pair elements from `a` and `b`, which may not always yield the maximum possible difference.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 8 2 10
```

Expected Output:
```
24
```

However, the program outputs:
```
23
```

This happens because the program pairs the smallest and largest elements from `b` with the corresponding elements from `a`, but it does not ensure that the maximum possible differences are always selected. A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated strategy to maximize the differences, such as pairing the closest available elements from `b` to `a` in a way that maximizes the sum of absolute differences.

A correct solution would involve a different approach to ensure that the maximum possible differences are always selected, possibly involving a more complex algorithm to sort and pair elements effectively.
