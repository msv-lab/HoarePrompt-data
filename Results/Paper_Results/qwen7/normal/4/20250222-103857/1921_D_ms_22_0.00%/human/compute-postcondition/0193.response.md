Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by -item[0]**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the negation of the first element of the `item` tuple, which was the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed. The state of `max_heap` and the fact that `item` is the highest value item that was popped are unchanged.
