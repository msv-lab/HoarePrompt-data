Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` from the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
   - `diff1` and `diff2` are calculated based on the current value of `i` (which is the last value processed in the previous iteration).
   - `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1 > diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is the current element being processed in the loop, it will be incremented to the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration.
   - `diff1` and `diff2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `max_heap` will be updated accordingly.

Given the above points, let's formulate the new state:

- `a` must have at least two elements because the loop continues as long as there are more elements to process.
- `i` will be the next element in the list `a` after the current one.
- `diff1` and `diff2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
- `max_heap` will be updated based on the new values of `diff1` and `diff2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the last processed element, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff1`, `i`, 0) if `diff1 > diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2`**.
