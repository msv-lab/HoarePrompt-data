Output State: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the value of `-item[0]`, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
