Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m - hmp[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only used to access the dictionary `hmp`. The precondition that `hmp` must have at least one key is still valid.
