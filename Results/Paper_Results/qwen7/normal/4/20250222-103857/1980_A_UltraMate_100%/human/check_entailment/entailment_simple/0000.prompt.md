Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

# Annotated Program:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a is a string of n characters where each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be 'A', as the loop processes each character in the order they appear in 'ABCDEFG'. The variable `ans` will be the sum of all increments made during the loop iterations. Specifically, for each character in 'ABCDEFG' that is not found in `hmp`, `ans` will be increased by `m`. If a character from 'ABCDEFG' is found in `hmp` but its frequency is less than `m`, `ans` will be increased by `m - hmp[i]`. If all characters in 'ABCDEFG' are found in `hmp` with their frequencies being greater than or equal to `m`, then `ans` will remain unchanged.
    #
    #In summary, `i` will be 'A', and `ans` will be the total adjustment made to it based on the conditions described above.
