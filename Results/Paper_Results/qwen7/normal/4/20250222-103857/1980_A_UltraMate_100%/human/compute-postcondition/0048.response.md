Output State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is undefined**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += m` attempts to increment the value of `ans` by `m`. However, `ans` is not defined in the initial state, and there is no other assignment or initialization for `ans` in the given code snippet. Therefore, `ans` remains undefined after the execution of the code. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
