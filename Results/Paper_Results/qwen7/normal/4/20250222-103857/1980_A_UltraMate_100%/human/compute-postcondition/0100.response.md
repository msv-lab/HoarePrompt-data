Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in hmp`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The postcondition given is `i` is `next_i`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[next_i])` if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. This means that inside the loop, `i` is updated to `next_i`, and `ans` is updated based on the value of `hmp[next_i]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `next_i`.
   - Since the loop iterates over `hmp`, `i` will take the next key in the dictionary `hmp` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be the next key in `hmp` in the next iteration.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the value of `hmp[next_i]` from the previous iteration, but for the next iteration, we don't know the exact value of `ans` yet because it depends on the loop body execution.

Given the information, we can conclude that the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the next key in `hmp`**
