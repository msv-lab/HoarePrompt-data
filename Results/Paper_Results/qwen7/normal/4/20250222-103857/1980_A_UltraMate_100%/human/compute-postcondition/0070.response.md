To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(ans)`

From the initial state, we know:
- `ans` is calculated as `2*m` plus the sum of increments made during iterations where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

However, since the specific values of `m`, `hmp`, and the increments are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of 2*m and the increments made during each iteration where hmp[i] is less than m)**
