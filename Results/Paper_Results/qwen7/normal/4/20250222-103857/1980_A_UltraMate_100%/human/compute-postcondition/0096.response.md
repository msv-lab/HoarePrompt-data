Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` becomes 'G'
- `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`. If `hmp[i] >= m`, `i` remains unchanged and `ans` does not change.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in hmp:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over each key in the dictionary `hmp`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 'G'.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next key in the dictionary `hmp`.

2. **Variable `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` changes based on the condition `hmp[i] < m`.
   - If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.
   - If `hmp[i] >= m`, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - Since we don't know the exact value of `hmp['G']`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans` without additional information.

### Adjusting the States:
- We need to update `i` to the next key in the dictionary `hmp`.
- We cannot determine the exact new value of `ans` without knowing the value of `hmp['G']` and `m`.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be the next key in the dictionary `hmp` after 'G'.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless we know the value of `hmp['G']` and `m`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the next key in the dictionary `hmp` after 'G', `ans` remains unchanged**.

To be more specific, if we denote the next key in `hmp` after 'G' as `next_i`, the state would be:

State: **`i` is `next_i`, `ans` remains unchanged**.
