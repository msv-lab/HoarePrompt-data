Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the keys of `hmp`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: The postcondition of the loop specifies that if `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hmp` must have at least one key.
   - If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, then `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.
   - If `hmp[i]` is not less than `m`, no change is made to `ans`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the keys of `hmp`, the key `i` will change to the next key in `hmp`.
   - The value of `hmp` itself does not change; it still must have at least one key.
   - The value of `ans` could either remain the same or increase by `m - hmp[i]` depending on the condition.

Given that the loop is about to execute again, the key `i` will change to the next key in `hmp`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `hmp` must still have at least one key.
   - `i` will be the next key in `hmp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`hmp` must have at least one key, `i` is the next key in `hmp`**.
