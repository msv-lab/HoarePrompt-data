Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is equal to the original value of `k` (which is greater than 1), `removed_count` remains unchanged, and `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, `removed_count` remains 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. If `removed_count` does not equal `favorite_count`, `removed_count` remains unchanged.
