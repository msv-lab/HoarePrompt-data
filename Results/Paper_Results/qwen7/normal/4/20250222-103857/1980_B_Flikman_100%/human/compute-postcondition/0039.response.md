Output State: **`a` is a list containing three integers where the first integer is `n`, the second integer is `f`, and the third integer is `k`; `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is a list of the integers in `a` sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `a` in descending order and assigns the result to `sorted_a`. The original values of `a`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `favorite_value` remain unchanged. After sorting, `sorted_a` contains the elements of `a` from highest to lowest.
