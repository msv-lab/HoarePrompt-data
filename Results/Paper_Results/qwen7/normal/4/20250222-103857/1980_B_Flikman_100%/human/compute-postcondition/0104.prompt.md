Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    favorite_value = a[f - 1]
    sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    removed_count = 0
    for i in range(k):
        if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:
            removed_count += 1
    favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)
    if removed_count == favorite_count:
        print('YES')
    elif removed_count == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('MAYBE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `removed_count` is either `0` or `k`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`, and `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count` if the else part is executed, while `removed_count` equals `favorite_count` if the if part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is equal to the original value of `k` (which is greater than 1), `removed_count` is 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value` otherwise `removed_count` remains unchanged, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, then `removed_count` is set to 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value`; otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged. If `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`, then `removed_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `favorite_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`, `removed_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`. In both cases, these counts retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations. If `removed_count` equals `favorite_count`, the function continues with these counts unchanged. If `removed_count` does not equal `favorite_count`, the function also continues with these counts unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
