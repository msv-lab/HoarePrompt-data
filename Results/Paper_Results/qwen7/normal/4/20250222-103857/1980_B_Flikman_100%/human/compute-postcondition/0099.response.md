Postcondition: `favorite_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`, `removed_count` is either 0 or equal to the number of times `sorted_a[i]` equals `favorite_value` for `i` in the range of `k`, and `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. `removed_count` is greater than 0, and all other variables (`k`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `t`) retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations.
