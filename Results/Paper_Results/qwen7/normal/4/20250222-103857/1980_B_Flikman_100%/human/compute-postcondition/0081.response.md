Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2, and if `sorted_a[2]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then the postcondition remains as `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2. If `sorted_a[2]` is not equal to `favorite_value`, the postcondition still holds with `i` being 2 and `k` being greater than 2.
