Output State: `removed_count` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 1, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a` in descending order, and `i` is incremented by 2 such that the element at index `i + 1` in `sorted_a` is no longer equal to `favorite_value`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `removed_count` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration until `i` reaches a point where the condition `sorted_a[i] == favorite_value` is no longer true. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `removed_count` will be 3. The value of `i` will be incremented by 3 (since it increments by 1 in each iteration), so `i + 1` will be the index just beyond the last occurrence of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.
