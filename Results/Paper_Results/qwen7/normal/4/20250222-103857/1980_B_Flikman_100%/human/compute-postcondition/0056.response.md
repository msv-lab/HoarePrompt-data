Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is equal to the original value of `k` (which is greater than 1), and `removed_count` is 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be 2 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k`, and it increments `i` each time through the loop.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged and is greater than 1.
- The variable `removed_count` is incremented by 1 during each iteration only if the element at index `i` in `sorted_a` equals `favorite_value`. After 3 iterations, `removed_count` will be 1 if `sorted_a[2]` equals `favorite_value`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
