Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the possibility that the favorite cube might be among the last `k` cubes after sorting but before removal. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate this issue:

Consider the following input:
```
5 2 3
4 3 3 2 3
```
- The favorite cube is the second one with value 3.
- After sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The first three cubes are removed, which are `[4, 3, 3]`.

In this case, the favorite cube is still present in the remaining array and would not be removed. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" because it checks if the number of times the favorite value appears in the first `k` elements is equal to the total number of times it appears in the sorted array, which is not the correct logic.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the favorite cube is within the first `k` positions after sorting, rather than just checking the count of occurrences.
