The function accepts a list of integers `array` (representing a permutation of length `n`) and an integer `find` (such that 1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). It performs a binary search to find the position of `find` in `array`. If `find` is present in `array`, it returns a list containing the 1-based indices of `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1` as strings. If `find` is not present, it prints `1` and returns the same list of indices.
