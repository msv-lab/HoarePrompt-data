Output State: **`mid` is equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2; `r` is equal to `mid`**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The calculation for `mid` remains unchanged from the initial state, which is (`l` + `r`) // 2. Therefore, `mid` is still equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2, and `r` is now equal to the previous value of `mid`.
