Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `x`.
   - It then reads the permutation `array` and calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the permutation `array` and the target value `find` as inputs.
   - It initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`.
   - It performs a binary search to find the index where `find` should be placed.
   - After the binary search loop, it checks if the target value `find` is already at the correct position (`array.index(find)`).
   - If `find` is not at the correct position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.
   - If `find` is already at the correct position, it prints `0`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop condition `while r - l > 1:` is correct.
   - The calculation of `mid` using `(l + r) // 2` is also correct.
   - The logic inside the loop to update `l` and `r` based on whether `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find` is correct.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The logic to check if `find` is already at the correct position is correct.
   - However, the function only handles the case where `find` is not at the correct position by performing one swap.
   - The problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient, but the current implementation only performs one swap.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function should print `1` and return the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.
   - If no swaps are needed, it should print `0`.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        # Find the index of the element that needs to be swapped
        idx_to_swap = array.index(find)
        # Perform the first swap
        array[l], array[idx_to_swap] = array[idx_to_swap], array[l]
        # Now perform the second swap to place the element in the correct position
        array[l], array[r-1] = array[r-1], array[l]
        return [str(l + 1), str(idx_to_swap + 1)]
    else:
        return [str(0)]
```

### Conclusion

The original program only performs one swap when necessary, but the problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient. Therefore, the program needs to be modified to ensure it performs the required two swaps.

Correctness: **False**
