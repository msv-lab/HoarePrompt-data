To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given postcondition.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while r - l > 1:
```

This means the loop continues as long as the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than 1.

### Postcondition from the Previous Iteration
From the postcondition:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is equal to `mid`.
- Otherwise, `r` is equal to `mid`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `r - l > 1`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `array` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
   - `l` (current value)
   - `r` (current value)

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `r - l > 1` must still hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `r - l > 1` remains true after the adjustments.

### Adjusting the States
- **`l` and `r`**: These are the only variables involved in the loop condition `r - l > 1`. We need to ensure that the difference between `r` and `l` is still greater than 1.

Given that `r - l > 1` must remain true, we can conclude that both `l` and `r` should not be adjusted in such a way that their difference becomes 1 or less.

### Final State
Since the loop condition depends on `r - l > 1`, and no other variables are involved in this condition, we do not need to make any specific adjustments to `l` or `r` beyond ensuring they maintain the relationship `r - l > 1`.

Therefore, the state after the previous iteration remains unchanged for the purpose of the loop condition.

**State:**
**`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is its current value, `r` is its current value, and `r - l > 1` must hold true.**
