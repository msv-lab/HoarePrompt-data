Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n and n must be greater than 1; `mid` is (l + r) // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` using the formula `(l + r) // 2`. However, the values of `l` and `r` are not provided in the initial state, so `mid` is expressed in terms of `l` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
