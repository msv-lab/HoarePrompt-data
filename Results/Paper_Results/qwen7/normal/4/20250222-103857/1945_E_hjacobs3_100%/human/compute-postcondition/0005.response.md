Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n and n must be greater than 1; `mid` is (l + r) // 2; `l` is equal to `mid` and `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.**

The code assigns the value of `mid` to `l`, so `l` now holds the same value as `mid`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
