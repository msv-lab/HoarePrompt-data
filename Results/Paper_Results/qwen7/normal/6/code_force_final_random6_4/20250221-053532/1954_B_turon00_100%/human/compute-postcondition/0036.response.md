`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state is that `i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` remains the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution. Additionally, whether `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the final values of `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` will satisfy these conditions.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `cnt` remains the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution. Additionally, whether `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, the final values of `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` will satisfy these conditions.**
