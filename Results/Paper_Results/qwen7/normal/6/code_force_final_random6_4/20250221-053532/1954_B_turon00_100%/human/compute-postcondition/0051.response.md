Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is either `n` or `2`, `cnt` is 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially set to 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, after executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` will be 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, or 1 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
