Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, the value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an initial value that must be at least 1. Since it was initially at least 1, after adding 1, `cnt` becomes 1. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the value of `a[i]` remains equal to `tmp`.
