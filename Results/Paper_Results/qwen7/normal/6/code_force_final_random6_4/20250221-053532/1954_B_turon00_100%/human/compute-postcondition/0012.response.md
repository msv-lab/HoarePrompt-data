Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the value of `ans`, which remains updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. The value of `i` stays 0, and the condition about the element at index `i` in list `a` not being equal to `tmp` remains unchanged.
