Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in `a`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
