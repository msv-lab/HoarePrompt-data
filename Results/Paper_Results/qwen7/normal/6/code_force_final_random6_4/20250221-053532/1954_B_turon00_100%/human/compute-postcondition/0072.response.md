Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `a`. The other variables (`i`, `tmp`, `ans`, `cnt`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
