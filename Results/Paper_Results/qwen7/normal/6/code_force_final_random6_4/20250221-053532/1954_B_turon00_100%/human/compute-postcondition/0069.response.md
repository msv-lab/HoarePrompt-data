Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, and `cnt` is 0. If either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no change occurs. Otherwise, the condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` holds true.**
