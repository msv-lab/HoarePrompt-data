Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution.
- `cnt` is 0.
- The condition either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` holds true.

The `print(-1)` statement is executed directly without any further operations or conditions that would change the value being printed.

Output: **-1**
