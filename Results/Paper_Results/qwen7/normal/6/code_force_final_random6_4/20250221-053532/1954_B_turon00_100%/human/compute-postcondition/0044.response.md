Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is less than `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is `n`, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 0, after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
