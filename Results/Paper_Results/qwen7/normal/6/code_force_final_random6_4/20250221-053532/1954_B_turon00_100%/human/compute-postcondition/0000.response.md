Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer**.

This means that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the range of 1 to 10^4. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged, specifically, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
