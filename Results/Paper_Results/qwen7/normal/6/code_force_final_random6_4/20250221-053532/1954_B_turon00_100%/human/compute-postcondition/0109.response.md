Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `i` will be `3 * n`, `tmp` will be equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution across all inputs, `n` will remain unchanged for each individual input but will be processed sequentially, and either `n == 1 or ans == n` is satisfied for each input, or `i` will be greater than or equal to the length of the list `a` for each input.

This means that after processing all `t` inputs, the counter `t` will have been decremented to 0, and for each input, the loop will have fully processed the list `a` up to `3 * n` (considering the summation effect of incrementing `i` by `n` for each input), with `tmp` holding the first element of the list for the current input, `ans` containing the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` for that input, and the conditions for printing `-1` or the result will have been evaluated and printed as necessary.
