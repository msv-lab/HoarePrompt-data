Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning all lines of input have been processed except for those that do not fit the pattern (i.e., every second line starting from the third line). The variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` remains a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`. The variable `line` contains the last line of input that fits the pattern (every second line starting from the third line).

In simpler terms, the loop has processed all valid input lines, and now `line` holds the last valid input line, while `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their original constraints and values.
