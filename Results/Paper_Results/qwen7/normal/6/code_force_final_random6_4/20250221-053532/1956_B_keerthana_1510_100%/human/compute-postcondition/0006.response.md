Let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.
   - `line` is the next line of input, but its content is not specified in the initial state.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `tokens := line.split()`: This splits the `line` into a list of tokens (words or strings) and assigns it to `tokens`.
   - `len(tokens)`: This calculates the number of tokens in the `tokens` list.
   - `{*tokens}`: This creates a set from the `tokens` list, which removes any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})`: This calculates the number of unique tokens in the `tokens` list.
   - `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`: This computes the difference between the total number of tokens and the number of unique tokens, which gives the count of duplicate tokens.

3. **Output**:
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` will give the number of duplicate tokens in the `tokens` list.

Given the initial state, the exact value of `line` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact number of duplicates without knowing the specific content of `line`. However, we can describe the output in general terms.

Output: **the number of duplicate tokens in the `line` split into tokens**
