Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is flawed and does not follow the rules of the game as described. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens in each line, which is not relevant to the game's scoring mechanism.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how the solution should work:

1. Parse the input to get the value of \( n \) and the cards in your hand.
2. Simulate the game, considering that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
3. Determine the maximum number of points you can get under these conditions.

A correct implementation would involve simulating the game and accounting for the optimal strategy of both players. The provided code does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
