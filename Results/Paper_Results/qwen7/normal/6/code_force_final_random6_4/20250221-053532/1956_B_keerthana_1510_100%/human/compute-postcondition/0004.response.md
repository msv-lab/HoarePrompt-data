Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.
   - `line` is the next line of input.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `line.split()` splits the string `line` into a list of tokens (words or substrings).
   - The expression `tokens := line.split()` assigns the result of `line.split()` to the variable `tokens` and evaluates to `tokens`.
   - `len(tokens)` gives the number of tokens in the list.
   - `{*tokens}` creates a set from the list `tokens`, removing any duplicate tokens.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique tokens in the list.
   - The expression `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` calculates the number of duplicate tokens in the list.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `line` is the next line of input, it could be any string, but the important part is how many duplicates there are in the split tokens.
   - The difference between the number of tokens and the number of unique tokens will give us the count of duplicate tokens.

Therefore, the output will be the number of duplicate tokens in the input line.

Output: **number of duplicate tokens in the input line**
