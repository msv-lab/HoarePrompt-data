Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value plus the health of the next monster plus `health`, `monsters` is a list of tuples with one less element, `distance` is the absolute value of the `pos` from the next tuple, `total_bullets_needed` is twice the new `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` remains unchanged; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_bullets_needed` to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
