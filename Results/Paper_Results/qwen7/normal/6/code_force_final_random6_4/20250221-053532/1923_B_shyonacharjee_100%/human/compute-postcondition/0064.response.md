Output State: **`can_survive` remains False, `monsters` is a non-empty list without the first two tuples, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster minus `bullets_used`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the next monster.**

Explanation: The code `bullets_used += health` increments the value of `bullets_used` by the health of the next monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The `can_survive` variable remains `False`, the `monsters` list is still a non-empty list without its first two tuples, `pos` and `health` retain their respective values, and `distance` remains the absolute value of the position of the next monster.
