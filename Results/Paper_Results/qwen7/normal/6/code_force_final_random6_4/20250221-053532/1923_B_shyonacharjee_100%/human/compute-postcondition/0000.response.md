Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4; the value of t is now an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but its specific value is now determined by the user's input. All other conditions and constraints on `t` remain unchanged.
