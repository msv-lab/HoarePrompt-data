Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `can_survive` is True, `bullets_used` is 0, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `pos` is undefined, `health` is undefined, `distance` is undefined, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is `health`, `monsters` remains a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `pos` is the position of the first monster, `health` is the health of the first monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and either `total_bullets_needed` is `health` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out, or `total_bullets_needed` does not exceed `distance * k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is health + health, `monsters` remains a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`, otherwise the program continues executing without any changes to these variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is `health + health + health`, `monsters` remains a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `health` is the health of the next monster, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
