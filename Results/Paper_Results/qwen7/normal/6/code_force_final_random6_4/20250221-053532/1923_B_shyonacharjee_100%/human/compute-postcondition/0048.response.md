Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` of the first monster, `can_survive` is False, `monsters` is a non-empty list, `pos` is the position of the first monster in the list, `health` is the health of the first monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the first monster in the list, and `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`.**

Explanation: The code `bullets_used += health` increments the value of `bullets_used` by the `health` of the first monster in the list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
