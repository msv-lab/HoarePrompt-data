Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute value of `pos` to the variable `distance`. Since the initial value of `pos` is not specified, `distance` will be the absolute value of whatever `pos` holds. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
