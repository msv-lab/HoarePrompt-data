t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The third line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
