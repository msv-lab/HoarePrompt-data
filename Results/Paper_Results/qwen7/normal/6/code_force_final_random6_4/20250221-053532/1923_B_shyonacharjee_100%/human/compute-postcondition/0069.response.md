Output State: **`can_survive` is False, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all the monsters, `monsters` is an empty list, `pos` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
