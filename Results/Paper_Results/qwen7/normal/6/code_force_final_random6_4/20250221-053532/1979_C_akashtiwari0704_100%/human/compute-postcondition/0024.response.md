Output State: **`a[i]' is updated to `prod // a[i]', sumo is increased by int(a[i])**, and all other variables retain their original values.

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by converting `a[i]` to an integer. The value of `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` from the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
