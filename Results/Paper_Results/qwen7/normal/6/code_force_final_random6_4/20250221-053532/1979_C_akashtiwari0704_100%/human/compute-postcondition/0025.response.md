Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `bets - 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
   - `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.
   - `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is about to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `prod` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified within the loop.
   - `sumo` remains unchanged because it is not directly modified outside the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`, which will be incremented by 1.
   - `prod` and `sumo` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a[i+1]' is updated to `prod // a[i+1]', sumo is increased by int(a[i+1])**
