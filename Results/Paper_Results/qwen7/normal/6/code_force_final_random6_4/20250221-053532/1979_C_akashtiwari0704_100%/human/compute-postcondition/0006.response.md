Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(l))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `g` is `l[0]`
   - `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 1) must still be less than `len(l)`.
   - `l` must still have at least 1 element, but since `i` is now 1, `l` must have at least 2 elements to ensure the loop continues.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `g` remains `l[0]`.
   - `l` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
