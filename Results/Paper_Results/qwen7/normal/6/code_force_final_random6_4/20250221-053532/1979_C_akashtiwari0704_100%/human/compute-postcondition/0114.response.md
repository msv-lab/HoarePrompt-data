Output State: **`ans` is an empty string, `sumo` will be the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, the value of `i` will be `len(a) + 3*bets - 3`, `bets` will be less than `len(a) + 2*bets - 3`, `a` will consist of the updated values, and `prod` will remain the LCM of the elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty string. No changes are made to the values of `sumo`, `i`, `bets`, `a`, or `prod`. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state, with `ans` being explicitly stated as an empty string.
