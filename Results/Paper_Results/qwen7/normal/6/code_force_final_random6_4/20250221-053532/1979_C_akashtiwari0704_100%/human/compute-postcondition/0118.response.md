Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space, `bets` is a non-negative integer that satisfies `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends `str(a[i])` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 2, so `str(a[i])` becomes `str(a[2])`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `ans` now includes `str(a[0])` followed by `str(a[1])` and a space. The condition for `bets` remains unchanged.
