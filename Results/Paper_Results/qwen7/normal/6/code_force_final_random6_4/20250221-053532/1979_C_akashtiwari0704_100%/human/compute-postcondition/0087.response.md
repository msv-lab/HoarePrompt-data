Output State: **`g` is `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `l[i]` refers to the first element of the list `l`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The length of the list `l` is not affected by this operation.
