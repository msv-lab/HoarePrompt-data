Postcondition: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `bets` is the initial value it was set to, `i` is `bets`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces, and `T` is `T + len(l) - 1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`**
