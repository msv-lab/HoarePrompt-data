Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `g` is `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`
   - `i` is 0

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop will increment `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `g` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `g` within the loop.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `g` remains `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`
   - `i` becomes 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`g` is `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `i` is 1**
