Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < bets`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by a space.
   - `bets` is a non-negative integer that satisfies `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`.

4. **Calculate the Value of `bets`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `1 < bets` must hold true.
   - Therefore, `bets` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `bets` must remain the same value it had at the end of the previous iteration but must still satisfy the condition `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is a string containing `str(a[0])` followed by a space, `bets` is a non-negative integer that satisfies `bets < len(a) + 2*bets - 3`**
