Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop variable is `T`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is equal to `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `T < t`.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `T` and it needs to increment until `T` reaches `t`, at the start of the next iteration, `T` should be incremented by 1.

4. **List the states that need to be adjusted:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we need to adjust `T` to be `T + 1`.

5. **State the new state:**
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `T` is now `T + 1`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is the length of `a`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces, and `T` is `T + 1`**.
