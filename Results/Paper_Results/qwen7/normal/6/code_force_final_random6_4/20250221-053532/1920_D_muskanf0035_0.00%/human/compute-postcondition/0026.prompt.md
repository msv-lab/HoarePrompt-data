Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is an empty list, and `operations` is an empty list or contains tuples that have been fully processed.

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `array` will contain all the values that were appended based on the operations provided, with each value being appended multiple times depending on the operation type (1 appends once, not 1 appends thrice). `result` remains an empty list as no operations modify it within the given loop. The `operations` list will be empty since all its tuples have been processed.
Code of the loop:
for k in queries:
    result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `operations` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `k` is the first element of `queries`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `operations` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `k` is the second element of `queries`, and `result` has an additional element appended which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `operations` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `k` is the third element of `queries`, and `result` now has two additional elements appended which are `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
