Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of positive integers representing the queries. op_type is either 1 or 2, where 1 indicates appending an integer to the end of the array, and 2 indicates appending x copies of the current array to the end. value is the integer to append when op_type is 1, and the number of copies to append when op_type is 2. The length of operations is equal to n, and the length of queries is equal to q.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is an empty list, and `operations` is an empty list or contains tuples that have been fully processed.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `array` will contain all the values that were appended based on the operations provided, with each value being appended multiple times depending on the operation type (1 appends once, not 1 appends thrice). `result` remains an empty list as no operations modify it within the given loop. The `operations` list will be empty since all its tuples have been processed.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: `array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with `len(queries)` additional elements, each being `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` where `k` is each element of `queries` in order, and `operations` is an empty list since all its tuples have been processed.
    return result
    #The program returns a list 'result' where each element is calculated as array[(k - 1) % len(array)], with 'k' being each element from the queries list in order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of operations), `operations` (a list of tuples specifying the type of operation and the value to operate with), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the queries). It performs the specified operations on an initially empty array and then calculates the result for each query based on the final state of the array. The result is a list containing the queried values, where each value is determined by the formula `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, with `k` being each element from the `queries` list in order.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of operations, q is an integer representing the number of queries, operations is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x indicating the type of operation (1 or 2) and the value x, and queries is a list of integers k_i representing the positions of the elements Jayden wants to know.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer representing the number of operations for the last iteration, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries for the last iteration, `queries` is a list of integers representing the positions of the elements Jayden wants to know for the last iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` will still be greater than 0 (since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0), `n` and `q` will be the values corresponding to the last iteration of the loop, `queries` will be the list of integers representing the positions of the elements for the last query, and `result` will be the outcome of the `func_1` function applied to the parameters of the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of operations and queries. For each iteration, it reads the number of operations (`n`), the number of queries (`q`), a list of operations, and a list of query positions. It then calls `func_1` to process these inputs and returns the results of the queries. The function outputs the results for each set of operations and queries.
