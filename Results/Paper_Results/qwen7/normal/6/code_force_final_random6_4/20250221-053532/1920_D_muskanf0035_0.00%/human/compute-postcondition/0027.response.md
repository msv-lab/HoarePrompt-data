Output State: **The program returns a list 'result' where each element is calculated as array[(k - 1) % len(array)], with 'k' being each element from the queries list in order.**

This means that for each `k` in `queries`, the corresponding element in `result` is determined by taking `k-1` modulo the length of `array` and then accessing the element at that index in `array`.
