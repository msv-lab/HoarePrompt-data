Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `operations` is a list of n sublists, each containing two integers (each integer is an input)**

Explanation: The code creates a list named `operations` which contains `n` sublists. Each sublist is created by taking input from the user and splitting it into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the number of sublists and their contents depend on user input, the exact values cannot be determined without additional input. However, we know that `n` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `t` must still be greater than 0.
