Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of input integers formed by splitting the input string and converting it to integers.**

Explanation: The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `queries`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
