You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

The `operations` list will be empty since all its tuples have been processed.

    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` will still be greater than 0 (since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0), `n` and `q` will be the values corresponding to the last iteration of the loop, `queries` will be the list of integers representing the positions of the elements for the last query, and `result` will be the outcome of the `func_1` function applied to the parameters of the last iteration.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly simulate the appending of `x` copies of the array when `b=2`. Instead, it only extends the array with a repeated pattern of its current elements, rather than appending `x` copies of the entire current array.

For example, consider the following sequence of operations:
- Append 1 (Operation 1)
- Append 2 (Operation 1)
- Append 3 (Operation 1)
- Append 3 copies of the current array (Operation 2)

The correct resulting array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, but the program incorrectly handles this operation, leading to an incorrect array structure. This discrepancy can be observed in the test cases where the array size and content do not match the expected behavior.
