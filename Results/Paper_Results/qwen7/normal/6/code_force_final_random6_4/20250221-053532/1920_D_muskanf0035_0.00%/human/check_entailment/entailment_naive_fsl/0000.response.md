Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly simulate the appending of `x` copies of the array when `b=2`. Instead, it only extends the array with a repeated pattern of its current elements, rather than appending `x` copies of the entire current array.

For example, consider the following sequence of operations:
- Append 1 (Operation 1)
- Append 2 (Operation 1)
- Append 3 (Operation 1)
- Append 3 copies of the current array (Operation 2)

The correct resulting array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, but the program incorrectly handles this operation, leading to an incorrect array structure. This discrepancy can be observed in the test cases where the array size and content do not match the expected behavior.
