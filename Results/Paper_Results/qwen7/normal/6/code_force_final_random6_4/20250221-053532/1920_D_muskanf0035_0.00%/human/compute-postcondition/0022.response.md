Functionality: **The function processes a series of operations and queries. For each iteration, it reads the number of operations (`n`), the number of queries (`q`), a list of operations, and a list of query positions. It then calls `func_1` to process these inputs and returns the results of the queries. The function outputs the results for each set of operations and queries.**
