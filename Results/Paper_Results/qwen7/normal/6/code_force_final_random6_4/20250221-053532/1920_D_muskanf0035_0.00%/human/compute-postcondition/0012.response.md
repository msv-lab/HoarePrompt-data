Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `queries` is a list of integers formed by the split and mapped input string.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, which is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `result`. However, we know that `result` is a list of values returned by `func_1`.

Output: **result (where result is the list returned by func_1(n, operations, queries))**
