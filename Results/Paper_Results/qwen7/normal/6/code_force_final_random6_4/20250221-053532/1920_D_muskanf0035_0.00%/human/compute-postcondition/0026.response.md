Output State: **`array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with `len(queries)` additional elements, each being `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` where `k` is each element of `queries` in order, and `operations` is an empty list since all its tuples have been processed.**

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `array` will contain all the values that were appended based on the operations provided, with each value being appended multiple times depending on the operation type (1 appends once, not 1 appends thrice). `result` will contain `len(queries)` elements, each being `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` where `k` is each element of `queries` in the order they appeared. The `operations` list will be empty since all its tuples have been processed.
