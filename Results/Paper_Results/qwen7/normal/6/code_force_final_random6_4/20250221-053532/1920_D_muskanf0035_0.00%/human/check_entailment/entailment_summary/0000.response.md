### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to simulate the operations on an initially empty array `a`.
   - Operations can be of two types:
     - Append an integer `x` to the end of the array.
     - Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer `q` queries asking for the `k-th` element of the final array.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of tuples specifying the operation type and value), and `queries` (list of query positions).
   - It iterates through the operations and builds the array according to the given rules.
   - For each query, it computes the position using `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle the circular nature of the array due to repeated appending.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of operations `n` and queries `q` for each test case.
   - It reads the operations and queries for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the results and prints them.

4. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the operations and handles the circular nature of the array.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and calls `func_1` appropriately.
   - Given the constraints and the problem description, the provided functions should work correctly for the given input format.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
