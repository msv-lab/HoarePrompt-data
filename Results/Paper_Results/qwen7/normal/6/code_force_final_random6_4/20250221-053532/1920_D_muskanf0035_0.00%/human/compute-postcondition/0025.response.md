Output State: **`array` is a list containing the values appended according to the operations, `result` is a list with one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `operations` is a list containing at least one tuple, and `k` is the third element of `queries`, and `result` now has two additional elements appended which are `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` to the `result` list. This means that the `result` list now has one more element added to it, which is the value of `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
