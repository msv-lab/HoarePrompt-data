Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function prints a query `? d` and reads the response from the input.
   - It returns a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` and `u` is the vertex that is not connected to `v`.
   - If no such vertex `v` is found, it returns `(0, 0)`.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the original graph using at most `n` queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.
   - It iteratively removes vertices from `remaining_vertices` until it is empty.
     - For each iteration, it tries to find a suitable vertex `v` with the maximum degree `d` starting from `n-1` down to `0`.
     - If a suitable vertex `v` is found (i.e., `v` is not `0`), it adds `v` to the `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path and flushes the output buffer.

### Verification

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1(d)` correctly handles the query and returns the expected values.
   - The function `func_2(n)` correctly uses the results from `func_1(d)` to build the Hamiltonian path.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The function `func_2(n)` iterates over degrees from `n-1` to `0` to find the next vertex in the path.
   - It ensures that the selected vertex `v` is in `remaining_vertices` before adding it to the path.
   - It correctly removes the selected vertex from `remaining_vertices` after adding it to the path.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty, ensuring that all vertices are included in the path.
   - The path construction logic ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, forming a Hamiltonian path.

4. **Output**:
   - The Hamiltonian path is printed in the correct format, and the output buffer is flushed to ensure immediate interaction with the judge.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most `n` queries as specified in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
