Output State: **`d` is `n - 2`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, and `path` either includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence or remains unchanged, and we either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the return values of the function `func_1(d)` to the variables `v` and `u`. Since `d` is `n - 2`, the function `func_1(n - 2)` is called, and its two return values are assigned to `v` and `u`. The other variables (`remaining_vertices`, `path`) are not affected by this operation. The condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains unchanged.
