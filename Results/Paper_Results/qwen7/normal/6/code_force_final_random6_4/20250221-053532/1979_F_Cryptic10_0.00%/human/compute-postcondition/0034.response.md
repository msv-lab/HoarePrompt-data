Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding all vertices that were added to `path`. `d` is -1. `u` is equal to `func_1(-1)`, which is undefined since the loop condition `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` ensures `d` will never reach -1 within the loop. `v` is the last vertex added to `path` before breaking out of the loop, and `path` contains all vertices added during the loop iterations.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `d` has gone through all values from `n-1` down to 0. The `remaining_vertices` set will contain all vertices that were not added to `path`. Since the loop breaks on each iteration when a vertex is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`, `path` will contain all vertices that were successfully added to it. The variable `u` will be the result of the last call to `func_1(d)` with `d` being -1, but since the loop condition does not allow `d` to reach -1, `u` will be undefined in practical terms.
