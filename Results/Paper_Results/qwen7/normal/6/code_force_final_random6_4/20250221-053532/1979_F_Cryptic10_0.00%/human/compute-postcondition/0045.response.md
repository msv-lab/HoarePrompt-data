Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` now includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the code was originally placed. The values of the variables `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
