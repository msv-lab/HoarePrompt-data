Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `d`. The loop iterates over the range from `n-1` to `-1` in reverse order.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `d` is within the specified range. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `d` is `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `d`**: Since the loop is iterating in reverse order, the next value of `d` would be `d - 1`. Given that `d` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `d` will be `n-2`.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables mentioned in the postcondition (`v`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`, `func_1`, `path`) are not part of the loop head. Therefore, their values remain unchanged for the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `d` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `d` is `n-2`, `v` is either removed from `remaining_vertices` or remains unchanged, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` either includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence or remains unchanged.**
