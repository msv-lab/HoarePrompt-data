Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding `v`, `d` is n-2, `u` is assigned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional that was being executed. The values of `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
