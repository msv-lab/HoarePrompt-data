Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `remaining_vertices` is a non-empty set containing integers from 1 to n excluding all vertices that were added to `path`
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is `n-1`, `v` is either removed from `remaining_vertices` or remains unchanged, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` either includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence or remains unchanged, and we either break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is `n - 2`, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the return values of `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` includes `v` appended, and if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is removed from `path` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
