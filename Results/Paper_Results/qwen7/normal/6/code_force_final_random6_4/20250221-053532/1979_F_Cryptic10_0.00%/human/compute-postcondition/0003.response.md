Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `d`, which is initialized using the expression `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `d` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `d`**: Since the loop starts with `d` being `n-1`, the initial value of `d` should be `n-1`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `d` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `d` must be initialized to a value that is within the range specified by the `range` function.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `d` and `n`. The state of `remaining_vertices` and `path` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `d` and `n`. Specifically, `d` should be `n-1` and `n` must be an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `d` is n-1**
