The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the provided code snippet, the variables themselves are not directly affected by this statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding v, `d` is n-3, `u` is equal to `func_1(n-3)`, `v` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains v and u.**
