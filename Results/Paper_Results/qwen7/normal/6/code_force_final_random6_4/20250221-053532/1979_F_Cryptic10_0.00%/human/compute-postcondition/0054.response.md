Output State: **`d` is `n - 2`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and we continue the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `path` now includes this value. The other variables (`d`, `u`) remain unchanged, and the condition to continue the most internal loop or if statement is met regardless of whether `v` is 0 or not.
