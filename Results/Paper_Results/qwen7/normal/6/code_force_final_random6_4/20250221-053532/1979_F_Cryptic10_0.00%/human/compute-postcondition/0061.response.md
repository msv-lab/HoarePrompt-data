Output State: **`d` is `n - 3`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged from their initial states.
