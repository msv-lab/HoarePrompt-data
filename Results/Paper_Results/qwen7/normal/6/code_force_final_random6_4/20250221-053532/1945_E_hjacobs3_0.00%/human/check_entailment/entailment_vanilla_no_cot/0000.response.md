Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue lies in how the binary search is being used and the logic for determining the swaps. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is implemented incorrectly. The `l` and `r` variables should start from 1 and `n`, respectively, as per the problem statement. Also, the condition `array[mid] >= find` should be adjusted to match the problem's requirement where we want to find the position of `x`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_1` only returns a swap if the element at the middle index (`mid`) is not equal to `x`. This is insufficient because it doesn't account for the possibility that the element at the middle index might be less than `x` but still needs to be swapped to the correct position.

3. **Multiple Swaps**: The problem states that two operations are always sufficient, but the current implementation might not always find the correct positions with just one swap.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Find the index of x in the array
    index_x = array.index(x)
    
    # Perform binary search to find the correct position for x
    l, r = 1, n + 1
    while l < r - 1:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if array[m - 1] <= x:
            l = m
        else:
            r = m
    
    # Determine the swaps needed
    if l == 1:
        if array[0] != x:
            print(1)
            print(index_x + 1, 1)
        else:
            print(0)
    elif l == n + 1:
        if array[-1] != x:
            print(1)
            print(index_x + 1, n)
        else:
            print(0)
    else:
        if array[l - 2] != x:
            print(2)
            print(index_x + 1, l - 1)
            print(l - 1, l)
        else:
            print(1)
            print(index_x + 1, l - 1)
    
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and that the necessary swaps are made to place `x` at the correct position.
