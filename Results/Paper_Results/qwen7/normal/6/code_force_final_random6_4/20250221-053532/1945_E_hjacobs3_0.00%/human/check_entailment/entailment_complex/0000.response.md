Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation array with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds the target value `x` at the position `l`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The provided code attempts to implement a binary search, but there are several issues:
   - The initial values of `l` and `r` are incorrectly set to `0` and `-1` instead of `1` and `n+1`.
   - The binary search logic is flawed because it does not correctly update `l` and `r` based on the comparison with `find`.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to rearrange the array and return the indices of the swaps needed.
   - The function uses a binary search approach but does not correctly handle the search process.
   - The function does not actually perform any swaps; it only checks if `find` is already in the correct position and prints `0` or `1` accordingly.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm.
   - The function does not rearrange the array as required by the problem statement.
   - The function does not return the correct number of swaps or the correct indices for the swaps.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
