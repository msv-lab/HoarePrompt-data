Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. The values of `array`, `l`, and `mid` remain unchanged. The new value of `r` is derived from the previous value of `mid`.
