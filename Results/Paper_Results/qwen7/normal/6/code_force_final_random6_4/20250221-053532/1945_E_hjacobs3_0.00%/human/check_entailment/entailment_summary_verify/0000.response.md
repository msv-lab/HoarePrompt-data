### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- We need to rearrange the permutation so that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array.
- If `find` is not found, it prints "1" and returns a list with "1" and the index where `find` should be inserted to maintain the permutation order.
- If `find` is found, it prints "0" and returns a list with "1" and the index of `find` in the array, both incremented by 1.
- The function does not modify the original array; it only returns the necessary information for swapping.

#### Given Code Analysis:
- The main program reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` performs a binary search and checks if `find` is present in the array.
- If `find` is not found, it returns the index where `find` should be inserted.
- If `find` is found, it returns the index of `find` in the array.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly finds the position where `x` should be placed if it is not already in the array.
2. **Swapping Logic**: The function summary mentions that the function does not perform any swaps itself. Instead, it returns the necessary information for swapping.
3. **Output Format**: The function returns a list with the index where `find` should be swapped. The main program expects this list as the output.

Given the function summary, the original assessment incorrectly states that the function does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the array. The function actually handles this case by returning the index where `x` should be inserted.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` correctly identifies the position where `x` should be inserted if it is not found.
- The main program correctly interprets the output from `func_1` and prints the necessary swaps.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does handle the case where `x` is not found and returns the correct index for insertion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
