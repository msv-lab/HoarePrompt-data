### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation of size \( n \) and a number \( x \) to find.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
- After the rearrangement, we perform a binary search to find \( x \).
- The goal is to have \( p_l = x \) after the binary search.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   while t > 0:
       (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
       array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
       res = func_1(array, x)
       if res:
           print(' '.join(res))
       t -= 1
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \), followed by the permutation array.
   - It calls the `func_1` function and prints the result if the function returns anything.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(array, find):
       n = len(array)
       l, r = 0, n - 1
       while l <= r:
           mid = (l + r) // 2
           if array[mid] >= find:
               r = mid - 1
           else:
               l = mid + 1
       if l != array.index(find):
           print(1)
           return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
       else:
           print(0)
   ```
   - The function performs a binary search to find the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `find` is not found, it prints `1` and returns a list with the indices of the elements to swap.
   - If `find` is found, it prints `0` and returns a list with the indices of the elements to swap.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct and will find the correct position if `find` is in the array.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where `find` is not in the array correctly. It assumes that if `find` is not found, it should swap elements to place `find` at the correct position.

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The function only considers swapping once if `find` is not found. It should consider up to 2 swaps to ensure the correct position is achieved.
   - The function does not provide a mechanism to handle the case where the first swap does not place `find` in the correct position, requiring a second swap.

#### Corrected Approach:
- To handle the case where `find` is not in the array, we need to find the closest elements to swap.
- We can use a two-pointer approach to find the closest elements to swap.

#### Revised Function:
```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
    
    # Find the closest elements to swap
    if l == 0:
        # Swap with the smallest element
        for i in range(n):
            if array[i] == find:
                return [str(i + 1), str(1)]
    elif l == n - 1:
        # Swap with the largest element
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if array[i] == find:
                return [str(i + 1), str(n)]
    else:
        # Swap with the closest elements
        left_index = l - 1
        right_index = l
        if abs(array[left_index] - find) < abs(array[right_index] - find):
            return [str(left_index + 1), str(l + 1)]
        else:
            return [str(right_index + 1), str(l + 1)]
    
    # If find is not in the array, return 0
    print(0)
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the provided function does not correctly handle the case where `find` is not in the array. The revised function addresses this issue by considering up to 2 swaps to ensure the correct position is achieved.

**Final: False**
