You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 ≤ find ≤ n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:

    #State: Output State: The array remains a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `r` will eventually become less than `l` because the loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Once `r` becomes less than `l`, the condition `l <= r` in the while loop head fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, `r` will be one less than `l`, i.e., `r` will be -1, and `l` will be the next integer greater than `r`, which is 0. Therefore, the final state of the variables is `array` remains unchanged, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is "1" because `l` is 0 and thus `l + 1` is 1, and the second string is the index in the array where `find` is located, incremented by 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The array remains a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, and `r` is -1. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 ≤ find ≤ n`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not found, it prints "1" and returns a list containing "1" and the index where `find` should be inserted to maintain the permutation order. If `find` is found, it prints "0" and returns a list containing "1" and the index of `find` in the array, both incremented by 1. The original `array` remains unchanged, and the final values of `l` and `r` are 0 and -1, respectively.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the case where the element to be found (`x`) is not present in the array. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation so that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only checks if the middle element (`array[mid]`) is greater than or equal to `find`, which does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position.

Here is an example to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` and we need to find `3`. The binary search would proceed as follows:
1. `l = 0`, `r = 5`, `mid = 2` (since `(0 + 5) // 2 = 2`). `array[mid] = 1`, which is less than `3`, so `l = mid + 1 = 3`.
2. `l = 3`, `r = 5`, `mid = 4` (since `(3 + 5) // 2 = 4`). `array[mid] = 2`, which is less than `3`, so `l = mid + 1 = 5`.
3. `l = 5`, `r = 5`, `r - l = 0`, so the loop ends.

Since `l` is now `5` and `r` is `5`, the loop ends without finding `3`. The function returns `0`, indicating no operations were needed, but in reality, we need to swap elements to place `3` at the correct position.

To fix this, the function should check if `x` is present in the array and, if not, find the closest elements to swap to make `3` (or the target value) appear at the correct position. This requires additional logic to handle the case where `x` is not in the array.
