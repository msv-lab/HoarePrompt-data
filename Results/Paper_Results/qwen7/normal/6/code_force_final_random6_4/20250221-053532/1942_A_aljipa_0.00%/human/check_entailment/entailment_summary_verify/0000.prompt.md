You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        print(*res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \), where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 \). For each test case, it generates a list `res` based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \): if \( k \) equals \( n \), it creates a list of \( n \) ones; if \( k \) equals 1, it creates a list of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \); otherwise, it creates a list containing only -1. The function prints the list `res` for each test case and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final state where the loop counter `t` is reduced to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to handle different values of `k` by using different strategies, but it does not cover all necessary scenarios.

1. When `k == n`, the program generates an array of ones (`[1] * n`). This is correct because if all cyclic shifts are sorted, the array must be entirely composed of the same element.
2. When `k == 1`, the program generates a range of numbers (`range(n)`). This is also correct because having exactly one sorted cyclic shift means that the array must be in ascending order.
3. For other values of `k`, the program returns `-1`. However, this is not always correct. There can be arrays that meet the criteria for `k` values other than 1 or `n`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 2`. A valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`. The cyclic shifts are:
- Shift 1: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` (sorted)
- Shift 2: `[2, 3, 1, 1]` (not sorted)
- Shift 3: `[3, 1, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
- Shift 4: `[1, 1, 2, 3]` (not sorted)

This array has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts, but the program incorrectly returns `-1` for this case.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
