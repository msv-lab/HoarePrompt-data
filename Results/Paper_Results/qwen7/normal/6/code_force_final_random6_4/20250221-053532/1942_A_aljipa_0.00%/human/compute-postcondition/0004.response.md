To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` equals `n`, then `res` is `[1] * n`, meaning `res` is a list with `n` elements, all of which are `1`.
   - If `k` equals `1`, then `res` is `range(n)`, which is a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`, a single-element list containing `-1`.

2. `t` is an integer such that `0 < t â‰¤ 10^3`, but this variable does not affect the value of `res`.

3. `n` and `k` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided, so we need to consider the different cases for `res`.

Given the `print(*res)` statement, we need to consider the three possible cases for `res`:

- If `k == n`, `res` is `[1] * n`, so the output will be `1 1 1 ... 1` (with `n` ones).
- If `k == 1`, `res` is `range(n)`, so the output will be `0 1 2 ... n-1`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., `k != n` and `k != 1`), `res` is `[-1]`, so the output will be `-1`.

Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we need to account for all possible cases. However, the format of the output is consistent based on the value of `res`.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (if k == n), 0 1 2 ... n-1 (if k == 1), or -1 (otherwise)**
