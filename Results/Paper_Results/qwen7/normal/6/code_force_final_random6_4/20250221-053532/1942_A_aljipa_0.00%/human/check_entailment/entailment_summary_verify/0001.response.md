### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then generates a result list `res` based on the values of `k` relative to `n`:
     - If `k == n`, it sets `res` to `[1] * n`. This means every cyclic shift will be sorted because all elements are the same.
     - If `k == 1`, it sets `res` to `range(n)`. This creates an array where the first cyclic shift is sorted, but subsequent shifts will not be.
     - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating that no valid array can be found.

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - For `k == n`, the solution is correct. An array with all elements the same (e.g., `[1, 1, ..., 1]`) will have all cyclic shifts sorted.
   - For `k == 1`, the solution is also correct. The array `range(n)` ensures only the first cyclic shift is sorted.
   - However, the code does not handle the general case where `1 < k < n`. In such cases, no array can satisfy the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted. The current implementation incorrectly returns `[-1]` for these cases, which is not correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The given program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly handle the general case where `1 < k < n`. In these cases, no such array exists, and the program should output `-1` instead of `[-1]`.

**Correctness:** False

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
