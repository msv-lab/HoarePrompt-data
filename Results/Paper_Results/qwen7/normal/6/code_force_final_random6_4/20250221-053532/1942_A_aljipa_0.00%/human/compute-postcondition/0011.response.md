Output State: **`res` is either `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `[-1]`, `t` is `t - 2`**.

This means that the value of `res` depends on the value of `k`:
- If `k` equals `n`, then `res` is a list of `n` ones.
- If `k` equals `1`, then `res` is a range object from `0` to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `res` is a list containing only `-1`.

Additionally, the value of `t` is updated to `t - 2` due to the code `t = t - 1 - 1`.
