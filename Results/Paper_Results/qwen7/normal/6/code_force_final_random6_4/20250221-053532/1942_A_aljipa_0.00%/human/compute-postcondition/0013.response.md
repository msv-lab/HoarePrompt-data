Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `res` will be `[1] * n` if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` will be `range(n)` if `k` equals `1`, otherwise `res` will be `[-1]`, `t` will be `0`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced to `0` because it starts as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and decreases by `1` with each iteration. The value of `res` will depend on the values of `n` and `k` provided during each iteration of the loop.
