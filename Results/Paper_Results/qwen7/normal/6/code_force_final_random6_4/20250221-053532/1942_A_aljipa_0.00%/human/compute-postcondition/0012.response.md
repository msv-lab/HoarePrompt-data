To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Condition for `res`:**
   - If `k` equals `n`, then `res` is `[1] * n`.
   - If `k` equals `1`, then `res` is `range(n)`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`.

2. **Condition for `t`:**
   - `t` is `t - 2`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

We need to consider the possible values of `res` based on the conditions provided. Since the exact value of `k` and `t` is not specified, we need to consider the general cases:

- If `k == n`, then `res` is `[1] * n`.
- If `k == 1`, then `res` is `range(n)`, which is an iterable of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we need to consider the most general case where `k` does not equal `n` or `1`. Therefore, `res` will be `[-1]`.

So, the code will print the elements of `res`, which is `[-1]`.

Output: **-1**
