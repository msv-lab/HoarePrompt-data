Output State: **`cou` is 1, `i` remains 0, `n` must be greater than -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, the loop or conditional block that contains the `if` statement checking `freq[i] == 1` is exited. The values of `cou`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than -1 still holds true.
