Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as required. Instead, it attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `arr` directly based on the frequency of elements, which is not aligned with the game rules.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
```

This happens because the program only checks the frequency of elements in `arr` and prints the first index `i` where `freq[i]` is either 1 or 0, which is 0 in this case. This is incorrect because the game involves strategic moves by both players, and the final MEX depends on the optimal choices made during the game.

The correct approach would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob according to the game rules and calculating the MEX of the resulting array `c`. The current implementation does not handle this simulation and thus fails to produce the correct output for the given problem.
