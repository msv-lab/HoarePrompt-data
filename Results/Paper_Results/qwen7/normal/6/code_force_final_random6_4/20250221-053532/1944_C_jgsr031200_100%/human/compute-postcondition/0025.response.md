Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cou` is 1.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `n` must be greater than -1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Check the conditions for breaking the loop**:
   - The loop will break if `cou == 2` or `freq[i] == 0`.
   - Given that `cou` is currently 1, it will only break if `freq[1] == 0` (since `i` will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than -1 for the loop to continue.
   - `cou` remains 1 unless `freq[1] == 0`, but since no information about `freq[1]` is provided, we assume it does not break the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cou` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than -1**
