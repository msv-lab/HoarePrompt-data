Output State: **Each element in `arr` has been processed exactly once, and `freq[i]` contains the count of how many times `i` appeared in `arr`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, every element in the list `arr` will have incremented its corresponding index in the `freq` list exactly once. Therefore, `freq[i]` will hold the frequency of the integer `i` in the original list `arr`.
