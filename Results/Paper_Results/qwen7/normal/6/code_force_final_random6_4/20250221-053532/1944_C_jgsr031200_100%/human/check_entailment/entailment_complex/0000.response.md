Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The score is defined as the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` as per the game rules. Instead, it seems to be attempting to solve a different problem involving counting the frequency of elements in the input array and finding the smallest missing integer.
3. The function `func_1` does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob. It simply processes the input array and prints the smallest integer that appears exactly once or the smallest missing integer, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.
4. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, nor does it construct the array `c` according to the game rules.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
