Based on the initial state provided:

- `cou` is 3
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

The print statement is `print(i)`. Since the value of `i` is explicitly stated as 2, and there is no condition that would change this value before the print statement is executed, the value of `i` will be printed as 2.

Output: **2**
