Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the third element of `arr`; `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the frequency count of the element `i` in the `freq` list. Since `i` is specified as the third element of `arr`, and `arr` contains at least one element, the frequency of the third element in `arr` (which is `i`) is increased by 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
