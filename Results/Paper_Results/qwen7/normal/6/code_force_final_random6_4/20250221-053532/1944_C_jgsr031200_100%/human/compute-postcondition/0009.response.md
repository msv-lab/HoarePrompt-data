Output State: **`cou` is 0**

The initial state indicates that each element in `arr` has been processed exactly once, and `freq[i]` contains the count of how many times `i` appeared in `arr`. However, the given code snippet only initializes the variable `cou` to 0. No other operations are performed on `cou` or any other variables, so the value of `cou` remains unchanged.
