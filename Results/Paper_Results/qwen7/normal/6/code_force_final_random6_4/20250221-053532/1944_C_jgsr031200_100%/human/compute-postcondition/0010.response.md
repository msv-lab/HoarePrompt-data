State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than -1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop condition is `i in range(n + 1)`, which means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
3. For the loop to start executing, `n + 1` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0).
4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than -1.
5. The variable `cou` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its initial value does not affect whether the loop will execute or not. Thus, it does not need to be adjusted.

Hence, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting from 0, `n` being greater than -1, and `cou` remaining as 0.
