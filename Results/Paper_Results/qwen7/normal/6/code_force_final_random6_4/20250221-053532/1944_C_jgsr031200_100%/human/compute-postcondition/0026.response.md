Output State: **`cou` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than -1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their previous values remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than -1 also remains valid.
