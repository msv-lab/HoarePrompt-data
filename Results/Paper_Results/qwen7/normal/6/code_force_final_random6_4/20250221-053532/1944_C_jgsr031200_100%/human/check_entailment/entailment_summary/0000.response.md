Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the optimal final score of the game based on the given rules.
- The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code attempts to count the frequency of elements in the array and identify certain conditions, but it does not simulate the game's turns or calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
- The execution summary describes a function that prints an integer based on the frequency of elements in the input array, but this does not align with the game's rules or the definition of MEX.
- The correct approach would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always picks an element that maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. This involves strategic picking of elements rather than just counting frequencies.

Given the discrepancy between the intended solution and the provided code, the conclusion is that the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
