Output State: **`cou` is 2, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, we assume it is inside a loop or conditional structure. The `break` statement does not change the values of `cou` or `i`; it only exits the loop or conditional block. The precondition that `n` must be greater than -1 and if `freq[i]` is equal to 1, `cou` remains 2, remains unchanged.
