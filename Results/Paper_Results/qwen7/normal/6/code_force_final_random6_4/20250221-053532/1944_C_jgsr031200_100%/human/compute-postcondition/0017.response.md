Output State: **`cou` is 1, `i` remains 0, `n` must be greater than -1.**

Explanation: The code `cou += 1` increments the value of `cou` by 1. Since `cou` initially remained 0, after executing this line, `cou` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
