Output State: **The loop will terminate when `cou` reaches 2 or when `freq[i]` becomes 0 for some `i`. After all iterations, `cou` will be 2, `i` will be the smallest index where `freq[i]` is 0 or the value of `i` just before the loop breaks due to `cou == 2`. The value of `n` must be such that the loop can iterate up to `n+1` times.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `cou` will definitely be 2 (since the loop breaks as soon as `cou` reaches 2), and `i` will be the last index that caused the loop to break, either because `freq[i]` was 0 or because `cou` reached 2. The exact value of `i` depends on the values in the `freq` list and the value of `n`.
