Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `[u, v]` is a list containing two integers obtained from input, and the input has been converted to integers and assigned to `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input and splits them into a list `[u, v]`. These values are then converted to integers using the `map(int, input().split())` function. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the structure of the list `[u, v]` remain unchanged, but now `u` and `v` hold the integer values entered by the user.
