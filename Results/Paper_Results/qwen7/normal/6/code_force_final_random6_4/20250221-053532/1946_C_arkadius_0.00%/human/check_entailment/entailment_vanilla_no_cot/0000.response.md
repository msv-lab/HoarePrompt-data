To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions provided. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

### Analysis of Functions

1. **`func_1`**: This function seems to be trying to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges. However, the implementation appears to be incorrect because it does not properly handle the removal of edges and the calculation of the remaining size and good components.

2. **`func_2`**: This function is a recursive helper function to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size in a subtree. It also seems to have issues with the logic for updating `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

3. **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to remove edges such that the number of good components is greater than or equal to `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`. The logic here is flawed because it uses `func_1`, which is incorrect.

4. **`func_4`**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that the conditions are met. The logic here is correct but relies on the correctness of `func_3`, which is incorrect.

5. **`func_5`**: This function reads the input and constructs the tree. It then calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`. The input reading and tree construction logic seem correct.

### Issues Identified

- **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` and `func_2`**: These functions do not correctly simulate the removal of edges and the calculation of the remaining size and good components.
- **Reliance on Incorrect Functions**: `func_3` and `func_4` rely on `func_1`, which means the entire solution is flawed due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, particularly in the core functions (`func_1` and `func_2`), the overall solution is incorrect. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct.

**Correctness: False**
