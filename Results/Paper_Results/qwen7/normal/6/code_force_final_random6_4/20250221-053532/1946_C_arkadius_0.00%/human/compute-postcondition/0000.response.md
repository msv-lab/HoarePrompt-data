Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `tree` is an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree; `[n, k]` is a list containing the integer values input by the user.**

The code reads two integers from the input and splits them into a list `[n, k]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, but now they are stored in the list `[n, k]`. The `tree` object remains unchanged.
