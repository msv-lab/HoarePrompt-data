Output State: **`stack` contains (new_u, True), (next_u, False), (u, False)**

The stack initially contains the tuples `(new_u, True)` and `(next_u, False)`. After executing the line `stack.append((u, False))`, the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the stack. Therefore, the updated stack contains the three tuples mentioned above.
