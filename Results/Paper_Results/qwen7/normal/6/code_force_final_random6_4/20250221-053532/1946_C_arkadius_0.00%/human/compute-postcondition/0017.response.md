Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, the number of vertices in the tree; `k`, the number of edges to be removed; and `tree`, an instance of a custom Tree class representing the tree structure. It constructs the tree by adding edges based on user input, roots the tree non-recursively, and then calls another function `func_4` to process the tree with `n` and `k`. The function ultimately returns the result of `func_4`, which is dependent on the operations performed on the tree.**
