You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a class representing a tree data structure, v is an integer such that 1 <= v <= n and represents a vertex in the tree, and x is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
def func_2(tree, v, x):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: Output State: `good_components` is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x` (which equals the number of children in `tree.vertices[v].children`); `remaining_size` is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was less than `x` (which also equals the number of children in `tree.vertices[v].children`).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `good_components` will be the total count of good components found across all subtrees, plus the number of subtrees where `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`. Similarly, `remaining_size` will be the sum of `remaining_size_subtree` values from all iterations, plus the number of subtrees where `remaining_size_subtree` was less than `x`. The exact numerical values depend on the specific results of `func_2` for each subtree.
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns `good_components` which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size` which is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was less than `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree data structure), a vertex `v`, and an integer `x`. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size`, which is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was less than `x`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `good_components` which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size` which is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was less than `x`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
