Output State: The final values of `beg` and `end` will be such that `beg` is less than or equal to `end`, and `end` is the largest integer for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns false when `mid` is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true for some `mid`, then `beg` will be equal to that `mid`. Otherwise, `end` will be the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false.

This means that after the loop completes, `beg` and `end` will converge to a point where further division does not satisfy the condition of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, or they will be equal if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true for every possible `mid` within the range.
