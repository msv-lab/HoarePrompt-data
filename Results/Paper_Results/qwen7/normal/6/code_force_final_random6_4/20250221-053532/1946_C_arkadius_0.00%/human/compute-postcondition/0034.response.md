Output State: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`, plus the number of children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `good_components` attribute of the vertex `v` will reflect the total good components contributed by all its descendants, adjusted based on their `remaining_size` compared to `x`. The `remaining_size` of `v` will be the sum of the `remaining_size` attributes of all its children.
