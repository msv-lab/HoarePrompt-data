Postcondition: **The stack is a list containing tuples representing vertices from the tree. For the vertex `v` initially at the top of the stack, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated based on the remaining sizes of its child vertices relative to `x`. Specifically, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` (for a child vertex `u`) is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`; otherwise, it is incremented by 1. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all child vertices `u` of `v`. If the condition `postorder` is true, these updates are performed for each child vertex of `v`. If `postorder` is false, no changes are made to `tree.vertices[v].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size`.**
