Output State: **The program returns the value of `beg`, which is the smallest integer such that `func_3(tree, n, k, beg)` returns true, or the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false if no such `mid` exists.**

This means that after the loop completes, `beg` will be the smallest integer satisfying the condition or the last value for which `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returned false, ensuring that `beg` is the boundary where the function transitions from returning false to true.
