Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `[u, v]` is a list containing two integers obtained from input.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the list `u, v`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `k` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `u, v` along with the unchanged variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.
