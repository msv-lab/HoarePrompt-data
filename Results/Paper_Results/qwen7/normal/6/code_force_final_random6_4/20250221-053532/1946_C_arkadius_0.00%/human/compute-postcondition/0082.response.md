Output State: The stack will contain a series of tuples where each tuple is of the form `(u, False)`. Specifically, the stack will contain one tuple for each child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, with each tuple indicating that the corresponding child node has not yet been fully processed.

In more detail, if `v` has `n` children, the stack will contain exactly `n` tuples, each representing a child node of `v` and marked as not fully processed (`False`). The exact contents of these tuples depend on the order in which the children are processed, but all will follow the pattern `(child_node, False)`.
