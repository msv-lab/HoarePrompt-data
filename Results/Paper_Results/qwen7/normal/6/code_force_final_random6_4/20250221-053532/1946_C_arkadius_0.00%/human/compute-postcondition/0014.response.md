Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains unchanged, `[u, v]` contains the integers `u-1` and `v-1` which were provided as input during the last iteration, and the tree now includes all the edges specified by the inputs, and the root tree has been processed non-recursively starting from vertex 0 with a parent of -1.**

Explanation: The function `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` processes the tree starting from vertex 0 with a parent of -1 using a non-recursive method. This does not change the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, or the contents of `[u, v]`. It only indicates that the root of the tree has been processed.
