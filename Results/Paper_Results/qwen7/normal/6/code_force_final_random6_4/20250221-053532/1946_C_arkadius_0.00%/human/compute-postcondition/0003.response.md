Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `tree` is an instance of a custom Tree class that represents the tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree, `[u, v]` is a list containing two integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to the list `[u, v]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the `tree` object remain unchanged. The input values for `u` and `v` are stored in the list `[u, v]`.
