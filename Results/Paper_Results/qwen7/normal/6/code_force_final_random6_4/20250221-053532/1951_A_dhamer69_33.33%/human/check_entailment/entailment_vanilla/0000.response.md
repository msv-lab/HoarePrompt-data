Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Given Problem Description:
The problem description is not explicitly provided in the question, but from the code, it seems the task is to process a series of test cases where each test case involves a string `s` and an integer `n`. The goal is to determine whether certain conditions about the string `s` are met based on the value of `n`.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        if n == 2:
            if s == '00':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            count_1 = s.count('1')
            if count_1 % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
            elif s.count('11') == 1:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        t -= 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The function reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s`.
   
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - If `n == 2`, it checks if `s` is exactly `'00'`. If so, it prints `'YES'`, otherwise `'NO'`.
   - If `n != 2`, it counts the number of `'1'` characters in `s`:
     - If the count of `'1'` is odd, it prints `'NO'`.
     - If there is exactly one occurrence of `'11'` in `s`, it prints `'NO'`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `'YES'`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the specified conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as expected and applies the conditions accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
