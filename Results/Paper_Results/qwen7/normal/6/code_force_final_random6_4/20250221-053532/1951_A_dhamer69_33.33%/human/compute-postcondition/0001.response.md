Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` is an input integer.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `t > 0` must be true.
   - Currently, `t` is an input integer, but we don't know its value yet.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop condition, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
