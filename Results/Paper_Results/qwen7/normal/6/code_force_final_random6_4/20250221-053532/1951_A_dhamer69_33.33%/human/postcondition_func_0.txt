The function processes multiple inputs consisting of an integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and strings `s`. For each pair, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. After processing all inputs, the function outputs the final state where `t` is 0, and the variables `n` and `s` reflect the last inputs provided. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
