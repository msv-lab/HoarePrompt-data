Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2. If the number of '1's in the string `s` is odd, the postcondition remains unchanged. If the number of '1's is even, the postcondition includes the additional condition that the string `s` either contains exactly one occurrence of '11' or does not contain exactly one occurrence of '11'.
