Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `t` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `i` or `t`. The value of `i` remains `N-1`, and `t` retains its previous value since the code snippet does not modify `t`. Additionally, the condition regarding `t` and `cnt[i]` remains valid after the `break` statement is executed.
