Output State: **`cnt[a[i+1]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `N` is the same**.

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. The other variables (`i`, `cnt[a[i+1]]`, and `N`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
