Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `N` is the input integer, `tc` is `N` - 1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input from the user using `input()`. These integers are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)` and collected into a list `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `N`, and `tc` remain unchanged from their initial states.
