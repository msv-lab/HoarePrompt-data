Output State: `i` is equal to `N-1`; `cnt[a[i]]` (which is `cnt[a[N-1]]`) is incremented by 1.

In this final output state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `N-1`. The dictionary `cnt` has been updated for each element in the list `a`, with each element's count incremented according to its appearance in the list.
