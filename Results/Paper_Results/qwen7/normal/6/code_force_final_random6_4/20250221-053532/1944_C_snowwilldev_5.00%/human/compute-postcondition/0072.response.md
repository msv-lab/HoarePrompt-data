Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < N`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, if `t` is 1 and `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` remains 1, `i` remains 1, and `N` remains greater than 0.
   - Otherwise, `t`, `i`, and `N` remain 0, 1, and greater than 0, respectively.

3. **Analyze the possible scenarios**:
   - If `t` is 1 and `cnt[i]` is 1, then `i` is still 1, and `N` is still greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are not met, then `t`, `i`, and `N` are reset to 0, 1, and greater than 0, respectively.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop head variables are `i` and `N`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 and check if `i < N`.
   - If `t` was 1 and `cnt[i]` was 1, then `i` would remain 1, but since the loop is iterating over `range(N)`, `i` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 2, `N` must be greater than 0**.
