Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `N`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially equal to `N-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from `N-1` down to `0`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[0, N-1]`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop starts with `i` being `N-1`, the loop will execute at least once (when `i` is `N-1`). However, to ensure the loop continues to execute, `i` must eventually reach `0`. 

5. **Final State**: The initial state of `i` is `N-1`, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `[0, N-1]`. Thus, `i` must be adjusted to start at `N-1` and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` remains within the valid range.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` is an integer such that `i` remains within the range `[0, N-1]` during the loop execution**
