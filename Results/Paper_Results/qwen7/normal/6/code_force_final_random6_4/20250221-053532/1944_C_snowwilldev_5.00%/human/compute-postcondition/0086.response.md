Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N)`. The objects involved here are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to 2.
   - `N` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 2, for the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than 2.
   - The variable `i` will be incremented within the loop, but its initial value is 2, so we don't need to adjust it further.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `t`, `tc`, `a`, and `cnt` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `N` must be greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `N` must be greater than 2, `tc` is `N` - 1, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value int**
