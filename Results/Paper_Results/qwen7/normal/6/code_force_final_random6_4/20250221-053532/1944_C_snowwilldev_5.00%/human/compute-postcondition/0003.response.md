Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input()`, splits it into a list of strings using `.split()`, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The variable `tc` remains unchanged, and `N` is still an input integer.
