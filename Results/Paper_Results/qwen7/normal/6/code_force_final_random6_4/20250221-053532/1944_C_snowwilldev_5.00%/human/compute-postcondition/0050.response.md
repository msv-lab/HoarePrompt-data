Output State: **`cnt[a[i+1]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `N` is the same**.

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. The values of `cnt[a[i+1]]` and `i` are also incremented as per the initial state, and `N` remains unchanged.
