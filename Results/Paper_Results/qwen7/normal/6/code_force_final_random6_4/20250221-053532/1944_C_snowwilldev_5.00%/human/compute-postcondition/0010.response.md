Output State: **`i` is 3, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the line of code, `i` is now 3. The value of `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `N` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
