Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `cnt[i]` is set to 1, `t` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the block where `cnt[i]` was being checked and updated. The values of `i` and `cnt[i]` are updated as per the initial postcondition, and `t` is set to 1 because `cnt[i]` was initially 1. The `break` statement does not change the values of `i` and `cnt[i]` but ensures that the execution exits the current block.
