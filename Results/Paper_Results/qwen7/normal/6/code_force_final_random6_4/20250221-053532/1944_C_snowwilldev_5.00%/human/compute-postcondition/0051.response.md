Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the constant `N`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `N`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt[a[i+1]]` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
   - `N` remains the same.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `N`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt[a[i+1]]` is incremented by 1 (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes `i + 1`).
- `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `N` remains the same.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `cnt[a[i+1]]` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`.
- `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
- `N` remains the same.

State: **`cnt[a[i+1]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `N` is the same**
