To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `cnt[i]` is set to 1.
   - `t` is 1 if `cnt[i]` was initially 1, otherwise `i` remains incremented by 1 and `t` remains its original value.

2. **Operations**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `cnt[i]` is set to 1.
   - The value of `t` depends on the initial value of `cnt[i]`:
     - If `cnt[i]` was initially 1, then `t` is set to 1.
     - Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged (its original value).

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement only outputs the value of `i`.

Given the operations, the key point is the value of `i` after it is incremented by 1 and `cnt[i]` is set to 1. The value of `t` does not affect the print statement.

Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `i` before incrementing, we can only say that `i` is incremented by 1 and `cnt[i]` is set to 1. However, the print statement only outputs `i`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` after it is incremented by 1.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the value of i before incrementing)**
