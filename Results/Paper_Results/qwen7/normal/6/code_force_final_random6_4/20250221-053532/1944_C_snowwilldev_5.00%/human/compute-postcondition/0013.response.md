Output State: **`i` is equal to `N-1`; `cnt[a[N-1]]` is incremented by 1; `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value 0, which does not affect the values of `i` or `cnt[a[N-1]]`. The loop has completed all its iterations, so `i` remains equal to `N-1`, and the dictionary `cnt` has been updated for each element in the list `a`, with each element's count incremented according to its appearance in the list.
