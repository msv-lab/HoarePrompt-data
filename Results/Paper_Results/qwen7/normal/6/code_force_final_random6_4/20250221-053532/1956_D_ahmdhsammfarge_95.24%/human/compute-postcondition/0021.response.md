Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `r` is `[0, len(lst)]`
- `l` is `len(lst)`
- `over_sum` is `(len(lst) - 0 + 1)`

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.

### Adjusting the State
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The initial value of `i` is `0`.
- After the first iteration, `i` becomes `1`.

### Updated State
- Since `i` was incremented from `0` to `1`, the new value of `i` is `1`.
- The range `r` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of `lst`, which does not change within the loop.
- The variable `l` remains unchanged because it is also determined by the length of `lst`.
- The variable `over_sum` remains unchanged because it is a constant based on the initial values of `r`.

### Final State
State: **`r` is `[0, len(lst)]`, `l` is `len(lst)`, `over_sum` is `(len(lst) - 0 + 1)`**
