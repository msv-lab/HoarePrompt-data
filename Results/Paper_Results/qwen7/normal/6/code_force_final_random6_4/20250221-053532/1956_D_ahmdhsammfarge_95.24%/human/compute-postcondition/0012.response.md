Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is len(lst), `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is len(lst), `sm` is (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` unpacks the list `[i, j]` into the variables `r` and `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(lst)`, so `r` becomes 0 and `l` becomes `len(lst)`. The values of `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
