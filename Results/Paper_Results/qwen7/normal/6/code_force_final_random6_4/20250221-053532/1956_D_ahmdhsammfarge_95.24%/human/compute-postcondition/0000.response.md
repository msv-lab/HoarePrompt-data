Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0**.

The initial state is that `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, and the length of `lst` is `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The code assigns the value `0` to both `r` and `l`. No other variables are affected, so the length of `lst` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `r` is 0, `l` is 0, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with length `n`.
