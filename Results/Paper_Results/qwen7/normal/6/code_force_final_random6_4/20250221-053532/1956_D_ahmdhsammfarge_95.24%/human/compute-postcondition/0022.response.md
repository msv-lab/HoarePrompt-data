Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `r` is `[0, len(lst)]`.
   - `l` is `len(lst)`.
   - `over_sum` is `(len(lst) - 0 + 1)`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` up to but not including `len(lst)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `len(lst)`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `len(lst)`, we need to ensure that `i + 1 < len(lst)`.
   - The value of `j` will start from `i + 1` and increment until it reaches `len(lst)`, but the initial value of `j` is not directly given; it starts from `i + 1`.

5. **Final Adjusted State:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `i + 1` should be less than `len(lst)`.
   - The initial values of `j` and `lst` are not explicitly given, but we know the range of `j` will start from `i + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `i + 1` is less than `len(lst)`.

**State:**
**`r` is `[0, len(lst)]`, `l` is `len(lst)`, `over_sum` is `(len(lst) - 0 + 1)`, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`**
