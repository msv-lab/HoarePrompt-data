Output State: **`r` is [0, len(lst) + 1], `l` is the length of `lst`, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is len(lst) + 1, `sm` is (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `r` to be `[i, j]`, which means `r` becomes `[0, len(lst) + 1]`. The other variables (`l`, `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
