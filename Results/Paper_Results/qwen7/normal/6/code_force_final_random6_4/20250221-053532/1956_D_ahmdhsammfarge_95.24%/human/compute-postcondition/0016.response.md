Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is the length of `lst`, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is len(lst) + 1, `sm` is (j - i + 1) ** 2 + sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:])**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `sm` using the formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(lst) + 1`, the expression simplifies to `(len(lst) + 1 - 0 + 1) ** 2 + sum(lst[0:j]) + sum(lst[j+1:])`. Since `j` is `len(lst) + 1`, `lst[j+1:]` is an empty slice, and `sum(lst[0:j])` is the sum of the entire list `lst`. Thus, `sm` is the sum of the list `lst` plus the square of `len(lst) + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
