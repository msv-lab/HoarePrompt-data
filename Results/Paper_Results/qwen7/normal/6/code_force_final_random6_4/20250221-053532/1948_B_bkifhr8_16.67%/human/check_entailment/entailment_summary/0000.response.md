Reasoning:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed before determining its correctness:

1. The main loop iterates through the array and attempts to modify it based on the condition that the previous element is greater than the current element and is greater than 10. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array will eventually become sorted. The program should focus on ensuring that the array can be transformed into a sorted state, rather than just checking elements one by one.
2. The function `func_1` is used to check if the modified list is sorted, but it is called after attempting to transform the list. This means that `func_1` is not being used correctly because the transformation logic is not fully implemented.
3. The transformation logic itself is flawed. Simply splitting a number into its digits and inserting them back into the list may not lead to a sorted array, especially if the original array had elements that are not multiples of 10.

Given these points, let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It then attempts to transform the array by checking if the previous element is greater than the current element and is greater than 10. If so, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
4. Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if the transformed list is sorted.

However, the transformation logic is incomplete and does not guarantee that the array will become sorted. The program should instead focus on ensuring that the array can be transformed into a sorted state, which might require a different approach.

Given the flaws in the transformation logic and the incorrect usage of `func_1`, the program cannot be considered correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
