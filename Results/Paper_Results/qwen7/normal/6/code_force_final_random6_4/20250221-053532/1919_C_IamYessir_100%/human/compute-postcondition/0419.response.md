Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list, and if `x` is equal to `y`, then the list `a` has its last element appended with the element at index `i` of list `b`. Otherwise, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[0]`, and if `x` is less than `lit[0]`, then `lit[0]` is either an element of list `a` or greater than or equal to `y` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `lit[0]` is greater than `x`.
