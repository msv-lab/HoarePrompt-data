Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `b` is an empty list or not, `x` is infinity, `y` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of infinity to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `b`, or `x`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same as the initial state.
