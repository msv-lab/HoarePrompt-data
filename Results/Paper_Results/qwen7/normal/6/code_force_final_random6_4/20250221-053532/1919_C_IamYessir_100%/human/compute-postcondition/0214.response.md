Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `y`, and `lit[i]` is appended to list `a` and now becomes the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and greater than or equal to `x`, and `x` and `y` are the last elements of `a` before appending, the new last element of `a` is `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
