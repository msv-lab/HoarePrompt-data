Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`. This means `i` will take values from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `n` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `s` is `1`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` from its current value.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2`.
   - Since `n` is defined as `len(a) - 1`, it remains unchanged.
   - The value of `s` does not change based on the loop condition and is not affected by the loop itself.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `2`.
   - `n` remains `len(a) - 1`.
   - `s` remains `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is 1**.
