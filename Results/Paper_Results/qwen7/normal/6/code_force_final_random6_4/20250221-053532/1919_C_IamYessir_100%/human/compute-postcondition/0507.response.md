Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `b` must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is 1, `x` is the last element of `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), `y` is the last element of `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty), and `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` if the condition is true, otherwise no change in the values of `s`, `x`, and `y` is made.**
