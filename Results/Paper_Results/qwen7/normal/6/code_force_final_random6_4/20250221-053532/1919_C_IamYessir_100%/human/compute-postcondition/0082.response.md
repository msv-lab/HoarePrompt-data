Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is infinity.**

The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `x`. Therefore, the conditions for `i` and `n` remain the same, and `x` retains its original value, which is either infinity or the last element of list `a`.
