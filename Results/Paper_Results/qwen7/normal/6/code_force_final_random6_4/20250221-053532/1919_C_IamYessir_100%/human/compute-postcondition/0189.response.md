Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is a list; `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is still a list, and `x` now holds the value of the last element of `a`.
