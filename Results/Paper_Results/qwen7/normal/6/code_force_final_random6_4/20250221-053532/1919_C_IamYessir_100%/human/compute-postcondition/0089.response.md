Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`; if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `i` is set to 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
