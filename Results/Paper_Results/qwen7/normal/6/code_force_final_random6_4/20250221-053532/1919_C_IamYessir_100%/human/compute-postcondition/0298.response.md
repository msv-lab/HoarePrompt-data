Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with one more element than before, where the last element is `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` will have one more element which is `lit[i]`, and `x` will be updated to `lit[i]`. Since there is no else part, the conditions and updates remain as specified in the if part.
