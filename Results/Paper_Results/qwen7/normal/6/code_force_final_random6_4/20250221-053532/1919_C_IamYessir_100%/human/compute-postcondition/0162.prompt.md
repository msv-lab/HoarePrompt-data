Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` will be 0 since it starts decreasing by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, `a` will contain elements that are smaller or equal to `b[-1]` if `b` is not empty, and `b` will contain elements that are larger than `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, both `a` and `b` lists will be filled based on the conditions provided within the loop, ensuring that the last element of `a` is the largest element added to `a` during the loop's execution, and the last element of `b` is the smallest element added to `b` during the loop's execution, the variables `x` and `y` will reflect the last elements of `a` and `b` respectively, or will be infinity if their respective lists are empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 2`, and `s` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k + 3`, and `s` is incremented by 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by an additional 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
