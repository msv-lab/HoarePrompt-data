Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, and `b` is a list with its last element being `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, the element appended to `b` is `a[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
