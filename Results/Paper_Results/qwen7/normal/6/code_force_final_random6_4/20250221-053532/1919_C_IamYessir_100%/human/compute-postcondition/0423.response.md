Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `x` is not infinity
   - `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`
   - `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i`
   - If `x` is less than the first element of list `b` (`lit[0]`), then:
     - `lit[0]` is either an element of list `a` or greater than or equal to `y`
     - `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`
     - `lit[0]` is greater than `x`
   - If `x` is not less than `lit[0]`, then:
     - `a` contains the element `lit[0]` appended to its previous contents

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n):
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` are not directly modified by the loop itself (assuming no modifications within the loop body).

4. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 1
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1
   - `x` remains not infinity
   - `y` remains either infinity or the last element of list `a`
   - `b` now contains elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1)
   - The conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same unless the loop body modifies them.

Given this analysis, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is not infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1), and the conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same.**
