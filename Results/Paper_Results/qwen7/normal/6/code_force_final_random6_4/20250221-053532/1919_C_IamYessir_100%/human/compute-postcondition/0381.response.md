Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `x` is infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, if `a` is an empty list, `x` is not infinity. If `a` is not an empty list, `y` is assigned the last element of list `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.
