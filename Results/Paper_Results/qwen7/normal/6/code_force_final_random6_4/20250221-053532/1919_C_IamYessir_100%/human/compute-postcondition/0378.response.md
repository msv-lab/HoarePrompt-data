Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a list with one element `lit[i]`, `x` is not infinity, `y` is the last element of list `a` (if `a` is not empty), otherwise `y` is infinity.**

Explanation:
- `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, `b` now contains one element, which is `lit[0]`.
- The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their previous conditions because the code does not modify these variables. If `a` is not empty, `y` is set to the last element of `a`; otherwise, `y` remains infinity.
