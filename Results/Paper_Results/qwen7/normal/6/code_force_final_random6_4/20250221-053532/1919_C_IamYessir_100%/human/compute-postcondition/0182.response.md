Output State: **`i` is `len(b)`, `s` is the total count of times `b[i]` was found to be greater than `b[i - 1]` over all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`. The values of `i`, `s`, `n`, and `lit` remain unchanged from their initial states.
