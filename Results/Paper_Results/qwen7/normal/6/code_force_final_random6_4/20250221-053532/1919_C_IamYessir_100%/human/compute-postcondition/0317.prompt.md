Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `s` is the total count of times `b[i]` was found to be greater than `b[i - 1]` over all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `x` is greater than `y`, then `b` is a list with one additional element which is `lit[0]` if `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `a` is updated to include `lit[0]` as its new last element, and `b` remains unchanged. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` and `y` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than `y`, then either `a` has an additional element which is `a[0]`, or `b` is a list that now contains the element `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `y` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, or `b` remains unchanged if no such `i` satisfies the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is the last element of list `a` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, or infinity if `b` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x > y`, `a` has one more element than before, where the last element is `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, `a` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
