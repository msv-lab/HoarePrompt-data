Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `y` is positive infinity, the length of list `a` is 0, `x` is positive infinity, the length of list `b` is 0.**

The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `x`, or `b`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `y`.
