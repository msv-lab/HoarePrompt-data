Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element plus the element `lit[1]`, `x` is the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `a`. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` was initially 1 (since `i` is 1 in the initial state), `a.append(lit[1])` adds `lit[1]` to the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
