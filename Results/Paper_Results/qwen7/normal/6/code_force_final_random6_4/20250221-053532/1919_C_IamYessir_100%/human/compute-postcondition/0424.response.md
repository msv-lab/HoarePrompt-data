Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is infinity, `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1), and the conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `x`. This changes the value of `x` to infinity. All other variables retain their previous states as per the initial conditions.
