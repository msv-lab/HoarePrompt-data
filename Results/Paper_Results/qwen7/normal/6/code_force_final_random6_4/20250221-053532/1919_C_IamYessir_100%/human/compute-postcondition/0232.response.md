Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, and now `a` has an additional element which is `lit[0]`, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 0, the first element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[0]`) is appended to `a`. Since `x` and `y` are both initially set to the last element of `a` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, these relationships remain true after the append operation.
