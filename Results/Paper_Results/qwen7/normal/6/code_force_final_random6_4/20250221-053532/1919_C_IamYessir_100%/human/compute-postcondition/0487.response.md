Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1 as it was initially. `x` will be the last element of list `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), and `y` will be the last element of list `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty). 

The lists `a` and `b` will contain elements from `lit` based on the conditions specified within the loop. Specifically, elements from `lit` will be appended to `a` or `b` depending on their comparison with the current values of `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than `y`, elements from `lit` will be added to `b` under certain conditions, and if `x` is less than or equal to `y`, elements will be added to `a` under similar conditions. If `x` equals `y`, the element from `lit` will be added to `a`.
