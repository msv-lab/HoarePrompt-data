Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element, `x` is the last element of list `a`, and `y` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `lit[0]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `b` is a list with one additional element which is `lit[0]`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to include `lit[0]` as its new last element, and `b` remains unchanged.
