Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(b)` + 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the count of elements in list `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element (which is 0 since `b` is empty), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`. Since `b` was initially a list with at least one element, after executing the code, `b` becomes an empty list. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only dependent on the length of `b`, which is now 0. The count `s` of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its preceding element is 0 because `b` is now empty. The variables `n` and `lit` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
