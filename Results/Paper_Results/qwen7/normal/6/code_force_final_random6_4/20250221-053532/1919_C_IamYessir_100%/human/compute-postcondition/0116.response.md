Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is infinity.**

The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This means `y` is now explicitly set to infinity, while the values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
