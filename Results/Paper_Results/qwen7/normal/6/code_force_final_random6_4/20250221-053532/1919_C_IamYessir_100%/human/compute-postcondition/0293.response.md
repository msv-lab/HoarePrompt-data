Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list with at least one element and may have one more element added, `x` is either the last element of list `a` or `float('inf')`. If `b` is empty, `y` remains `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of list `b`.
