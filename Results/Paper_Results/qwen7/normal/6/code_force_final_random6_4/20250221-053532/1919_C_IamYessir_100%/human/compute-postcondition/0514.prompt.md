Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `n` will remain unchanged and still be greater than or equal to 1, `s` will be the count of elements in list `a` where each element is greater than the previous one. The state of `x` and `y` will remain unchanged, with `x` being the last element of list `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), and `y` being the last element of list `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `b` must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is 1, `x` is the last element of `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), `y` is the last element of `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty), and `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` if the condition is true, otherwise no change in the values of `s`, `x`, and `y` is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `b` must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is 2, `x` is the last element of `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), `y` is the last element of `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty). If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is set to 2. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `b` must have at least one element, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `s` is 3, `x` is the last element of `a` (or infinity if `a` is empty), `y` is the last element of `b` (or infinity if `b` is empty). If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is updated to 3. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
