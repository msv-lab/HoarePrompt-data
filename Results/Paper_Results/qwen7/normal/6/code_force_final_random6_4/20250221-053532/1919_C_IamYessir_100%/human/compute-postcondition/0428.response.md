Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, `y` is the last element of list `b`, `b` is a list containing elements from list `b` at index `i` (which is now 1), and the conditions involving `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain the same.**

Explanation: The code `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of list `b` to variable `y`. Since `i` is 1, `b` contains the element at index 1 of the original list `b`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
