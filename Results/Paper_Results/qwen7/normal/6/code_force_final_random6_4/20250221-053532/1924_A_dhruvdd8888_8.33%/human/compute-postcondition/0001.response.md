Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
