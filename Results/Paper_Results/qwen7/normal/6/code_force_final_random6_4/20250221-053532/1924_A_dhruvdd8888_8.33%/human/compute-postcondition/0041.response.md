Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the set `us`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `us`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet.
   - `i` is a character in the alphabet and `i` is not in the set `win`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `i` is a character in the alphabet and `i` is not in the set `win`, no change is made to `us`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since no changes are made to `us` within the loop body, `us` remains the same.
   - The variable `i` will be the next character in the set `us`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `us` remains a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet.
   - `i` will be the next character in the set `us`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `i` is the next character in the set `us`**.
