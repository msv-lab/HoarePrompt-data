Output State: **`win` is an empty set, `ps` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`.**

The code `win.clear()` clears the set `win`, making it an empty set. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
