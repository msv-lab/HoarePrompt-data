Postcondition: **`win` is a set containing the element `i`. If `len(win) == k`, then `ps` is 1. Otherwise, `ps` remains 0. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `k` is the integer value of the second input, `m` is the integer value of the third input, `s` is the string entered by the user, `us` is a set containing characters from 'a' to the k-th character in the alphabet, and `ans` is a list containing the element `i`. The first character of the string `s` is in the set `us`.**
