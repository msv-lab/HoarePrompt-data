Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 983, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^i - 1\) from its current value. Given that `i` is 10, \(2^{10} - 1 = 1023\). So, `x` is calculated as \(1022 - 1023 = -1\), but since the initial value of `x` is 1022, the new value of `x` is \(1022 - 1023 = -1 + 1022 = 983\). The values of `i` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged.
