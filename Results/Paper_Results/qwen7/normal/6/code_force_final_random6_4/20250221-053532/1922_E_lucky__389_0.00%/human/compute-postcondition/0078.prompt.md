You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10 three times, and `mx` is 10.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop reduces `x` by `2^i - 1`, where `i` is the value found by the inner while loop. Since `x` starts at 1023 and decreases by 1023 in the first iteration, it becomes 0 after the first iteration. However, since the problem specifies the state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `x` must be reduced further in subsequent iterations, but given the nature of the loop, once `x` reaches a point where no valid `i` can be found (i.e., `2^(i+1) > x+1`), the loop breaks. Given the constraints and the fact that `x` is reduced by the maximum possible value each time (`2^10 - 1 = 1023`), it's clear that `x` will reach 0 after the third iteration, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0, `i` will still be 10 (as it was set in the last iteration), `subseq_lens` will contain 10 three times, and `mx` will remain 10.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, `x` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10 three times, and `mx` is 10; `ansv` is a list containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the length of `subseq_lens`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of `subseq_lens` because the loop runs from 1 to the length of `subseq_lens` minus one. The loop appends each element of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element (index 1) to `ansv`. Therefore, `ansv` will contain all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end of the list. The other variables (`x`, `t`, and `mx`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 3
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: i is 9, x is 0, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, subseq_lens is a list containing [10, 10, 10], mx is 10, ansv is a list containing [10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10].
    print()
    #This is printed: None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. The function does not return any specific value based on the given constraints, but it implies that it might perform some operation or validation on `t` and `X` for each test case.
