Output State: `i` is 10, `x` must be at least 1023, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^{(i+1)} \leq x + 1\). Starting from `i = 0`, the loop increments `i` until the condition fails. Given that the loop executes 3 times when `x` is at least 7, we can deduce that the loop will continue to execute until \(2^{(i+1)} > x + 1\) when `x` is 1023. This means \(2^{11} = 2048\) must be greater than `x + 1`, so `x` must be less than 2047. Since the loop stops just before this condition is met, `x` must be 1023 or less but at least 1023 for the loop to execute 10 times. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 10, and `x` must be at least 1023.
