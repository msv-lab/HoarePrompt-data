Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `mx` is 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` must be at least 1
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 1, so `2 ** (i + 1)` becomes `2 ** (1 + 1) = 2 ** 2 = 4`.
   - Therefore, the condition simplifies to `4 <= x + 1`, which means `x + 1` must be at least 4, or `x` must be at least 3.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `x` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `x` meets this requirement.
   - No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the state at the end of the current iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 1, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
