Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 1022, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10, `mx` is 10**

Explanation: The code `mx = max(mx, i)` assigns the maximum value between `mx` (which is initially undefined) and `i` (which is 10) to `mx`. Since `mx` is initially undefined, it takes the value of `i`, which is 10. The values of `x`, `t`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged.
