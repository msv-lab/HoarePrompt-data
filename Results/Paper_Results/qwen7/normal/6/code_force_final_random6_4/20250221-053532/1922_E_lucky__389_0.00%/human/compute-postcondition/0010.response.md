Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` must be at least 3.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - Substitute `i = 2` into the loop condition: \(2^{(2 + 1)} \leq x + 1\).
   - This simplifies to \(2^3 \leq x + 1\), which further simplifies to \(8 \leq x + 1\).
   - Therefore, \(7 \leq x\).

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as \(7 \leq x\). Since `x` must be at least 3 and now we know it must be at least 7, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 7 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - No other variables in the loop head (`i` and the loop condition itself) need adjustment because they remain constant or do not affect the loop continuation directly.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `x` is at least 7 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state adjustments required are:

**State: `i` is 2, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 7, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**.
