### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`).
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be determined by the number of ways to choose elements from the array in increasing order.
   - The problem suggests using powers of 2 to construct the array, which corresponds to the binary representation of `X`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x`, which is `X - 1`.
   - It then constructs the list `subseq_lens` to represent the binary representation of `x + 1`.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
   - The list `ansv` is constructed based on the values in `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, the length of `ansv` and its elements are printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly converts `x + 1` to its binary representation and constructs the array based on this representation.
   - The array construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - The code handles the special case where `x` is 0 by breaking out of the loop.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2, resulting in an array of length 1 with a single element 0.
   - For larger `X`, the code correctly constructs the array using the binary representation.

5. **Validation:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
