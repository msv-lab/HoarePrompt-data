Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 1022, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `x`. It simply indicates that we would exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional structure. Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement is noted as exiting the most internal loop or if statement.
