Based on the initial state provided:

- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the number 10 three times, i.e., `[10, 10, 10]`.
- `i` is equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, so `i = 3`.
- `x` is 0.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (though its specific value is not relevant here).
- `mx` is 10.
- `ansv` is a list containing the elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the length of `subseq_lens`. Since `subseq_lens` has 3 elements, `ansv` will be `[10, 10, 10]`.

The loop iterates from 1 to the length of `subseq_lens` minus one (i.e., from 1 to 2), appending each element of `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to `ansv`. After the loop, `ansv` will indeed be `[10, 10, 10]`.

When the `print(len(ansv))` statement is executed, it will print the length of the list `ansv`.

Output: **3**
