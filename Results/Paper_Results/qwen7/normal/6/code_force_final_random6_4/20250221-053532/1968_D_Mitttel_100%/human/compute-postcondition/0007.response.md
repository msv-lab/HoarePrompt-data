Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]`, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, `cur` is `cur + a[s[0]]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `1` at index `s[0]` and all other elements are `0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur` by adding `a[s[0]]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its original value (which is 0) and the new value of `cur + k * a[s[0]]`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, and `vis`) retain their previous states.
