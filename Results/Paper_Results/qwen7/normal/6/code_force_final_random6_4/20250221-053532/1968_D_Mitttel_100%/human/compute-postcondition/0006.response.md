Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]`, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, `cur` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `1` at index `s[0]` and all other elements are `0`.**

Explanation: The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum between its current value (`0`) and the new value `cur + k * a[s[0]]`. Since `cur` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `mx = max(0, k * a[s[0]])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
