Output State: **`mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s[0]` must not be equal to `s`, `vis[s]` is 1.**

This means that the variable `mx` is updated to store the maximum value between its current value and the value of `cur + k * a[s]`. The conditions for `k`, `s[0]`, and `vis[s]` remain unchanged.
