### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, take turns moving through a permutation and accumulating scores based on the values at their current positions. The goal is to determine the winner after \( k \) turns.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the necessary inputs: \( n \), \( k \), \( p \), and \( a \).
   - It adjusts the indices of \( p \) and \( a \) to be zero-based.
   - It calls the function `func_1` for both players' starting positions.
   - It compares the results from `func_1` and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score a player can achieve starting from position \( s \) within \( k \) turns.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the game, updating the current score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) as it progresses.
   - The loop continues until \( k \) turns are completed or all positions are visited.
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the starting position \( s \).

4. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The code correctly handles the logic for calculating the maximum score for each player.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the player stays on the current position or moves to the next position in the permutation, updating the score accordingly.
   - The main loop in the given code correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game. The function `func_1` accurately calculates the maximum score for a given starting position, and the main part of the program correctly compares these scores to determine the winner.

### Correctness:
**True**
