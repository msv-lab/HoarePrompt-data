Postcondition: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and if `(a + b)` is even, `b` is updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
