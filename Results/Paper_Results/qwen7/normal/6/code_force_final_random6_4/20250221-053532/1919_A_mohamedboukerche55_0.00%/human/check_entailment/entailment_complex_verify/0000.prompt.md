You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the second integer from the last string input by the user converted to an integer, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and `b` is updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: 'bob  '
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: Postcondition: `a` is the second integer from the last string input by the user, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`, `s` is the last string input by the user, `i` is the total number of iterations (k + n), where `n` is the number of iterations minus 2, and the sum `(a + b)` is even if the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is met, otherwise `b` is not updated to the integer value of the second element in the list split by spaces from the last string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of integers from user input, specifically taking the second integer from each pair, and then checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob  '; otherwise, it prints 'alice'. The function does not return any value but modifies the variables `a` and `b` based on the last input pair.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even and prints the corresponding player as the winner. However, this logic is incorrect because the game involves strategic moves based on the current state of the wallets, not just the sum of the coins.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1`

According to the game rules:
1. Alice starts with `a = 1` and `b = 1`.
2. Alice can either swap wallets or not. If she does not swap, `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
3. Bob then has to make a move. If he swaps, `a = 1` and `b = 0`. If he does not swap, `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
4. Alice then makes another move, and since `a = 0`, she cannot make a valid move and loses.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "bob" for this case because `(1 + 1) % 2 == 0`.

Another example:
- Input: `1 4`

Following the game rules:
1. Alice starts with `a = 1` and `b = 4`.
2. Alice can swap wallets, making `a = 4` and `b = 1`.
3. Bob then removes a coin, making `a = 3` and `b = 0`.
4. Alice now has to swap wallets, making `a = 0` and `b = 3`.
5. Bob then removes a coin, making `a = 0` and `b = 2`.
6. Alice cannot make a valid move and loses.

Again, the program incorrectly outputs "bob" for this case.

These examples show that the program does not correctly simulate the game and thus is incorrect.
