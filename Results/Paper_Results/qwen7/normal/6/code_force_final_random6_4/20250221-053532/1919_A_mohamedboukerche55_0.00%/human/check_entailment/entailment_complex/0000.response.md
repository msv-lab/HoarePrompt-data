Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the pairs of integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. However, it incorrectly processes the input within the loop. Specifically, it only takes the second integer from the last input string, which is not required by the problem statement.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. According to the problem, the winner is determined by whether the sum of the initial number of coins in both wallets is even or odd. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This logic is correct but the way the input is processed is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Input Processing**: The program should process each test case individually, updating `a` and `b` for each test case. Instead, it only uses the values from the last input pair and ignores the rest.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the correct implementation should be as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected version processes each test case correctly, using the values of `a` and `b` from each input pair to determine the winner.

Correctness: **False**
