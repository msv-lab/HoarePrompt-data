Output State: The values of `a`, `b`, and `s` will be updated to the last set of values entered by the user before the loop terminates. Specifically, `a` will be the first integer from the final string input by the user, `b` will be the second integer from that same string, and `s` will hold that final string. Additionally, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, which is one more than the number of times the loop executed (i.e., if the loop ran 3 times, `i` would be 4).
