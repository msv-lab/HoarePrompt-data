The function reads multiple pairs of integers from user input, specifically taking the second integer from each pair, and then checks if the sum of these integers is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'bob  '; otherwise, it prints 'alice'. The function does not return any value but modifies the variables `a` and `b` based on the last input pair.
