Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array `a` is considered beautiful. Based on these inputs, the function returns information about the beautiful array `a` for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the given constraints and relationships.
