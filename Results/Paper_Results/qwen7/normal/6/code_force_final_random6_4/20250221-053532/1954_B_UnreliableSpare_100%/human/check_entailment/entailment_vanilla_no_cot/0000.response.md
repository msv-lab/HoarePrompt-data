Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Minimum Removals:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it prints `-1`. This part is correct.
   - However, the logic to find the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. It assumes that the array can only be made non-beautiful by removing elements that are not equal to the first element (`arr[0]`). This is not always true.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Uniform Arrays:**
   - The variable `cnt` is used to count consecutive elements that are equal to `val`, but it doesn't account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing other elements that are causing it to be "beautiful".

3. **Incorrect Minimization Logic:**
   - The `ans` variable is set to `Decimal('Infinity')` initially, but it should be initialized to a value that makes sense for the problem context. The logic to update `ans` with the minimum number of removals is also incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if the array is already uniform
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find the minimum number of removals
    min_removals = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if arr[i-1] == arr[i+1]:
            left = arr[:i]
            right = arr[i+1:]
            unique_left = len(set(left))
            unique_right = len(set(right))
            min_removals = min(min_removals, n - max(unique_left, unique_right))
    
    if min_removals == float('inf'):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(min_removals)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

This corrected version properly handles the logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.
