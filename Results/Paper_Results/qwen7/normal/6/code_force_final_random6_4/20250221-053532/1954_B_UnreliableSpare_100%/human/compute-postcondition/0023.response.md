Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1`, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must decrease to a value less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to a value that is less than `n` but still within the range of the loop.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `n` and `n` remains greater than 1.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Since the other variables (`flag`, `ans`, `val`, and `cnt`) are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1**
