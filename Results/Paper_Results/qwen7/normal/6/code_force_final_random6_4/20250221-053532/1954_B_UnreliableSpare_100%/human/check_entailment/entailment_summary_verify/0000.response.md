### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example provided.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
- A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) and replacing \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\).

#### Provided Program:
```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes an input array `a` of length `n` to determine if it is beautiful.
- If the array is not constant, it finds and prints the minimum consecutive segment length where the elements are the same.
- If the array is constant, it prints `-1`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Check for Uniformity:**
   - The program checks if the array is uniform (all elements are the same).
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1`. This part is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Finding Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where the elements are the same.
   - It uses a counter `cnt` to keep track of the length of such segments.
   - If the current element is different from the previous one, it updates the answer with the minimum of the current segment length and the previously recorded segment length.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum segment length found.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  1 2 1 2 1
  ```
  - The program correctly identifies that the array is not uniform.
  - It finds the minimum segment length of consecutive `1`s, which is `1`.
  - The output is `1`, which is correct.

- Consider another input:
  ```
  7
  3 3 3 5 3 3 3
  ```
  - The program correctly identifies that the array is not uniform.
  - It finds the minimum segment length of consecutive `3`s, which is `3`.
  - The output is `3`, which is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It handles both uniform and non-uniform arrays appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
