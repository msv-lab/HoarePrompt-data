Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. The annotated program has several issues:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly identify if the array is beautiful or not.
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.
   - The final output is incorrect for some cases.

3. Specifically:
   - The initial check for whether the array is beautiful is incorrect. It only checks if the array is constant (all elements are the same).
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is based on counting consecutive segments of the same value, but it does not account for the requirement to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The final output is always 0, which is incorrect for most cases.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
