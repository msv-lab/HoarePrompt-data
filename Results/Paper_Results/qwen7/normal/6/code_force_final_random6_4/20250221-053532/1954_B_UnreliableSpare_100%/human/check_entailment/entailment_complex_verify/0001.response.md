### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If yes, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it counts the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The function `func_1()` checks if the array is uniform using a flag.
   - If the array is uniform, it directly prints `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, it iterates through the array to count the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic to count the minimum removals needed. The current implementation only counts the length of consecutive segments where elements are the same but does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements strategically.

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code shows that after checking if the array is uniform, the function proceeds to count the minimum number of removals needed.
   - The variable `cnt` is used to count consecutive elements that are the same, and `ans` is updated with the minimum value of `cnt`.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of removals is found. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The current logic would count the segment lengths and print `1`, which is incorrect because removing the middle `2` would break the beauty condition.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The code correctly identifies uniform arrays and prints `-1`.
   - However, the logic to find the minimum removals is flawed. The current approach does not ensure that the minimum number of removals is found to break the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The current logic to count the minimum removals is flawed and does not guarantee the correct result.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
