Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `val`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, `i` is still less than `n`, `n` is still greater than 1, `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`, and the value of `arr[i]` remains equal to `val`.
