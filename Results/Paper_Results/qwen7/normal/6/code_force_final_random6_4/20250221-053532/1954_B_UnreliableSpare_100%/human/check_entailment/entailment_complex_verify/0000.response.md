### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and verify the original assessment.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Flag Initialization:**
   - A boolean flag `flag` is initialized to `True`. This flag is used to determine if the array is constant (all elements are the same).

3. **Checking if Array is Constant:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any two adjacent elements are different. If it finds such a pair, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Finding Minimum Segment Length:**
   - If the array is not constant (`flag` is `False`), the program initializes `ans` to infinity.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum segment length where the elements are the same.
   - If it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum segment length found so far and resets the counter `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - If the array is constant (`flag` is `True`), it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length found.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before entering `func_1()`, `t` is read and the loop runs `t` times.
  - Inside `func_1()`, `n` is read, and the array `arr` is constructed.
  - The flag `flag` is set to `True`.
  - The loop checks if any two adjacent elements are different. If found, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
  - After the loop, `ans` is set to infinity.
  - The program then iterates through the array to find the minimum segment length where elements are the same.
  - Finally, it prints `-1` if the array is constant or the minimum segment length otherwise.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Case 1: Constant Array**
  - If the array is constant, the program correctly prints `-1`.
  - Example: `1 1 1 1` → Output: `-1`

- **Case 2: Non-Constant Array**
  - If the array is not constant, the program correctly identifies and counts the minimum segment length where elements are the same.
  - Example: `1 2 1 2 1` → Output: `1` (Removing the element at index 2 makes the array non-beautiful)

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases like arrays with only one element or arrays with alternating elements correctly.
  - Example: `1` → Output: `-1`
  - Example: `1 2 3 4` → Output: `-1`

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The original assessment was incorrect because the program does handle the scenarios where the array is not constant and correctly identifies the minimum segment length.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
