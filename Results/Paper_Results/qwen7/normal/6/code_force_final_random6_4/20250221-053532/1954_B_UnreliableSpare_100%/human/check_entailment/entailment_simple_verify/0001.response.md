### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If yes, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it counts the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The function `func_1()` checks if the array is uniform using a flag.
   - If the array is uniform, it directly prints `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, it iterates through the array to count the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the uniform array correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, the logic to count the minimum removals has some issues. Specifically, the variable `cnt` is reset to 0 whenever a different element is encountered, which means it only counts the length of consecutive segments of the same element. This approach does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements in a way that disrupts the pattern without necessarily removing the maximum number of elements.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The code correctly identifies uniform arrays and prints `-1`.
   - The logic to find the minimum removals is flawed. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The current logic would count the minimum removals as 1 (by removing one '1' or one '2'), but the correct answer should be 1 (by removing the middle '2'). The logic does not account for the optimal way to break the beauty condition.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotation states that `ans` will hold the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, but this does not guarantee the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition. The annotation also mentions that `cnt` is reset to 0, which means it only considers the length of consecutive segments and not the optimal way to break the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The logic to count the minimum removals is flawed and does not account for the optimal way to break the beauty condition.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
