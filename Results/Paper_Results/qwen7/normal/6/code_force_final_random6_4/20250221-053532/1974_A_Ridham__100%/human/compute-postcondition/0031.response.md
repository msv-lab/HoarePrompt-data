Output State: **`remaining_cells` must be greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` retains its initial value, `total_space` retains its initial value, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` (an input integer) to `space_x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
