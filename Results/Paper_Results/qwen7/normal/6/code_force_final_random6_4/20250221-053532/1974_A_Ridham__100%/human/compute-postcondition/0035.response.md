Output State: **`remaining_cells` must be greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`**.

This means that the variable `screen_require_for_y` has been calculated as `y // 2 + 1`, while all other variables retain their initial values from the preconditions.
