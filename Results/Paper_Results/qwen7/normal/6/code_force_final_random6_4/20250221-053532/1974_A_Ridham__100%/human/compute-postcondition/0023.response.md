Output State: **`remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even, or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15`, and `extra_space` is divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The code calculates `extra_screen` by dividing `extra_space` by 15 using integer division (`//`). Since `extra_space` is already divisible by 15, `extra_screen` will be an integer representing how many 15-unit spaces fit into `extra_space`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
