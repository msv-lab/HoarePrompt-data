Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`**.

This means that the variable `space_y` has been assigned the value of `y * 4`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
