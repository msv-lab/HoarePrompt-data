Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `space_x - remaining_cells` to the variable `extra_space`. Since `space_x` is equal to `x` and `remaining_cells` is unchanged, `extra_space` is calculated based on these values. The other variables retain their initial values as no operations were performed on them.
