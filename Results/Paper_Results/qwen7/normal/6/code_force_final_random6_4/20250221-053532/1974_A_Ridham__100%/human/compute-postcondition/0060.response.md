Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4 * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` is a list with one additional element `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input, `y` is updated to the second integer from the input, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 * 4 + x * 1`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15`; otherwise, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

In this output state, the `result` list has been updated with one more element, which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their initial values or the values they had before the code was executed, except for `x` and `y`, which have been updated to the first and second integers from the input respectively.
