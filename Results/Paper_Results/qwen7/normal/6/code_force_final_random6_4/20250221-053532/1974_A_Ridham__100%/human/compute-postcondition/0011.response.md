Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is not an even number, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1**.

The code calculates `screen_require_for_y` which is `y // 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
