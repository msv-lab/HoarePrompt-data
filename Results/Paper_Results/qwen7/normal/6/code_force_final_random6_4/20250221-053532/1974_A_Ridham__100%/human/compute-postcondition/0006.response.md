Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`**.

In this output state, the variable `total_space` has been calculated as the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or values from the initial state.
