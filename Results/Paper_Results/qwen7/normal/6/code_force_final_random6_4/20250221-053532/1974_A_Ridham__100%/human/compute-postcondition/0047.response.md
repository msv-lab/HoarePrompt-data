Output State: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * (`y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1) - `space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input, `y` is updated to the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial values of `remaining_cells`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except for `x` and `y`, which are now updated to the values provided by the user.
