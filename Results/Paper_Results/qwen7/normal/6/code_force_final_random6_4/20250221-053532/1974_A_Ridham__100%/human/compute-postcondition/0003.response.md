Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial state.
