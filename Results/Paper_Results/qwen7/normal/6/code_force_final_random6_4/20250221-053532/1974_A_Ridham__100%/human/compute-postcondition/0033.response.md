Output State: **`remaining_cells` must be greater than 0, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `total_space` is updated to be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. Since `space_y` is equal to `y * 4` and `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` becomes `x + y * 4`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
