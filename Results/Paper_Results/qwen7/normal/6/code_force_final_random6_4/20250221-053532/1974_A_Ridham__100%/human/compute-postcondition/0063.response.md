Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the input integer provided at the start. After all iterations, the `result` list will contain `n` elements. Each element in the `result` list will be determined based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration.

For each iteration `_` in the range of `n`:
- `x` and `y` are read from input.
- `space_x` is set to `x`.
- `space_y` is set to `4 * y`.
- `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the `result` list appends `screen_require_for_y`.
- Otherwise, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise. The `result` list then appends `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.

The final `result` list will contain `n` elements, each representing the outcome of the conditions checked during each iteration of the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged from their initial values, while `result` will be populated with the outcomes of the loop's logic for each iteration.
