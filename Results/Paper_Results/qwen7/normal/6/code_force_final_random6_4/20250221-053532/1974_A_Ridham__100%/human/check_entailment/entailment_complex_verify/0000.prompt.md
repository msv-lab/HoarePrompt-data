You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the input integer provided at the start. After all iterations, `result` will be a list containing the number of elements that satisfy the conditions specified within the loop. Each element in the list represents the value of `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions met during each iteration.
    #
    #- `remaining_cells` will be recalculated for each iteration based on the current values of `y` and `space_y`.
    #- `space_x` will remain constant as it is initialized to `x * 1` and does not change throughout the loop.
    #- `space_y` will be updated to `y * 4` for each new iteration.
    #- `total_space` will be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`.
    #- `t` and `n` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    #- `x` and `y` will be updated with new input values for each iteration.
    #- `screen_require_for_y` will be either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` based on whether `y` is even or odd.
    #- `extra_space` will be `space_x - remaining_cells`.
    #- `extra_screen` will be calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise.
    #
    #The final `result` list will contain the outcomes of each iteration, either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, depending on the conditions evaluated in the loop.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: the outcome of each iteration (either screen_require_for_y or extra_screen + screen_require_for_y) on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and pairs of integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it calculates the number of elements required based on specific conditions involving `x` and `y`. If certain conditions are met, it appends either `y // 2` or `extra_screen + y // 2` to a list. Finally, it prints each element in the list on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Specifically, the logic for calculating `remaining_cells` and how it affects the total number of screens is flawed. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate this:

Consider the input `(x, y) = (11, 3)`:
- The program calculates `space_x = 11 * 1 = 11` and `space_y = 3 * 4 = 12`.
- It then calculates `screen_require_for_y = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
- The remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons are `15 * 2 - 12 = 18`.
- Since `11 > 18`, the program incorrectly calculates `extra_screen = 11 // 15 + 1 = 1`, leading to a total of `2 + 1 = 3` screens, which is incorrect.

The correct approach would involve more detailed calculations to ensure that the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons is optimized across the minimum number of screens. The current implementation does not handle all edge cases correctly.
