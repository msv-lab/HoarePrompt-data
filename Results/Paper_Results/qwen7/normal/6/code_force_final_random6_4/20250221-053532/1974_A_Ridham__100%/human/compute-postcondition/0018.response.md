Postcondition: `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even, or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, and `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.
