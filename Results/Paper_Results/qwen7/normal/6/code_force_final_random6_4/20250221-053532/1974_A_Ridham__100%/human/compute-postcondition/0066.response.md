Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each `t`, it processes pairs of integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function does not return a specific value but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.**
