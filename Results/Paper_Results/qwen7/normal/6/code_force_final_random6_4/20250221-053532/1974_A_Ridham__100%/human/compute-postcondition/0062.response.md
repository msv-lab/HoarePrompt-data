Postcondition: **`remaining_cells`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, `y`, `screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space`, and `extra_screen` retain their initial values except that `result` is a list with one additional element. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` has one more element which is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` has one more element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, or `extra_space // 15` otherwise.**
