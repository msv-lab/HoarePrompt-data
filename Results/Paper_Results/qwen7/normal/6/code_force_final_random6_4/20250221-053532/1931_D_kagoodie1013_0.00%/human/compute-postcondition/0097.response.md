Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of `count` values from all iterations of the loop. For each iteration, `count` is calculated as the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` for every `num` in `arr`. After all iterations, `mod_x_map` will contain the frequency of each `mod_x_key` (i.e., `num % x`) across all arrays processed, and `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each `mod_y_key` (i.e., `num % y`) across all arrays processed. `num`, `mod_x_key`, and `mod_y_key` will be undefined because they are local to each iteration of the loop. `count` will be the final accumulated value of counts from all iterations.

In summary, `results` will be a list of integers where each integer represents the count value calculated in each iteration of the loop, and `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will reflect the overall frequencies of remainders when all numbers in `arr` from all test cases are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
