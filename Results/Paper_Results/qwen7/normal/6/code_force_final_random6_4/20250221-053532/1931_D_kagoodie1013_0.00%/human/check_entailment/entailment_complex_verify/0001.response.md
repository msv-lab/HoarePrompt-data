### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Reading Input:
- The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
- It then iterates through the input to extract the necessary parameters for each test case.
- This part is correct and handles the input reading and splitting properly.

#### Test Case Processing:
- For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
- It uses a function `func_1` to process each test case and calculate the number of beautiful pairs.
- This part is also correct and handles the extraction and processing of each test case.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Initialization:**
  - It initializes `results` to store the final output.
  - It initializes `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the frequencies of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`.

- **Iterating Through Array:**
  - For each element in the array, it calculates the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` correctly.
  - It uses these remainders to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.
  - Specifically, it checks if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
  - The logic for counting pairs is correct:
    - `mod_x = -num % x` ensures that the remainder is non-negative.
    - `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` correctly adds the counts from the maps.
    - The updates to the maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) are also correct.

- **Final Output:**
  - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the count to the `results` list.
  - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the count values for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the entire input and splits it into parts for each test case.
   - The extraction of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` is done correctly.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the necessary variables.
   - It iterates through each element in the array and calculates the required remainders.
   - It uses these remainders to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` ensures that the remainder is non-negative.
     - `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` correctly adds the counts from the maps.
     - The updates to the maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) are also correct.

### Conclusion:

After re-analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for finding beautiful pairs is correct. The program correctly processes each test case and computes the number of beautiful pairs as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
