Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads and parses the input, splitting it into individual test cases with their respective sizes, values of \(x\) and \(y\), and the array elements.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the program initializes a count variable to zero and creates two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to store the frequency of remainders when the array elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.

3. **Loop Through Array**: The program iterates through each element of the array, calculates its remainder when divided by \(x\) and \(y\), and updates the count based on the frequency of these remainders in the maps. This ensures that for each element, the program checks how many previous elements form a "beautiful" pair with it according to the given conditions.

4. **Result Calculation**: The count is incremented by the number of times the current element's remainder modulo \(x\) appears in `mod_x_map` and the current element's remainder modulo \(y\) appears in `mod_y_map`. This effectively counts the number of pairs that satisfy both conditions.

5. **Output**: The program appends the final count for each test case to the results list and returns this list at the end.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It correctly processes each test case, calculates the number of beautiful pairs, and returns the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
