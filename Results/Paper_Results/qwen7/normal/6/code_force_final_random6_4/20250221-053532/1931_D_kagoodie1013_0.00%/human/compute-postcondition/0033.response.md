Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n`: This is the first element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x`: This is the second element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y`: This is the third element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr`: This is the fourth element of the tuple in `test_cases`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `test_cases`. Since `arr` is an empty list at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the current tuple from `test_cases` is being processed.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `arr`: After processing the current tuple from `test_cases`, `arr` will contain the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the next element from `test_cases` if it exists.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y`: These will be the values of the next tuple from `test_cases`.

Given that `arr` is currently an empty list, the next tuple from `test_cases` will be assigned to `arr`, and the first three elements of this tuple will be assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`arr` is the next tuple from `test_cases`, `num` is not defined, `mod_y_key` is not defined, `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` values accumulated over all iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`.**
