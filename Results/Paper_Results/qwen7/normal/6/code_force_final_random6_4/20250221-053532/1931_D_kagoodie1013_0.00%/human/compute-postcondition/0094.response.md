Output State: All elements in `arr` have been processed, `count` is the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each `mod_x_key` (i.e., `num % x`), `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each `mod_y_key` (i.e., `num % y`), and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.

This means that after the loop has executed for all iterations, `count` will hold the total sum of occurrences where the modulus of `num` with `x` and `y` can be found in the respective maps. The maps `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will contain the counts of each possible remainder when dividing the numbers in `arr` by `x` and `y`, respectively.
