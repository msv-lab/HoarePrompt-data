### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It iterates through the input to extract the necessary parameters for each test case.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to process each test case and calculate the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It initializes counters and dictionaries to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the remainder when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It uses these remainders to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the entire input and splits it into parts for each test case.
   - The extraction of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` is done correctly.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the necessary variables.
   - It iterates through each element in the array and calculates the required remainders.
   - It uses these remainders to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.
   - The logic for counting pairs is correct:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` ensures that the remainder is non-negative.
     - `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` correctly adds the counts from the maps.
     - The updates to the maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) are also correct.

### Key Points from Annotations:
- The program correctly handles the reading and processing of multiple test cases.
- The use of modulo operations to find remainders is correct.
- The counting mechanism using dictionaries is appropriate and correctly implemented.
- The final count is accumulated correctly for each test case.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for finding beautiful pairs is correct. The program correctly processes each test case and computes the number of beautiful pairs as specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. The use of modulo operations and dictionaries to count the pairs is sound and correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
