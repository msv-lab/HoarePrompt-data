Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `mod_y_key` is not defined, `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` values accumulated over all iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. Since `results` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new list initialized here. The other variables (`arr`, `num`, `mod_y_key`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The `count` remains the same as it was calculated during the iterations of the loop.
