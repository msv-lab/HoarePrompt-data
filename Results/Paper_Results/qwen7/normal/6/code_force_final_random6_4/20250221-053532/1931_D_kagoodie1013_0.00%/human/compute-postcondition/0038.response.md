Output State: **`count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is `-num % x`. Here, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `x` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state. However, since `x` is used in the modulo operation, `mod_x` will be the result of `-num % x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
