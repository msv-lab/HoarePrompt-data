Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is an empty list, `num` is not defined, `mod_y_key` is not defined, `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` values accumulated over all iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % x` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique value of `num % y` and the value is the count of how many times that remainder appeared, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map` values plus all `mod_y_map` values, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder when elements of `arr` are divided by `y` and each value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing one more element than before, which is the current value of `count`; `count` is the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`; `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each `mod_x_key` (i.e., `num % x`), `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each `mod_y_key` (i.e., `num % y`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
