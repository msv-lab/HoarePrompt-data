Output State: `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map.get(-num % x, 0)` + `mod_y_map.get(num % y, 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder of `num % x` and the value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary where each key is a remainder of `num % y` and the value is the count of occurrences of that remainder, `results` is [0].

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `count` will hold the total sum of all occurrences of `mod_x` and `mod_y` values across the array `arr`. The dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will contain the counts of each unique remainder when each element of `arr` is divided by `x` and `y` respectively. The variable `num` will be the last element processed in the array, and `mod_x_key` and `mod_y_key` will be the remainders of the last element when divided by `x` and `y` respectively.
