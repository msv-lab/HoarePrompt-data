You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` containing `n-1` integers (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 and each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` where each element is derived based on the previous elements and the corresponding elements in `arr`. Specifically, it starts by setting `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`, then iteratively computes each subsequent element in `ans` by adding the current element in `arr` to the previous element in `ans`, and adjusting the value if necessary to ensure it is greater than the corresponding element in `arr`. Finally, it returns the last element of `ans`, which is the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  4
  2 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  An array `a` such that:
  - `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2`
  - `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4`
  - `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1`

- **Actual Output:**
  The program generates:
  ```
  3 5 4 9
  ```

  Let's verify if this output satisfies the conditions:
  - `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 5 \bmod 3 = 2` (Correct)
  - `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \bmod 5 = 4` (Incorrect, should be 4 \bmod 5 = 4, but the condition is satisfied)
  - `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 9 \bmod 4 = 1` (Correct)

While the last two conditions are satisfied, the second condition is not strictly following the modulo operation as required. A more appropriate approach would be to ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true for all `2 \le i \le n`.

A correct solution would involve choosing `a_i` such that `a_i = x_i + k * a_{i-1}` for some integer `k`, ensuring the modulo condition is met. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
