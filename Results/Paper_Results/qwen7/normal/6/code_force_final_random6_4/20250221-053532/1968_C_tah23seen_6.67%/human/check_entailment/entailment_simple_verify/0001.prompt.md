You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n. The variable n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.

    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be -1, and `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` will be the final value of `ans` which is the maximum possible value that can be achieved by doubling the values according to the given conditions.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`, which is `ans[length_of_arr - 2] + arr[length_of_arr - 1]`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \leq i \leq n`. Given the constraints and examples, we need to ensure that our solution respects these conditions.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr` of `n-1` integers.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to compute the array `ans`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes the array `ans` with zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1` to ensure it's greater than `x_2`.
   - For each subsequent element, `ans[i+1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`, ensuring that `ans[i+1] > arr[i+1]` and thus satisfying the modulo condition.
   - If `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it is greater than `arr[i+1]`.
   - Finally, `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that `ans[i]` is always greater than `arr[i]`, which guarantees that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.
   - The increment loop ensures that `ans[i+1]` is at least `arr[i+1] + 1`, which is sufficient to satisfy the modulo condition.
   - The final assignment for `ans[-1]` ensures the last element also satisfies the condition.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required logic to generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
