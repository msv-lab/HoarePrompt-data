Output State: `i` is -1; `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. After each iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be the sum of `ans[i]` and `ans[i + 1]`. This process continues until `i` becomes -1 (since `i` starts at `length_of_arr - 2` and decrements by 1 each time the loop runs), meaning the loop has processed all elements in `arr` from the end to the beginning. By the end of the loop, `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` will hold the sum of all elements in `arr`.
