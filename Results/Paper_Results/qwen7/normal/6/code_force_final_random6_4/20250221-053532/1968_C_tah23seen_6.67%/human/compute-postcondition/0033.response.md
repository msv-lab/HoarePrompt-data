Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`; `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be `ans[i]` which is `ans[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]` since `i` is 1) by adding the value of `ans[i]` (which is `ans[1]`). Given that `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`, and `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[2]`, the updated value of `ans[2]` remains the same as `ans[1]` because the operation does not change its value.
