Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and should start from 0 to `n-3` (since the loop runs `n-2` times).
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations and should be within the range `2 ≤ n ≤ 500`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - The value of `n` must be within the specified range, so we need to ensure `n` is at least 2.

4. **Consider the Given Information**:
   - `arr` is a list of `n-1` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` elements, each initialized to 0.
   - `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.

Since these pieces of information (`arr` and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization of `i` and `n`, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
