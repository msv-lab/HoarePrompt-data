Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`.
   - `ans[2]` is less than or equal to `arr[2]`.
   - `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1] + ans[0]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]`) must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, in the next iteration, `i` will become 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is 2.
   - The condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` needs to be satisfied for the next iteration, so `ans[3]` (the next element in the `ans` array) must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` must be 2.
   - `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `ans[3]` is less than or equal to `arr[3]`**
