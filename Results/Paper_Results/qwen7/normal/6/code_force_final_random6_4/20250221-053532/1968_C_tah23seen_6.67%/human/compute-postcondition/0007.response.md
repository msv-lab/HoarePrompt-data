Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans`[1] is `arr`[0] + `ans`[0], `ans`[2] is less than `arr`[2], `ans`[2] is now `ans`[1] + `ans`[0]**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]` since `i` is 1) by adding `ans[i]` (which is `ans[1]`) to it. Given that `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]` and `ans[2]` was previously less than `arr[2]`, now `ans[2]` becomes `ans[1] + ans[0]`, which is `(arr[0] + ans[0]) + ans[0]` or `arr[0] + 2 * ans[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
