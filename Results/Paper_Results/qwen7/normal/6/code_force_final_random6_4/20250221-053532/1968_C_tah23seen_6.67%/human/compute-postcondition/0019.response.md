Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:`. The only variable involved here is `ans[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is `length_of_arr - 2`.
   - `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous value of `ans[i + 1]`.

4. **Check the Current Value of `ans[i + 1]`**:
   - Given `i = length_of_arr - 2`, then `i + 1 = length_of_arr - 1`.
   - Therefore, `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`.

5. **Condition for the First Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` is the current state, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the condition `ans[length_of_arr - 1] <= arr[length_of_arr - 1]` holds true.

Given the above steps, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is length_of_arr - 2; `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to arr[i + 1]**
