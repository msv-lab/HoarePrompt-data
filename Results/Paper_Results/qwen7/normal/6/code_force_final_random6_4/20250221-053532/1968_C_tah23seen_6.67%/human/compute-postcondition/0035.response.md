Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `ans[3]` is `ans[2] + ans[2]; arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]`) by adding `ans[i]` (which is `ans[1]`). Given the initial state, `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`, and `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `arr[2]` is greater than or equal to `ans[2]`. So, `ans[3]` is calculated as `ans[2] + ans[2]`, which is `2 * ans[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
