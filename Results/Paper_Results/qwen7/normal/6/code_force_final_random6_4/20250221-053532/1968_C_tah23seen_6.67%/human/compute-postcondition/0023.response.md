Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is `length_of_arr - 2`
  - `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`
- The `while` loop condition:
  - `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:`

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `length_of_arr - 2`
   - `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`
3. **Next Iteration Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[i + 1]` must still be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

### Determining the Next State
- Since `i` is `length_of_arr - 2`, the next value of `i` would be `length_of_arr - 1`.
- To ensure the loop can execute again, `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`) must be less than or equal to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` to ensure it meets the loop condition for the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `length_of_arr - 2`, `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, and `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`**
