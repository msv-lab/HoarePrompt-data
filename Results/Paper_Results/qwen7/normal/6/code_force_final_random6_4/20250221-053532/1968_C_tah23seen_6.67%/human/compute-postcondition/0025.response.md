Output State: The final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be the sum of all elements in the array `arr` starting from index `i` to the end, and `i` will be -1 (since the loop decrements `i` until it reaches -1).

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. With each iteration, `ans[i + 1]` is updated by adding the current value of `ans[i]` to it. This process continues until `i` becomes -1, at which point the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is no longer true because `i + 1` would refer to an invalid index. By the end of the loop, `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` will hold the sum of all elements in `arr` from `arr[length_of_arr - 1]` to `arr[0]`, and `i` will have been decremented to -1.
