Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the range of the loop based on the variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `n` to `2 * n`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` should be within this range.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the sixth element from `res`.
   - `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`.
   - `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `ul` equals `ur`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.
   - The loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is defined outside the loop and does not change within the loop.

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - The fifth element from `res` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes the seventh element from `res` (since `i` was the sixth element and it increments by 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is the seventh element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`**.
