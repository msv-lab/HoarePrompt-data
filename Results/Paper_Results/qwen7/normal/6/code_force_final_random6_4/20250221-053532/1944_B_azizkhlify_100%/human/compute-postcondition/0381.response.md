Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be less than `2 * n`, which means `n` can take any positive integer value since `n < 2 * n` is always true for any positive integer `n`.
   - `ul` is equal to `ur`, but this does not affect the print statement directly.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`.

The print statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter. Therefore, it will print the same value twice.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of `i` and `a`.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where [a[i]] is the element at index i in the list a, and i = n + 1)**
