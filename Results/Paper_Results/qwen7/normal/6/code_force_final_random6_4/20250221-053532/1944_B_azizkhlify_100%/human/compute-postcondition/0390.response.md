Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` must be less than `2 * n`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

First, let's analyze the value of `i`:
- Since `i` is defined as `n + 2`, `i` is `n + 2`.

Next, let's consider the value of `a[i]`:
- The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the index `i = n + 2`.
- However, the problem does not provide any explicit values for the elements of the list `a` or any additional context about the list.

Given the constraints:
- `n` must be less than `2 * n`, which is always true for any positive integer `n`.

Since the exact values of the elements in the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`. Therefore, the output will be in terms of the value of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2]**
