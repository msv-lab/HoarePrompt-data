Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0, but the value of `n` is not specified.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is a list, and `i` is used as an index to access an element in the list `a`. Since `i` is 1, the statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a`, repeated twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

However, the value of `a` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] a[1]**
