Output State: **`i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for every `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1**.

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `2 * n - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed each index from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. The list `r` will have been modified such that the element at the index `a[i] - 1` will have its value incremented by 1 for every iteration of the loop. All other variables (`l`, `a`, `n`, and `r`) will retain their values from the final iteration of the loop, with no further changes.
