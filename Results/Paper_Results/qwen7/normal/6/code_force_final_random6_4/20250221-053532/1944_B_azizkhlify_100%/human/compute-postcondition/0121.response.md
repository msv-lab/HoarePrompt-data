Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`. This means `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same as before.
- `x` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at the index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` has been incremented by 1, `a[i]` now refers to the element at the new index `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **[value of a[i]] [value of a[i]]**
