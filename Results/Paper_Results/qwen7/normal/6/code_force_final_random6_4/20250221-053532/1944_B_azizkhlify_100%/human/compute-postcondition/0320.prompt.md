Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for every `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, and `n` is at least 1; `ul` is equal to `k * 2` if the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, otherwise the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2` + 2 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged. If the condition `ul == k * 2` is true, `i` is set to 1, `n` is at least 1, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2` + 2 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is false, `i`, `n`, and `ul` retain their original values as specified in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2` + 4 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
