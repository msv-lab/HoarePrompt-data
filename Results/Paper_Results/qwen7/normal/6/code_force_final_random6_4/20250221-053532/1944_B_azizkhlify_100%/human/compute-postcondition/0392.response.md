Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`, `ur` is increased by 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, making it `ur + 2`. All other variables retain their original conditions or values. Specifically, `i` remains `n + 2`, `n` must still be less than `2 * n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is still set to 0.
