Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is at least 1.
- The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

We need to determine the value of `a[i]`. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, it means that `a[i] - 1` is the index in the list `l` where the value is 2. Therefore, `a[i]` must be `3` because `a[i] - 1 = 2`.

Given this, the print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **3 3**
