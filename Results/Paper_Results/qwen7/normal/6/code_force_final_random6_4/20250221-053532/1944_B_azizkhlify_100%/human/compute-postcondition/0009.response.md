Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0 (it remains unchanged).

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The state of `l[a[0] - 1]` being incremented by 1 does not change within the loop head itself, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.
