Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be less than `2 * n`
   - If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then the condition holds true and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`
   - This means `i` starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `n + 2`.
   - The condition `n < 2 * n` still holds because `n` is unchanged and must remain less than `2 * n`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same (less than `2 * n`).
   - The condition regarding `ul` and `ur` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`**
