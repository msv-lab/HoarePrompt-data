Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` must be less than `2 * n`
- The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i = n`
- Therefore, `a[i] = a[n]`

However, the exact value of `a[n]` is not specified. We only know that `r[a[i] - 1] = r[a[n] - 1] = 2`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the value of `a[n]` twice, separated by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
