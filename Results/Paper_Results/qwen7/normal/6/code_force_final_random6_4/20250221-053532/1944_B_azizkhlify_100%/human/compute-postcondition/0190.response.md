Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and `k` is truthy, meaning `k` is a non-zero value.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, where `a[i]` refers to the element in the list `a` at index `i`.

Given `i` is 0, `a[i]` is the same as `a[0]`. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, it means `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 1.

Therefore, the print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index 0 of the list `a`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[0]**
