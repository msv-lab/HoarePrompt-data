Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is at least 1.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` determines the number of iterations, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - Variables like `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` are not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization of `i`. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it should start from 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
