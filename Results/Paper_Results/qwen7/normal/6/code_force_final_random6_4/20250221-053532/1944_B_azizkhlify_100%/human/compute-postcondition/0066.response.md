Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `re` is incremented by 1 to equal `k`, `ul` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`, and `k` is non-zero. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was checking the condition for breaking. The values of `i`, `re`, `ul`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
