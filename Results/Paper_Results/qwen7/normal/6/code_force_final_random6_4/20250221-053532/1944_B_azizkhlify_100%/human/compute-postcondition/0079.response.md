Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `re` is `k + 1`
- `ul` is a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`
- `k` is non-zero
- `res` is a list with the element `a[i]` appended

The print statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

Given that `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. Since no specific value for `a` is provided, we can only refer to it as `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0]**
