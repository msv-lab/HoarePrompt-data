Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 2 * n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n` and increments `i` until `i < 2 * n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 again, but since `i` is now `n + 1`, this state will be updated accordingly.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
