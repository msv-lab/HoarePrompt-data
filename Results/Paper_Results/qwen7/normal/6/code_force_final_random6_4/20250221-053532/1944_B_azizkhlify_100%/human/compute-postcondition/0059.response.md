Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `2 * n`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `ul` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`, with `k` being a non-zero integer.
- The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `2 * n`, so `a[i]` refers to the element in the list `a` at index `2 * n`.
- The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, which means that the element `a[i] - 1` exists in the list `l` and its value is `1`.

However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided directly. Since `a[i]` is an index into the list `a`, and we only know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, we can infer that `a[i]` must be `2` because `a[i] - 1` would then be `1`, and `l[1]` is `1`.

Therefore, the value of `a[i]` is `2`.

Output: **2**
