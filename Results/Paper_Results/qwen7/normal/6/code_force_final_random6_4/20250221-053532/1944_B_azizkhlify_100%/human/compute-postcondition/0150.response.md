Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[n, 2 * n)`.
- Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

### Adjusting States:
- **Variable `i`**: It needs to be set to `n + 2`.
- **Variable `n`**: No change needed as it remains the same.
- **Array `r`**: The element `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Since `i` is now `n + 2`, we need to determine the value of `a[i]` for the next iteration. However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided, but we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` must still be greater than 0
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration (where `i = n + 2`)

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1**
