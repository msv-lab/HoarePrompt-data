Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `l` is a list.
   - `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be `n + 1`) must be less than `2 * n`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be `n + 1`.
- `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
- `a` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 when `i` is `n + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer, `l` is a list, `a` is a list such that `a[n-1]` is a valid index within the list `l`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
