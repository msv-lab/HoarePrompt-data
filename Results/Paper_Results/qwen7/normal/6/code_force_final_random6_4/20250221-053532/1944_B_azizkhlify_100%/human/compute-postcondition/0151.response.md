Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially `n + 2` and `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `a[i]` is `a[n + 2]`. Therefore, `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
