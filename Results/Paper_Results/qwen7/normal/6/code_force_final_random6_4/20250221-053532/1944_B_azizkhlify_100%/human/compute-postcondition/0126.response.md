Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and `ur` is increased by 2.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the only changes are the ones mentioned in the postcondition, which are not altered by the `break` statement itself. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the postcondition.
