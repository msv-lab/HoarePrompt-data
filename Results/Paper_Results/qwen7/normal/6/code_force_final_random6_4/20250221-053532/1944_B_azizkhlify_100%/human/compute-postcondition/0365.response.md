Output State: **The loop will print all elements in the list `res` separated by a space.**

Explanation: Given the provided loop and its behavior, once the loop completes all its iterations, it will have printed each element in the list `res` exactly once, with each element separated by a space. Since the loop continues to iterate as long as there are elements in `res`, and it prints each element on a single line without any additional characters between them, the final output will be a sequence of all elements in `res` listed in the order they were added, separated by spaces.
