The function processes a string `s` containing '+' and '-' characters. It counts the number of '-' characters in the string and calculates a result based on the length of the string and the count of '-' characters. Specifically, it returns the length of the string minus twice the count of '-' characters, unless the count of '-' characters equals the length of the string, in which case it returns the length of the string.
