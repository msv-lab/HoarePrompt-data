Reasoning:
1. The problem requires splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
2. The penalty calculation is based on the sum of elements in each subarray and its length.
3. The provided solution counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and calculates a result based on the length of the string and the count of '-' characters.
4. The formula used in the solution, `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`, is intended to minimize the penalty:
   - If the count of '-' characters (`neg`) is less than half the length of the string (`n`), the penalty is minimized by having more positive elements.
   - If the count of '-' characters is exactly half the length of the string, the penalty is simply the length of the string.
5. However, the solution does not actually perform the optimal splitting of the array `a` into subarrays. Instead, it provides a simplified formula based on the count of '-' characters and the length of the string.

Given the problem's requirements, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. The solution only considers a simplified case without performing the necessary array splitting and penalty calculation.

Correctness: **False**
