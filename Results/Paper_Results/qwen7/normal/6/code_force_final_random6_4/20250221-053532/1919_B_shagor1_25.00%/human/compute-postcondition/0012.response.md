Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `neg` is 1 if the character `s[i]` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0.
