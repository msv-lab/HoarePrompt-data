You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` containing '+' and '-' characters. It counts the number of '-' characters in the string and calculates a result based on the length of the string and the count of '-' characters. Specifically, it returns the length of the string minus twice the count of '-' characters, unless the count of '-' characters equals the length of the string, in which case it returns the length of the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the given program step-by-step.
2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
3. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
4. It then counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
5. Based on the value of `n` and `neg`, it calculates and prints the result using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

Now, let's verify if this logic matches the problem statement:

- The problem requires us to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
- The penalty for a single array `c` of length `m` is calculated as `|c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m| * m`.
- The optimal strategy to minimize the penalty is to split the array `a` into segments where the sum of elements is zero whenever possible, because the penalty for such a segment would be zero.

Given the string `s`, the array `a` will consist of `1`s and `-1`s. If the number of `1`s equals the number of `-1`s, the sum of the entire array is zero, and the optimal solution would be to split the array into individual elements, resulting in a total penalty of `n`.

If the number of `1`s does not equal the number of `-1`s, the optimal solution involves splitting the array into segments where the sum is as close to zero as possible, which can be achieved by counting the number of `-1`s (or `neg`). Each `-1` contributes `-1` to the sum, and each `1` contributes `1`. Thus, the total penalty can be minimized by considering the imbalance between the number of `1`s and `-1`s.

The formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly calculates the minimum penalty:
- If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the penalty is `n - 2 * neg`, which accounts for the imbalance.
- If `n` is equal to `neg`, the penalty is `n`, which means the array cannot be split further without increasing the penalty.

Thus, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty.
