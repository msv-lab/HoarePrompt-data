Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`, `neg` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `neg` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 5000, and `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
