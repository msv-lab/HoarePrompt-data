Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `neg` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `neg += 1` increments the value of `neg` by 1. Initially, `neg` is 1 if the character `s[i]` is '-', otherwise it is 0. After executing `neg += 1`, `neg` will be 2 if `s[i]` was '-', and 1 if `s[i]` was not '-'. However, since the exact value of `s[i]` is not specified, we keep `neg` as 1, assuming the worst-case scenario where `s[i]` was not '-' initially. All other variables remain unchanged.
