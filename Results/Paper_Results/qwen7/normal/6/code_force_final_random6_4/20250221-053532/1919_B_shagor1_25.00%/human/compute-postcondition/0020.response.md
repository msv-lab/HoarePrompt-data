Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000), and a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`. For each test case, it processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the count of '+' and '-' characters.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific values for `t`, `n`, and a string `s`. It processes the string `s` to count the occurrences of '+' and '-' characters and returns a result based on this count.
