Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`. `s` is updated to the input string from user.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The length of `s` is now equal to `n`, and `s` consists of '+' and '-' characters as per the initial state.
