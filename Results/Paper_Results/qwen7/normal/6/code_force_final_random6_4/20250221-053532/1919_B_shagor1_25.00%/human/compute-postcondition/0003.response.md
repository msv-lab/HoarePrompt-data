Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. This means the loop variable `i` will iterate over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character.

3. **Current state**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
   - `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`
   - `neg` is 0

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the string `s` having at least one character, we need to ensure that `s` is non-empty. Additionally, since `s` is a string of length `n`, and `n` is given as an integer between 1 and 5000, we can confirm that `s` will indeed have at least one character.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the string `s` to ensure it is non-empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, `neg` is 0**
