Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n` that must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `neg` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `neg += 1` increments the value of `neg` by 1. Since `neg` was initially 1 (if the character `s[i]` was '-' and `neg` remained 0, or was already 0), it now becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
