### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

2. **String to Array Conversion**: The string `s` is converted to an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is `|sum(subarray)| * len(subarray)`. To minimize the penalty, ideally, we want to balance the positive and negative elements in each subarray.

4. **Optimal Strategy**: If the number of `-` characters (`neg`) is less than or equal to half the length of the string `n`, the optimal strategy is to have one subarray containing all elements. This is because having more subarrays would increase the penalty due to the multiplication by the length of each subarray.

5. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters (`neg`).
   - The expression `print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)` is used to determine the minimum penalty:
     - If `n != neg`, the penalty is `n - 2 * neg`. This accounts for the fact that each `-1` contributes negatively to the sum, and we want to minimize the impact of these `-1`s.
     - If `n == neg`, the penalty is `n`, meaning the array is perfectly balanced, and no further splitting is needed.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n == neg`, the penalty is simply `n`, which is correct since the array is perfectly balanced.
   - When `n != neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` ensures that the penalty is minimized by reducing the contribution of `-1`s.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case based on the provided problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
