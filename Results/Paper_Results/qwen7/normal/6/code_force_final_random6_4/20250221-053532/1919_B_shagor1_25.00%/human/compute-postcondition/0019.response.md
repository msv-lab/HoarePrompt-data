Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `n`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `neg` is the total count of '-' characters in the string `s`.

The expression to be evaluated in the `print` statement is `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.

Let's break down the expression:

1. `neg` is the total count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
2. `n` is the length of the string `s`.
3. The expression checks if `n` is not equal to `neg`.

The output depends on the relationship between `n` and `neg`:

- If `n != neg`, then the expression evaluates to `n - 2 * neg`.
- If `n == neg`, then the expression evaluates to `n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `neg` are not specified, we need to consider both cases:

- If `n != neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
- If `n == neg`, the output will be `n`.

Therefore, the precise output cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `neg`. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the given conditions.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the count of '-' characters in the string s)**
