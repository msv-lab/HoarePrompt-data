Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns information based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and provides some form of output based on the given data, though the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.
