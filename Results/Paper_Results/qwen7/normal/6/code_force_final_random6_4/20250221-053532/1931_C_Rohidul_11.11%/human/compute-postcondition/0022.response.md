Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `end` is increased by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is equal to `r - 2`.
   - `r` must be greater than `l`.
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]` if `l` is 2, and so on until `l` equals `r - 2`.
   - `a[r - 1]` must be equal to `a[r - 2]`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `r` and `l`, and also on the equality of elements in the list `a`.
   - Since `l` is defined as `r - 2`, if `r` decreases, `l` will also decrease accordingly.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be satisfied.

Given the current state:
- `r` must be greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `r` must be greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Since `l` is derived from `r` (`l = r - 2`), if `r` is decreased by 1, then `l` will become `r - 3`, which still satisfies `r > l` (as long as `r` is greater than 2).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure:
- `r` is greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.

So, the state adjustments required are:
- `r` must be greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

State: **`end` is increased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` must be greater than `l` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`**
