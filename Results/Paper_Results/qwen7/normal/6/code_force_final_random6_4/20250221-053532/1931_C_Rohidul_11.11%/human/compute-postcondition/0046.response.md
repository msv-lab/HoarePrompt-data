Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`. The relevant variables here are `l`, `r`, and `a`.

2. **Analyze the conditions**:
   - `l < r`: This condition checks if the left index (`l`) is less than the right index (`r`).
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This condition checks if the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1` in the list `a`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `end` is increased by 6.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `st` is 0.
   - `end` is 0.

4. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `l < r` will be true as long as `n > 1`.
   - The condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` requires that the first two elements in the list `a` are equal.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure `l < r`.
   - The first two elements in the list `a` must be equal for the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to be true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and the first two elements of the list `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`end` is increased by 6, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer and the first two elements in the list `a` must be equal**.
