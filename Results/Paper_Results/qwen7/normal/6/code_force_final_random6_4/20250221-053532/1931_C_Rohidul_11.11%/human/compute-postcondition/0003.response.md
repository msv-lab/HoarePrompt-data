Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value `0`, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
