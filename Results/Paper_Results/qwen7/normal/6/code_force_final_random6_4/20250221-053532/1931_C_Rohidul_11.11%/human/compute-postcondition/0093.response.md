Output State: **`l` is increased by 3, `r` must be greater than `l + 2`.**

Explanation: Initially, `l` was increased by 2, making it `l + 2`. The code then increments `l` by 1, so `l` is now `l + 3`. The condition that `r` must be greater than `l + 2` remains unchanged, so `r` must still be greater than `l + 2`, which is now `l + 3`.
