Output State: **`l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-3`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-3`, `end` is increased by 1, and `end` is equal to `end + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `l` is still increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2` (now `r-3`), `r` is now `r - 1`, `a[r]` is still equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is still equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2` (now `r-3`), and `end` is increased by 1.
