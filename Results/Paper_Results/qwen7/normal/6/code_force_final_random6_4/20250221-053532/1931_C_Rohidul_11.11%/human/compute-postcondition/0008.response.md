Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to adjust the states of `l`, `r`, and `a` such that the loop condition is satisfied for the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `n` is an input integer (this is not part of the loop head and doesn't need adjustment).
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `l` is 1.
- `r` must be greater than 0.
- `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.
- `st` is 1.
- `end` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `l < r`: Since `l` is currently 1, `r` must be greater than 1.
- `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: Since `l` is 1, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`.

To satisfy these conditions, we need to ensure that `r` is greater than 1 and `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `r` must be greater than 1.
- `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`.

So, the final state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 1, `r` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0**
