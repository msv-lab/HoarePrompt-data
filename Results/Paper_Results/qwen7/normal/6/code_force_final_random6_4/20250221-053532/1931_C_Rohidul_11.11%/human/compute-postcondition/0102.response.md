Output State: **`l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `r` is now equal to `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `end` is increased by 1, and `end` is equal to `end + 1`.**

This means that the value of `end` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
