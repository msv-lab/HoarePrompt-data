Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed and does not account for all necessary operations to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.

Here's why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The code only checks if the first and last elements are different and tries to handle those cases separately. However, it doesn't consider other possible sequences where multiple segments might need to be changed to a common value.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation part `ans = r - l` and `ans = r - l - 1` is overly simplistic and does not reflect the actual minimum cost required to make all elements equal.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle cases where there are multiple segments that need to be changed to a common value. For instance, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` should be handled by changing the middle segment to a common value, but the current logic does not capture this.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
- Identify all distinct segments in the array.
- Calculate the cost of making each segment equal to the smallest element in that segment.
- Sum up the costs to get the minimum cost.

A more appropriate approach would involve using a dynamic programming or greedy algorithm to find the optimal segments to change.
