Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `r - 1` or a value greater than 0 but still less than or equal to `n - 3`
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true
   - `end` is 2

3. **Determine Which Variables Can Be Adjusted**: The loop head variables are `r` and `l`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `r - 1` or a value greater than 0 but still less than or equal to `n - 3`.
   - Since `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, this part of the condition is already satisfied.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - To satisfy `r > l`, `r` must be greater than `l`. Since `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` should not be equal to `r - 1` because that would violate the condition `r > l`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `r` is greater than 0 and still satisfies `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0 and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 2**
