Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `end` is increased by 3.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is equal to `r - 3`, where `r` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
   - Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(max(0, ans))
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the value of `ans`:

- `r` is the last index of the list `a`, so `r = len(a) - 1`.
- `l` is `r - 3`, so `l = (len(a) - 1) - 3 = len(a) - 4`.
- The condition for `ans` depends on whether `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`:
  - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans = r - l - 1 = (len(a) - 1) - (len(a) - 4) - 1 = 2`.
  - If `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` is 0, then `ans = len(a) - 1`.

Since the value of `st` is not specified, we need to consider both cases:

- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans = 2`.
- If `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` is 0, then `ans = len(a) - 1`.

In either case, `max(0, ans)` will ensure that the result is at least 0. Therefore, the possible values for `max(0, ans)` are 2 or `len(a) - 1` (which is at least 1 since `len(a) >= 4`).

Given that the minimum value of `ans` is 2 (when `a[0] == a[-1]`), the output will be:

Output: **2**
