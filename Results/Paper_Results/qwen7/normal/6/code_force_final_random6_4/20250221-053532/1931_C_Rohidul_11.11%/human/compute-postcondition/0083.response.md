Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is False, `end` is `n - 1, ans` is determined based on the conditions above.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the existing list `a`. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `end`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
