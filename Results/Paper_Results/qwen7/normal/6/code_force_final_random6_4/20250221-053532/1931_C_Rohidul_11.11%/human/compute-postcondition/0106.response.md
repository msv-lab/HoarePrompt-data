Output State: **`l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` is increased by 3 and now equals `end + 3`**.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `l` will be increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4` (since it increments by 1 each iteration), `r` will be `r - 1` (reduced by 1 each iteration), `a[r]` will be equal to `a[r - 1]` (because the loop condition checks if `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`), `st` will be equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4` (as it also increments by 1 each iteration), and `end` will be increased by 3 (since the loop executed 3 times and `end` is incremented by 1 each iteration).
