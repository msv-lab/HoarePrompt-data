Postcondition: `l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` equals `end + 3`, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`. The condition `st == 0` and `end == 0` and `a[0] != a[-1]` holds true.
