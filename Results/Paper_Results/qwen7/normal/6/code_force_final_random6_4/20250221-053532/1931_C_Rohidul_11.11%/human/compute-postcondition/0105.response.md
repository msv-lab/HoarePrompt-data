Output State: **`l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-3`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-3`, `end` is increased by 1 and now equals `end + 1`.**

In this case, the code simply increments the value of `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states as described.
