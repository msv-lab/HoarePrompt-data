Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-1`, `r` remains unchanged, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-1`.

To explain this in simpler terms: The loop continues as long as there are still consecutive identical elements in the list starting from index `l`. Each time the loop runs, it increments `l` and `st` by 1, effectively skipping over these consecutive elements. The loop stops when `l` reaches a point where the elements are no longer identical or when `l` is no longer less than `r`. Therefore, `st` will be the count of all consecutive identical elements from the start of the list up to but not including `r`, and `l` will be the position right after the last set of consecutive identical elements.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `r` is equal to `r - 1`, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `r` is now equal to `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-2`, `end` is increased by 1, and `end` is equal to `end + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is increased by the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-3`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-3`, `end` is increased by 1 and now equals `end + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
