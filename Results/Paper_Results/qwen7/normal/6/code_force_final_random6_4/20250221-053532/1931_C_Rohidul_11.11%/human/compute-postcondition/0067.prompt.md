Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `end` is increased by 7 for each iteration until the condition `l < r` is no longer true, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with the condition that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list is reached, `l` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `r` is `n - 1`, and `st` is the total count of iterations the loop executed.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `end` will have been increased by 7 for each time the loop ran, starting from 0. The loop continues to run as long as there are consecutive equal elements in the list `a` from index `l` to `r`. Each iteration increments `l` by 1 and increases `st` (the count of iterations) by 1. The final value of `st` will be the number of times the loop executed, which is determined by how many pairs of consecutive equal elements were found in the list `a` before the condition `l < r` was no longer satisfied.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with the condition that consecutive elements in the list are equal until the end of the list is reached, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `r - 1` or a value greater than 0 but still less than or equal to `n - 3`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1 and must still be greater than 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
