Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `r` must be greater than 1.
   - `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.
   - `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`.
   - `st` is 2.
   - `end` is 0.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves two variables: `l` and `r`.
   - `l` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `r`, and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `l` is 2, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]` for the loop to continue.
   - `r` must be greater than `l`, which is 2. Therefore, `r` must be greater than 2.
   - `l` must remain 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` must remain 2.
   - `r` must be greater than 2.
   - `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`.
   - `st` remains 2.
   - `end` remains 0.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables is:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 2, `r` must be greater than 2, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 2, `end` is 0**
