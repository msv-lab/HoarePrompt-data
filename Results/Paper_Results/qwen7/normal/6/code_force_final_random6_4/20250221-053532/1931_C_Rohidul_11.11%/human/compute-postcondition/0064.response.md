Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1 and must still be greater than 0, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1. Since `r` was initially greater than 0 and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` was true, decrementing `r` by 1 maintains the condition that `r` is still greater than 0 and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` remains true. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
