Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, otherwise unchanged; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This means that:
- `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.
- If `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is now decreased by 1.
- If `E[out_aa]` was not greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
- `E[out_aa]` is always decreased by 1.
