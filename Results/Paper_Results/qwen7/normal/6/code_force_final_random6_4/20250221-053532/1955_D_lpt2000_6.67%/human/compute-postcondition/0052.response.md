Postcondition: **`tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains 0; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m+1` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - (m + 1)`; if `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, it is decreased by 1, otherwise `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, it is decreased by 1, otherwise `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0.**
