Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D.values()`, `C[in_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` are not greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is further increased by 1, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `fnd` is incremented by 1 only if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`. The other conditions and values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
