You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers \(t\), \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\), along with two lists \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates the number of times the sum of the intersection of the first \(m\) elements of list \(a\) and list \(b\) is greater than or equal to \(k\) after iterating through the remaining elements of list \(a\). The function returns the total count of such occurrences across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of good subsegments of array `a` based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes counters for the first segment of length `m` from array `a` and array `b`.
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if the initial segment of `a` matches the criteria to be good.
3. **Sliding Window**: It uses a sliding window approach to check subsequent segments of `a` of length `m`. For each new element entering the window and the element leaving the window, it updates the counters accordingly.
4. **Condition Check**: It continuously checks if the current segment meets the condition of having at least `k` matching elements with array `b`.

Given the sliding window technique and the use of counters, the program efficiently handles the problem constraints and should work correctly for all valid inputs within the specified limits. There doesn't seem to be any obvious edge cases or logical flaws that would cause the program to fail under the described conditions.
