Postcondition: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` and either `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]` (if the if condition is true) or `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` (if the if condition is false). `tot` is the sum of the values of `D`; `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element; `aa[m:]` must have at least one element; `E[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0; `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if the if condition is true; `in_aa` and `out_aa` are updated to the next pair of elements from `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`.
