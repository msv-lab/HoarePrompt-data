Postcondition: **`tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m+2` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - (m + 2)`. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. `D[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0.**
