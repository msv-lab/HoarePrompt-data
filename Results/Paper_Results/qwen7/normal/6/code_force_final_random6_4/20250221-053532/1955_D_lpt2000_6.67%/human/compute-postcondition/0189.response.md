Output State: **`E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` is either decremented by 1 or remains greater than 0, if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is now `E[out_aa] - 1`; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= -1`, then `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to -1, and `E[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` retain their original values. Additionally, `C[in_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.**

This means that `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]` remain unchanged from the initial state, except that `E[in_aa]` is now one more than its previous value.
