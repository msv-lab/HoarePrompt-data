Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4; `i` is 4; `p[4]` is `ind`**

The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the index `i` in the list `p`. Given that `i` is 4, the value of `p[4]` is now `ind`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 4 remains unchanged, and the value of `i` remains 4.
