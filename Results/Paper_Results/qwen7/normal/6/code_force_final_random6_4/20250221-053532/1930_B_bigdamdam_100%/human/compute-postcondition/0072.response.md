Output State: **`ind` is 1 + n % 2, `i` is n-1, `p` is filled from index 0 to n-1 with values from `ind` down to `ind - 2*(n//2)`, and `ind` is reduced to `ind - 2*n//2`.**

Explanation:
1. The first line sets `ind` to `1 + n % 2`. This means `ind` will be 1 if `n` is odd, and 2 if `n` is even.
2. The loop does not actually run because there is no loop in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `i` and `p` remain as described in the initial state.
3. After the line `ind = ind - 2 * (n // 2)`, `ind` is updated to `ind - 2*n//2`.

Since the loop is not present, the values of `i` and `p` remain as they were initially described.
