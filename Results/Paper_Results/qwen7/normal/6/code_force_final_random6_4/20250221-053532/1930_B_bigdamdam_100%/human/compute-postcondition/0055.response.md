Based on the initial state and the loop described, let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ind` is 9.
   - `i` is 7.
   - `p[1]` is 1.
   - `p[3]` is 3.
   - `p[5]` is 5.
   - `p[7]` is 7.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value greater than or equal to `n` (which is not explicitly given but can be inferred from the context).
   - For each iteration, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `ind`, and then `ind` is incremented by 2.

Given the current values:
- When `i` is 1, `p[1]` is already 1, so no change.
- When `i` is 3, `p[3]` is already 3, so no change.
- When `i` is 5, `p[5]` is already 5, so no change.
- When `i` is 7, `p[7]` is already 7, so no change.

Since `i` is currently 7 and the loop will stop after this iteration (as `i` will next be 9, which is not within the range specified by the loop), the loop does not execute any further assignments.

Therefore, the final state of the `p` array remains:
- `p[1]` is 1.
- `p[3]` is 3.
- `p[5]` is 5.
- `p[7]` is 7.

The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the `p` array separated by spaces.

Output: **1 3 5 7**
