Output State: **`ind` is the first integer from the input split into a list, `i` is 8, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7, `n` is the first integer from the input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code `ind = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ind`. Since `n` is the first integer from the input split into a list, `ind` now holds that value. The other variables (`i`, `p`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
