Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ind` is `ind - 4`, `p[2]` is `ind - 4`**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decreases the value of `ind` by 2. Since `ind` was initially `ind - 2`, subtracting 2 from it results in `ind` becoming `ind - 4`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `p[2]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
