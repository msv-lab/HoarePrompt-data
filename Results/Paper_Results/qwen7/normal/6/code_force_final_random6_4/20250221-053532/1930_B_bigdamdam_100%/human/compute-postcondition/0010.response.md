Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(0, n, 2)` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ind` is `ind - 4`.
   - `p[2]` is `ind - 4`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1` with a step of 2. Therefore, the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 each time it runs.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `2 + 2 = 4`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now 4, the loop will continue if `n > 4`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

7. **Consider other variables**:
   - `ind` and `p[2]` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone. However, they might change within the loop body, but since no loop body is provided, we assume they remain unchanged for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**
