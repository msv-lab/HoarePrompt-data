Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variables that are directly controlled by the loop. In this case, the loop head involves `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n` and `i` increments by 2 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ind` is `ind - 2` (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution).

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `0 + 2 = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

6. **Final state**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ind` remains unchanged from the previous state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ind` is `ind - 2***.
