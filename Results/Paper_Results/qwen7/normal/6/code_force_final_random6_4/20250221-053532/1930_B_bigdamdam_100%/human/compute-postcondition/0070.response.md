Output State: `p` is a list where every element at even indices (starting from 0) is filled with decreasing values of `ind` starting from its initial value down to `ind - 2*(n//2)`, and all odd indices remain zero. The length of `p` is `n`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `p` will have its even-indexed positions filled with decreasing values starting from the initial value of `ind` and decreasing by 2 for each subsequent even index until the end of the list is reached. Odd-indexed positions in the list `p` will remain as zero. The number of elements filled in `p` will be equal to the length of `n`, and the process stops when there are no more even indices left within the bounds of the list.
