Output State: **`ind` is 7, `i` is 3 + n % 2, `p` is filled from index 0 to n-1 with values from 3 down to 3 - 2 * (n // 2), and p[1 + n % 2 + 2] is 3, and p[i] is 5.**

Explanation: The variable `ind` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 5 to 7. The values of `i`, `p`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the operation `ind += 2`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ind` and retains the original values of `i`, `p`, and `n`.
