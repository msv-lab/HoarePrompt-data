Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `ind + 4`, `i` is equal to `ind + 8`, `ind` is equal to `ind + 6`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `p[i]` is equal to `ind + 4`, `i` is equal to `ind + 8`, and `ind` is equal to `ind + 4`.
- After executing `ind += 2`, the value of `ind` is updated to its current value plus 2, which means `ind` is now equal to `ind + 4 + 2` or `ind + 6`. The values of `p[i]` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not directly modified by the code.
