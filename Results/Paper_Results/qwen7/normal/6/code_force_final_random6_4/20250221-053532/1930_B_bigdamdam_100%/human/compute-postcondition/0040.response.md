Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `n+2`, `ind` is `ind-4`, `p[i]` is `ind-4`**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decrements the value of `ind` by 2. Initially, `ind` was equal to `ind-2`. After decrementing by 2, `ind` becomes `ind-4`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `p[i]` remain unchanged.
