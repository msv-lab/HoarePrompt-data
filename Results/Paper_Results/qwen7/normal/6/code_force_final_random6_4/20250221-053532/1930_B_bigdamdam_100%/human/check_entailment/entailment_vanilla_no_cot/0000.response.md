Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a permutation that satisfies the given condition. Let's break down why:

1. **Odd and Even Indices Handling**: The code attempts to fill the permutation with odd and even indices separately, starting from the largest available numbers. This approach does not guarantee that no pair of elements \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) will satisfy the divisibility condition.

2. **Divisibility Condition**: The problem requires that for any two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \), \( p_i \) should not divide \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) should not divide \( p_{j+1} \). The current logic does not ensure this condition is met for all possible pairs.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the input `n = 4`. The generated permutation using the provided code might look like `[4, 1, 2, 3]` or similar patterns. However, as noted in the problem statement, this is not always valid. For instance, in `[4, 1, 2, 3]`, we have \( p_1 = 4 \) which divides \( p_3 = 2 \), violating the condition.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve generating a permutation where the relative positions of numbers prevent any two elements from satisfying the divisibility condition. One possible strategy is to alternate between high and low values in a way that avoids direct divisibility.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that should work:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(range(1, n + 1))
        # Shuffle the list to avoid simple patterns
        import random
        random.shuffle(p)
        # Ensure the permutation satisfies the condition
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if p[i] % p[i + 1] == 0 or p[i + 1] % p[i] == 0:
                # If a pair violates the condition, swap to fix
                while p[i] % p[i + 1] == 0 or p[i + 1] % p[i] == 0:
                    p[i], p[i + 1] = p[i + 1], p[i]
        print(*p)
```

This approach shuffles the list and then checks and adjusts the permutation to ensure no two consecutive elements violate the divisibility condition.
