Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` retains its original value from the input.
