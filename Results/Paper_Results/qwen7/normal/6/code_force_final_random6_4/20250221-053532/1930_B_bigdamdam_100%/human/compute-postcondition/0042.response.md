Output State: **`ind` is 1 if `n` is odd, `1` if `n` is even; `i` is `n`, `p` is filled from index 0 to `n-1` with values starting from `n` and decreasing by 2 for each subsequent index.**

Explanation:
- The line `ind = 1 + n % 2` calculates the value of `ind` based on whether `n` is even or odd.
  - If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `ind` becomes `1 + 0`, which is `1`.
  - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `ind` becomes `1 + 1`, which is `2`.
- The initial state of `i` and the list `p` remains unchanged.
