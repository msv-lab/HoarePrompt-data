Output State: **`p[i+2]` is `ind - 4`, `i` is `i + 4`, `n` is greater than `i + 4`, `ind` is `ind - 2`, and `p[i]` is `ind`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ind` to `p[i]`. Given the initial conditions, `p[i+2]` was previously `ind - 4`, `i` was `i + 4`, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`, and `ind` was `ind - 2`. After executing the code, `p[i]` now holds the value of `ind`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
