Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `c` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input from the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `maxi`, `c`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
