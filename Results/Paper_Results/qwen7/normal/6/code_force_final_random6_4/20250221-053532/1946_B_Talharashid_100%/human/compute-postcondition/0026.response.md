Output State: **`l` must have at least two integer elements, `ele` is the next integer in `l`, `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now holds the value of its previous value plus `ele`. The condition that `l` must have at least two integer elements and that `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi` remains valid.
