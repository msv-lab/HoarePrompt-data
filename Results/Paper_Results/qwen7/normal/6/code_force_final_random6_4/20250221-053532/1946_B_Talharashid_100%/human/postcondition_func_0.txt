The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and an array \( a \) of integers. For each test case, it calculates a value \( c \) based on the elements of array \( a \) under certain conditions and keeps track of the maximum value of \( c \) across all test cases. Finally, it prints the result of the formula \( (2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i) \mod 1000000007 \), where \( \text{maxi} \) is the maximum value of \( c \) found during the processing of all test cases.
