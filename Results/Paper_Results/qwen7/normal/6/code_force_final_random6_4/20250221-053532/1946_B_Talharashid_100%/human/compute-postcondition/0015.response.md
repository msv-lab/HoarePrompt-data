Postcondition: `l` must have at least one integer element. If there exists an integer `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and the value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `ele` is a non-negative integer, `c` is now `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and the previous value of `maxi`.
