Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will hold the maximum sum of contiguous subarrays within the list `l` where the subarray starts from an element less than 0 and ends just before the next negative element or the end of the list. `maxi` will store the highest value found among these sums. The variable `i`, which was used as an index in the initial state but is not referenced in the loop, remains unchanged. The variable `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` retain their initial values from the precondition.

In simpler terms, `c` accumulates the sum of numbers until it encounters a negative number (or reaches the end of the list), and `maxi` keeps track of the highest sum encountered during the entire process.
