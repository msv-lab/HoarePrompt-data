Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `idx - 1`, `cnt` is `v[0] + v[2]`, and `ans` is increased by either `cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2` if `v[2] < 3`, or `v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6` if `v[2] >= 3`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `cnt` is updated to `v[0] + v[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
