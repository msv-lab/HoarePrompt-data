Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its previous value. The conditions on `n` and `v[i]` remain unchanged.
