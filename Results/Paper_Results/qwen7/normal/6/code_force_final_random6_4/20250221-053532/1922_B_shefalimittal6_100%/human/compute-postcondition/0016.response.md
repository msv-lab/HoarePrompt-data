Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is now the integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `x = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value from the list `data` at the index `idx` to the variable `x`. The value of `idx` is increased by 1, and the value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `n` and `v[x]` remain unchanged.
