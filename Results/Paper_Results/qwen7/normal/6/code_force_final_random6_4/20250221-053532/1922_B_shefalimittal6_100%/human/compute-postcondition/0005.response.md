Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string read from stdin, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `idx` is 2, `a` remains unchanged as a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
