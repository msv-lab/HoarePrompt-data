Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, but since it's a placeholder and not used in the loop, we don't need to consider it for adjustment.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. This means that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the condition for the loop to execute is met. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0.

4. **Other States**: The other states (`data`, `n`, `idx`, `a`, and `results`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
