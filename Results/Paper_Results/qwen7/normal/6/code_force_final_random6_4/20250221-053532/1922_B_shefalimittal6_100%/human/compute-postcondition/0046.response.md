Output State: **`i` is updated to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and `cnt` is updated to the next value of `v[i]`**.

This means that the variable `i` has been updated to 2, `ans` has been updated according to the given formula involving `cnt`, `v[1]`, and `v[i]`, and `cnt` has been updated to the next value of `v[i]`. The other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
