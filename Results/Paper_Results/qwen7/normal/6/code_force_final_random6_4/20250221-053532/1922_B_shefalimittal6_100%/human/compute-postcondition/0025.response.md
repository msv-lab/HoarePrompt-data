Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is increased by `n`, `x` is the integer from `data[idx]` for each iteration, `v[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data` up to the `n`-th element.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. No changes are made to `n`, `idx`, `x`, or `v` in this line. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as per the initial state, with `n` being a positive integer, `idx` being increased by `n` after each iteration, `x` being the integer from `data[idx]` for each iteration, and `v[x]` being incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data` up to the `n`-th element.
