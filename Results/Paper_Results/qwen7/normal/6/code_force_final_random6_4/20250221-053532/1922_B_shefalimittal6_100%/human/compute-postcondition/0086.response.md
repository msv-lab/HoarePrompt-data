Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` if the value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3; `ans` is also increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value. The conditions for updating `ans` based on `cnt` and `v[i]` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and the conditions for updating `ans` based on `cnt` and `v[i]` are still valid.
