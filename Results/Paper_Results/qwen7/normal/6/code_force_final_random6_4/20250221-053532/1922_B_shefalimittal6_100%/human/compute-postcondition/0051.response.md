Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, if `v[i] >= 2`. Otherwise, `i` remains 3 and `ans` does not change.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Given that `i` is 3, this expression becomes `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6`. Since the initial postcondition states that if `v[3] >= 2`, `ans` is increased by this value, and otherwise, `ans` does not change, the updated state depends on the value of `v[3]`. However, since the exact value of `v[3]` is not provided, we keep the condition in the output state. `i` remains unchanged at 3.
