Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `idx` will be equal to `n`, `v[x]` will contain the count of each digit from `data` that was processed, and `x` will be the last digit processed; `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `idx`, `v[x]`, `x`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were after the loop, with `ans` being set to 0.
