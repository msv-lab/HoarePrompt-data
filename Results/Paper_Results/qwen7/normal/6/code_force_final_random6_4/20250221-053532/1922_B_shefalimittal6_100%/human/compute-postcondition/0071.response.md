Output State: **`idx` must be less than `n`, `v[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[idx])`**

Explanation: The code `x = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `x`. This means that `x` now holds the value of the element at index `idx` in the list `data`, converted to an integer. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
