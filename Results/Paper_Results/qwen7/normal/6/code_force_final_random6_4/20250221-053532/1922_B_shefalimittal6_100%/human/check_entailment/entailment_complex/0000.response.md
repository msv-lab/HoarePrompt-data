Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input according to the problem statement.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and processes each test case as required.
3. The logic for counting the number of ways to form a triangle is correct:
   - It uses the fact that for three numbers \(a, b, c\) to form a triangle, they must satisfy \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\). Given the nature of the problem (powers of 2), the condition simplifies to ensuring that no single stick is longer than the sum of the other two.
4. The calculation of the number of valid triplets is done correctly by iterating through the frequency array `v` and applying combinatorial formulas to count valid combinations.
5. The output is generated correctly by storing the results in a list and printing them at the end.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
