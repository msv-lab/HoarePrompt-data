Output State: The `results` list will contain the string representation of `ans` for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `t` times, and `t` is the value of `data[0]`, the `results` list will have exactly `t` elements, each being the string representation of the final `ans` value calculated for that particular iteration. The variable `cnt` will be updated to reflect the total count of occurrences across all iterations, and `ans` will hold the cumulative result of all iterations. The variable `i` will be `n` after the last iteration, and `n` will be the value of `data[idx - 1]`.
