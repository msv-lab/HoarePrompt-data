Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is increased by 1**

The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. However, the initial values or specific values of `v` and `x` are not provided, so we can only say that `v[x]` is increased by 1. The conditions and changes to other variables remain as stated in the initial state.
