Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `t` (the total number of iterations) and the loop counter, which is an underscore `_` (which is typically used when the loop variable is not needed).

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` contains a single string which is the str representation of `ans`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `ans` is the cumulative sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each `i` from `0` to `n`.
   - `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` up to the `n`-th element.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is an underscore, it is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head. However, the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `results` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operation is specified that would change `results`.
   - `i` is `n`, and since the loop counter is not explicitly used, `i` does not change.
   - `ans` and `cnt` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operation is specified that would change these variables.

Given the above analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`results` contains a single string which is the str representation of `ans`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the cumulative sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each `i` from `0` to `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` up to the `n`-th element, and `t` is decreased by 1.**
