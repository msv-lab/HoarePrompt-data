Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of all values in `v`, `ans` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `idx` is increased by 1, `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables (`cnt`, `ans`, `results`, `n`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
