Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. The value of `n` and `x` remain unchanged, and `idx` is increased by 1 as per the initial state.
