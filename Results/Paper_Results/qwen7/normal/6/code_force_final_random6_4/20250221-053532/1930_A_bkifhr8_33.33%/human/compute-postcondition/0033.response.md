Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2, or 0 plus twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2; `i` is 3 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0. If `len(lst)` is not 2, `lst` is updated to `[lst[2], ..., lst[n-1]]`. If `len(lst)` is 2, `lst` remains as `[lst[0], lst[1]]`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
