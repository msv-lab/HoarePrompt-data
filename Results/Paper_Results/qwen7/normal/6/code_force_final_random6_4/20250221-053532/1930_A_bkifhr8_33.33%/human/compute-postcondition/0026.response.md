Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2, or twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2 or the second element has been removed if the length is not 2. `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 1 if `len(lst)` is 2 or the second element has been removed. `n` is greater than 0 in both cases.
