Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` converted to integer, `lst` has had its first element (at index 0) removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is `0`, from the list `lst`. Since `0 * 2` evaluates to `0`, the first element of `lst` is removed. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
