Output State: **`ans` is either 0 plus twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2, or 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2; `i` is 3 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is 2; `lst` is `[lst[2], ..., lst[n-1]]` and `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. This means the first three elements of the list are removed, leaving only `[lst[2], ..., lst[n-1]]`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged based on the length of the updated list `lst`.
