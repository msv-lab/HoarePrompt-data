Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` by the amount of that minimum value, `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2`, and `lst` is modified to remove the element at index 2.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `1 * 2`, which is index 2, from the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
