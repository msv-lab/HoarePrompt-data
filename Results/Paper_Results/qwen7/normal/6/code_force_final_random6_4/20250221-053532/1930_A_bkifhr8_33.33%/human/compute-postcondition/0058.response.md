Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`**.

The code updates the variable `ans` by adding to it the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` after converting them to integers. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
