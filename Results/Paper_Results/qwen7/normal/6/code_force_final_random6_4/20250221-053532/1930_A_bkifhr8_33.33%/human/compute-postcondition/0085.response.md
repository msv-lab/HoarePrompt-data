Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `ans`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
