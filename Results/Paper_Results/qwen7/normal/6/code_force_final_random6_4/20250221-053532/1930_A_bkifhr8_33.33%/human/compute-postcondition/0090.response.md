Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is `0`) from the list `lst`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
