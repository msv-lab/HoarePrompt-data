Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2` and the element at index 2, or `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2` or the element at index 2 depending on the condition `len(lst) != 2`.**
