Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2 + 1`, `l` is the input string from the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the input string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list of substrings to the variable `lst`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
