Output State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is increased by 1, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` on spaces.**

Explanation: The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` at each space character and assigns the resulting list of substrings to `lst`. The other variables (`ans` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
