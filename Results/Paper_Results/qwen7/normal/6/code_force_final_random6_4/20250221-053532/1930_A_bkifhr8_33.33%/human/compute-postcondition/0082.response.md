Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, the length of `lst` is now 0, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. Since `lst` initially had only one element, removing the element at index 2 results in `lst` being empty. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
