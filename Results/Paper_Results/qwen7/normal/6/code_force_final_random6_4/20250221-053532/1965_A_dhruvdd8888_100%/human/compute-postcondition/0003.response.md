Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original set, and '0' is included.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each element in the set `nums` to an integer using `map(int, nums)`, sorts the resulting list of integers, and assigns it back to `nums`. Since '0' was already added to the set, it remains in the list but is now an integer. The original set `nums` is no longer used; instead, `nums` now holds a sorted list of integers.
