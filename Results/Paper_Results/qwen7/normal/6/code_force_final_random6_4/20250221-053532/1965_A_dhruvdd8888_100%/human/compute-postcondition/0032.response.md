Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop condition. In this case, the loop head involves `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` to `1` (since the step is `-1`). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than `0`. Since `i` is currently `len(nums) - 3`, the loop can execute again as long as `len(nums) - 3 > 0`, which simplifies to `len(nums) > 3`.

4. **Adjust the states**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(nums) - 2`.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`cw` and `nw`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition alone.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cw` is a boolean flag, `nw` equals `cw`, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`**
