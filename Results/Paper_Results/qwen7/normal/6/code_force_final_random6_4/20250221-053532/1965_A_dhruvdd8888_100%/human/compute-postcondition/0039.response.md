Output State: `cw` is a boolean flag, `nw` equals `cw`, `i` is `0`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1`. After the loop completes, `i` will be decremented to `0`. Since the loop condition is `i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)`, once `i` reaches `0`, the loop stops. At this point, `cw` and `nw` will retain their last values determined by the loop's final iteration, and `i` will be `0`.
