Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the initial configuration of stone piles. The game rules dictate that players must remove a positive integer \(k\) (where \(k\) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile) from each nonempty pile simultaneously, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the following issues are present:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly process the input piles of stones.
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not simulate the game moves and determine the winner based on the game rules.
   - The code attempts to use a set and sorting, which is not relevant to the game logic.
   - The variables `nw` and `cw` are not used to determine the winner of the game but seem to be part of an unrelated calculation.

Given these issues, the provided code does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
