Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cw` is a boolean flag.
   - `nw` is equal to `cw`.
   - `i` is within the range defined by `len(nums) - 2` to `0` (inclusive), but we need to know its exact value.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` to `0` in reverse order. This means `i` starts from `len(nums) - 2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - The values of `cw` and `nw` depend on the value of `nums[i]` from the previous iteration. Specifically, if `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` was set to `False`; otherwise, `cw` was set to `True`. Therefore, `nw` will also be either `False` or `True` based on the same condition.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - `cw` and `nw` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to these variables within the loop.

Given this reasoning, let's formulate the new state:

- If `i` was `len(nums) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `len(nums) - 3`.
- `cw` and `nw` will retain their previous values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cw` is a boolean flag; if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, then `cw` is set to False, otherwise `cw` is set to True; `nw` is equal to `cw`, `i` is `len(nums) - 3`**.
