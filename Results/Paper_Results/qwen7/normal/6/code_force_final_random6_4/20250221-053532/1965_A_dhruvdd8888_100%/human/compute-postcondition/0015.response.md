Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `nums`; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; each element in `nums` has been reduced by its corresponding cumulative `ls` value starting from the first iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the index `i` will be equal to the total number of elements in the `nums` list. The variable `ls` will hold the sum of all the original values in the `nums` list. Each element in the `nums` list will have been decreased by the cumulative value of `ls` as it was updated in each iteration of the loop.
