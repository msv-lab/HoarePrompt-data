Output State: **`i` is 2, `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus `nums[1]`, `nums[1]` is 0, `nums[i]` (which is `nums[2]`) is decreased by `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `nums[i] -= ls` decreases the value of `nums[i]` by `ls`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `nums[2]` is decreased by `ls`. Since `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus `nums[1]`, and `nums[1]` is decreased by `ls`, `nums[1]` becomes 0. Therefore, `ls` now only contains its original value since `nums[1]` no longer contributes to it. Thus, `nums[2]` is decreased by `ls`.
