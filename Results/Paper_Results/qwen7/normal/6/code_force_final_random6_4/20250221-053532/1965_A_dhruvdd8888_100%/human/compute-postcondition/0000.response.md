Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that the sum of `N` over all test cases does not exceed `2⋅10^5` is still valid.
