Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where players take turns removing a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The key to solving this is understanding the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles), which determines the winner when both players play optimally.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner. Specifically, it does not use the Nim-sum approach.
   - Instead, it performs operations that do not align with the game rules or the correct solution strategy.
   - The function sorts the list of pile sizes and then iterates through them to set a boolean flag `cw` based on the value of the second-to-last element. This is not related to the correct solution for the game described.

3. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.
   - The provided function does not perform this calculation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, it will produce incorrect results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **False**
