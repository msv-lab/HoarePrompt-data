Output State: **`cw` is False, `nums` is a list of integers, the current value of `nums[i]` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `cw` is assigned the value of `not nw`. Since `nw` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. However, since `cw` is assigned the negation of `nw`, if `nw` were `True`, `cw` would be `False`, and vice versa. The list `nums` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, the only updated variable is `cw`, which is now `False`, while `nums` retains its initial state.
