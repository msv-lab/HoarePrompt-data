Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - According to the given state, `i` is initially equal to the length of `nums`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs with `i` ranging from `len(nums) - 2` to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time (`range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)`).

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than `len(nums) - 1`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `len(nums)`, the loop will start executing as long as `len(nums) - 2 >= 1`, which simplifies to `len(nums) >= 3`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least 2 (since the loop starts from `len(nums) - 2` and goes down to 1).

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should be at least 2.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is at least 2, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, each element in `nums` has been reduced by its corresponding cumulative `ls` value starting from the first iteration, `nw` is set to True, `cw` is True**
