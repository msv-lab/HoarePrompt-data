Output State: **`i` is 0; `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus the first element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `ls += nums[i]` increments `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`, which is the first element of the list `nums` since `i` is 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `ls`. Therefore, `ls` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the first element of `nums`.
