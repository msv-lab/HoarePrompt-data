Output State: **`i` is 1; `ls` is the original value of `ls` plus the first element of `nums`; `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) is decreased by `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `nums[i] -= ls` subtracts the value of `ls` from `nums[i]`, where `i` is 1. So, `nums[1]` is decreased by `ls`. The values of `i` and `ls` remain unchanged, and the length condition for `nums` is still satisfied.
