Postcondition: `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 3` (or `a1 - a2 - 5` if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'), `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 2`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 4, and if `hd > 0`, then `hd` is adjusted to `a1 - a2 - 4` (or `a1 - a2 - 6` if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'), `n` is decremented by 1, and `res` remains unchanged; otherwise, `n` remains unchanged and `res` remains unchanged.
