Output State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2 - 3` (or `a1 - a2 - 5` if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'), `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 1`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
