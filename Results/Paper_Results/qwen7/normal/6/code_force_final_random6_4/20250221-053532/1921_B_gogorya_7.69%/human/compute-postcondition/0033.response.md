Output State: **After all iterations, `n` must be equal to `i`, `res` will be the sum of all occurrences where `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for all valid `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `hd` will be the difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` at the end of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will reflect the total number of iterations performed, which is equivalent to the final value of `i`. The variable `res` will hold the total count of positions where the character '1' appears in `s1` and the character '0' appears in `s2`. The variable `hd` will represent the net difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and the number of '1's in `s2` after processing all characters up to `i`.
