The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but affects the flow of the loop. Given the initial conditions, the loop or iteration continues as before, but the specific conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hd` is decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1'` and `s2[i+1] == '0'`, and the condition `s1[i+1] == '1' and s2[i+1] == '0'` is checked whether `hd` is greater than 0 or not. If `hd` is greater than 0, the loop or iteration continues as before; if not, the condition remains unchanged.**
