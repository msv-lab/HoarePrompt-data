Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1, the condition `s1[i+1] == '1' and s2[i+1] == '0'` is checked whether `hd` is greater than 0 or not. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1 and the loop or iteration continues as before; if not, the condition remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. It does not affect the conditions related to `s1`, `s2`, `hd`, or `n`. Therefore, the precondition remains the same except for the updated value of `res`.
