Output State: **`hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, `res` is equal to `res` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given the precondition that if `hd > 0`, the value of `hd` is reduced by 1, and since the condition evaluates to true, `hd` is indeed reduced by 1. The value of `res` is also updated to reflect the increment.
