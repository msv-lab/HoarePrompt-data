The function processes a list of integers `a` and generates a new list `ans` based on specific transformations. Initially, it increments each element in `a` by its index plus one. Then, it creates a counter for the elements in `a`, removes duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and calculates the difference between consecutive elements. It appends these differences to `ans` and adjusts the counter accordingly. Finally, it appends a sequence of decremented values starting from the last element of the modified list `a` until `cnt` becomes zero. The function prints the resulting list `ans`.
