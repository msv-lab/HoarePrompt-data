Output State: `j` is equal to `adv`, `adv` must be at least 3, `ans` is a list containing the values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`.

Explanation: Since the loop runs for `adv` times and each iteration appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans`, after `adv` iterations, `j` will be equal to `adv`. The list `ans` will contain the values starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2`.
