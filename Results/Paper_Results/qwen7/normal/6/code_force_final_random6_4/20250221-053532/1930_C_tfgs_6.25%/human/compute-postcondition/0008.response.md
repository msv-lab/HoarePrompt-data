Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is 9999; `a` is a list where each element `a[j]` (for 0 â‰¤ j < n) is equal to the initial value of `a[j]` plus `j + 1`.

To break it down:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, so if `n` is 10000, `i` will be 9999 after the last iteration.
- For each iteration, `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. Therefore, after all iterations, `a[j]` will be the initial value of `a[j]` plus the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n`. This can be expressed as `a[j] = a[j] + (1 + 2 + ... + n)`. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. So, `a[j]` will be the initial value of `a[j]` plus `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
