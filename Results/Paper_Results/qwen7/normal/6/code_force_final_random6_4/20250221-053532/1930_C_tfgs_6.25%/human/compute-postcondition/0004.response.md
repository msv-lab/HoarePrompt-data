Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 0
   - `a[0]` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. 

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the increment (which happens at the end of each iteration), `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 because `i` needs to be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
