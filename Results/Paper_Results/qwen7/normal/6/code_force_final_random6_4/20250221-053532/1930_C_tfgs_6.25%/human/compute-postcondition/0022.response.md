Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was previously containing `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, after appending, `ans` will contain the new element `a[i - 1] - j - 1` in addition to the existing elements. All other variables (`adv`, `i`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
