Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`, `ans` containing all the elements as specified by the loop's logic, `cnt` being reduced to `0`, and `counter` having decremented the count of each element in `a` by the number of times it was appended to `ans`.

To break it down:
- `i` will be `len(a)` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the list `a`.
- `ans` will contain all the elements generated according to the loop's logic, which involves decrementing the count of each element in `a` and appending the appropriate values to `ans`.
- `cnt` will be `0` since it is decremented by `adv` each time in the loop, and `adv` is always less than or equal to `cnt`.
- `counter` will reflect the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented accordingly.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 2, `cnt` must be greater than 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
