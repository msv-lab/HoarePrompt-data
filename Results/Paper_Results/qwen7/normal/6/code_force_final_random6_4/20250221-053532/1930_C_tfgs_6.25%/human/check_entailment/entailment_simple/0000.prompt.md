Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

# Annotated Program:

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`; `a` will be a list where each element `a[j]` (for 0 ≤ j < n) will be equal to the initial value of `a[j]` plus `j+1`.
    #
    #This means that if the loop runs `n` times, the final value of `a[j]` for any valid index `j` will be the initial value of `a[j]` increased by `j + 1`. The variable `n` itself will retain its initial value, and `i` will be set to `n - 1` after the last iteration.

    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`, `ans` containing all the elements as specified by the loop's logic, `cnt` being reduced to `0`, and `counter` having decremented the count of each element in `a` by the number of times it was appended to `ans`.
    #
    #To break it down:
    #- `i` will be `len(a)` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the list `a`.
    #- `ans` will contain all the elements generated according to the loop's logic, which involves decrementing the count of each element in `a` and appending the appropriate values to `ans`.
    #- `cnt` will be `0` since it is decremented by `adv` each time in the loop, and `adv` is always less than or equal to `cnt`.
    #- `counter` will reflect the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented accordingly.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`, `ans` containing a sequence of decremented values starting from the initial last element of `a` and decreasing by 1 for each iteration, `cnt` being reduced to `0`, and `counter` having decremented the count of each element in `a` by the number of times it was appended to `ans`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
    #- `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`.
    #- `ans` will be a list where the initial last element of `a` is repeatedly decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
    #- `cnt` will be `0` since it is decremented with each iteration and cannot go below zero.
    #- `counter` will show the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented according to the loop's logic.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: last_element_of_a last_element_of_a - 1 last_element_of_a - 2 ... 1 0 (where last_element_of_a is the last element of the list `a`)
