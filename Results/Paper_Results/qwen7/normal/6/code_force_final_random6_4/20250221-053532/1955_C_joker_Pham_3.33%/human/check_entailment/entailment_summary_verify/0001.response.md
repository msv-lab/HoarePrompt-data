### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` which is supposed to calculate the number of ships sunk. This function should handle the logic of attacking the ships according to the specified pattern.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - The loop checks if `k` is zero, breaking early if there are no more attacks to perform.
   - If `l` and `r` are at the same position, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the ship at that position.
   - If the durability of the leftmost ship is less than or equal to the rightmost ship, it performs the necessary attacks and updates the durability and count of sunk ships.
   - If the durability of the rightmost ship is less than the leftmost ship, it performs similar operations but on the rightmost ship.
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the durability of the ship is exactly equal to the remaining attacks (`a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`).
   - It also handles the case where both ships have the same durability and the remaining attacks are exactly twice the durability (`a[l] * 2 == k`).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is the expected output format.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic in the `func_1` function:

- **Incorrect Handling of Durability Updates**:
  - The function updates the durability of the ships incorrectly. Specifically, when performing attacks, it subtracts the full durability of the ship from `k` instead of decrementing `k` by 1 for each attack. This leads to incorrect calculations of the number of attacks performed.
  
- **Break Conditions**:
  - The function breaks early when `k` is zero, but it does not correctly account for the fact that the Kraken might still need to attack the same ship multiple times before moving to the next ship.

- **Sunk Ships Count**:
  - The function increments the `sunks` counter prematurely without ensuring that the ship has actually sunk. For example, if the durability of a ship is reduced to zero, it should be marked as sunk, but the current logic does not properly handle this.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem description:

- **Example Input**:
  - `n = 4`, `k = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  
- **Expected Output**:
  - After the first attack, `a = [0, 2, 4, 3]`. The first ship is sunk.
  - After the second attack, `a = [0, 2, 3]`. The last ship is sunk.
  - After the third attack, `a = [1, 2, 2]`. The first ship is sunk.
  - After the fourth attack, `a = [1, 1, 2]`. The last ship is sunk.
  - After the fifth attack, `a = [0, 1, 1]`. The first ship is sunk.
  - Final state: `a = [1, 1]`. No more attacks are performed.

- **Actual Output**:
  - The function incorrectly counts the number of sunk ships, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate due to the logical errors in the `func_1` function. The function does not correctly simulate the attacks and update the durability of the ships, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
