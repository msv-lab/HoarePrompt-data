Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is equal to 7 if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is equal to 6 if `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r - 1`. If `k == 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, ensuring that the conditions specified in the precondition are maintained and adding the specific outcome of the if condition being met.
