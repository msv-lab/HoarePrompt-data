Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is now `l + 1` (which was either 1, 2, or `r - 1` or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is increased by 2, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[l-1]\), `a[r-1]` is decreased by \(a[l-1]\), and `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now `l + 1`.
- The variable `r` is decreased by 1, so `r` is now `r - 1`.
- The variable `sunks` is increased by 1 twice, so `sunks` is increased by 2.
- The variable `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[l-1]\).
- The variable `a[r-1]` is decreased by \(a[l-1]\).
- The value of `r` is also decreased by 1, so `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`).
