Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1 or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is equal to 5, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, where `a[r]` is an element from the list `a` at index `r`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
