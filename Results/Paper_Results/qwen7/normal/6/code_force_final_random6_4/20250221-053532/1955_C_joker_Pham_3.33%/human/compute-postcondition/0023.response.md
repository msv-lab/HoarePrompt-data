Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1; `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` subtracts the value of `a[l]` from `a[r]`. Given that initially `l` equals `r`, the operation effectively sets `a[r]` to `0` because `a[r] - a[l]` results in `a[r] - a[r]`, which is `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a` (except for the updated `a[r]`), `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged.
