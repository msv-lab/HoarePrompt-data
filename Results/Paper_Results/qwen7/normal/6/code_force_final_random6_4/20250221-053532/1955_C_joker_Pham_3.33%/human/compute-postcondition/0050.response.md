Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is either 1 or `r`, `r` is either `n - 2` or equal to `l`, and `sunks` is either 3 or 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
