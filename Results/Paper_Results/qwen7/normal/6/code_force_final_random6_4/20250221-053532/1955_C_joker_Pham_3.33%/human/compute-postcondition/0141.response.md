Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is either 8, 9, or 7 depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains a positive integer, `n` and `k` remain positive integers with the given constraints. The list `a` and the variable `l` remain unchanged. The variable `r` is decreased by 1. The variable `sunks` is increased by 1. The variable `k` is reduced by `2 * a[l]`, and the element `a[r]` in the list `a` is decreased by `a[l]`. The value of `sunks` depends on the original value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`.
