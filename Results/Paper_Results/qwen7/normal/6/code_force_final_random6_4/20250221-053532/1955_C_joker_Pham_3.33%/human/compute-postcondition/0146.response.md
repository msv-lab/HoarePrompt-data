Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is increased by 2, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[l-1]\), `a[r-1]` is decreased by \(a[l-1]\), and `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged from their previous states.
- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `r` is decremented by 1 (or set to `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`).
- `sunks` is increased by 2.
- `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[l-1]\).
- `a[r-1]` is decreased by \(a[l-1]\).
- `r` is further decremented by 1.
- The loop continues to the next iteration without executing any further statements in the current one.
