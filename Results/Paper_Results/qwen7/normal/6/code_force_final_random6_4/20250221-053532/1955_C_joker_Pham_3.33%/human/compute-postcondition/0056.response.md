Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 3, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r] - 2 * a[r]`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, where `r` is `n - 2`. Since the initial condition was that `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[r]`, after subtracting `2 * a[r]` from `k`, the new value of `k` is still greater than or equal to zero (as `k` was initially at least `2 * a[r]`). Therefore, the updated value of `k` is `k - 2 * a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
