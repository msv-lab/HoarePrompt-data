Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is either 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, or 8 depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**

This postcondition remains unchanged because the if part does not modify the variables outside of the specific conditions it checks, and there is no else part to introduce additional changes. The if statement only checks if `k == 0` and exits the loop or if statement, which does not alter the overall state of the variables as described in the precondition.
