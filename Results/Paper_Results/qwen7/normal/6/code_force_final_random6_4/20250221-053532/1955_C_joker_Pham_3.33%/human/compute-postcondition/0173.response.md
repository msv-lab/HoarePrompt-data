Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), and `sunks` is either 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, or 8 depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`. If `a[r] < a[l]`, and `k >= 2 * a[r]`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by `2 * a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, `sunks` is increased by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.
