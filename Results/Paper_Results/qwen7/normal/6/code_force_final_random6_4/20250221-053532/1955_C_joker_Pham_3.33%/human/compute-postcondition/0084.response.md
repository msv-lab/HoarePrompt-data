Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1 or `r`, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 2` (or `r` remains as it was), and `sunks` is either 3 or 4 depending on the value of `k` and the relationship between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `l` is not greater than `r`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**
