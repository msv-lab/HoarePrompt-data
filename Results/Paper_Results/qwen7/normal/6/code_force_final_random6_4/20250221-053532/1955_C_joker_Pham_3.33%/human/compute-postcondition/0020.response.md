Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. The current value of `l` is equal to `r`, and the current value of `k` is either greater than or equal to `a[r]` or less than `a[r]` but `sunks` remains unchanged. The condition `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2` is true.
