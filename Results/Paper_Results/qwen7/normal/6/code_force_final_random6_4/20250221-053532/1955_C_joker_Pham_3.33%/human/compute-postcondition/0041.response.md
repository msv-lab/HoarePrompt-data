Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 1. The current value of `l` is equal to `r`, and the current value of `k` is not equal to `a[r] * 2 - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified and the break statement only affects the flow of the program, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
