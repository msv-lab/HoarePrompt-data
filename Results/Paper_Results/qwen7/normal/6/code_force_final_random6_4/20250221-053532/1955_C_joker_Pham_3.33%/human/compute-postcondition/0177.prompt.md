You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and a is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range n.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1

                continue
            elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:

        if a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:

                break
            else:
                break
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when `l > r` or `k == 0`. At this point, `l` will be greater than `r`, indicating that all possible operations within the loop have been exhausted. The value of `sunks` will be the total number of valid operations performed, which could range from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of `k`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of valid operations performed, denoted as 'sunks', which ranges from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of 'k'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and a (a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range n). It returns the total number of valid operations performed, denoted as 'sunks', which ranges from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of 'k'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of valid operations performed, denoted as 'sunks', which ranges from 0 to a maximum based on the initial conditions and the value of 'k'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
