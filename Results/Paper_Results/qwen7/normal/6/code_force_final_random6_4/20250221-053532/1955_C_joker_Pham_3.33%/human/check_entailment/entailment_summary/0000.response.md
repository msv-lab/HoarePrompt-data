Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to simulate the attacks by the Kraken on the ships and count the number of ships that sink.
2. The program correctly initializes the variables and iterates through the list of ship durabilities.
3. The logic inside the `while` loop checks whether the current ship at the left (`l`) or right (`r`) index should be attacked based on their durability values.
4. The program handles the special case when `l` and `r` indices point to the same ship correctly.
5. The program updates the durability values and counts the number of sunk ships appropriately.
6. The function `func_1` returns the correct count of sunk ships based on the given logic.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
