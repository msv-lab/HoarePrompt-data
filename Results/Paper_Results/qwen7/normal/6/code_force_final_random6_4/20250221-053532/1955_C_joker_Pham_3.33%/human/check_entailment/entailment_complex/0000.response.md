Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the `func_1` function step-by-step to ensure it correctly simulates the process of the Kraken attacking the ships.

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively. It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

2. **Loop Condition**: The while loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. This ensures that the function continues to check both ends of the list until there are no more ships to attack.

3. **Attack Logic**:
   - If `k` is zero, the loop breaks immediately.
   - If `l` and `r` are at the same position (`l == r`), the function checks if the remaining durability of the ship at position `r` is less than or equal to `k`. If so, the ship sinks, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop breaks.
   - If the durability of the ship at position `l` is less than or equal to the durability of the ship at position `r`, the function checks if `k` is sufficient to sink the ship at `l`. If so, it updates `k`, decreases the durability of the ship at `r`, and checks if the ship at `r` has sunk. If the ship at `r` has sunk, it decrements `r`. The ship at `l` is considered sunk, and the loop continues.
   - If the durability of the ship at position `r` is less than the durability of the ship at position `l`, similar logic applies but with positions swapped.

4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero. At this point, `sunks` holds the total number of ships sunk.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of ships sunk. There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause incorrect behavior based on the provided problem description and examples.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
