Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is equal to 8 if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * a[r]`, `sunks` is equal to 7 if `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r - 1`. If `k` is not 0, we check if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and if so, `sunks` is set to 8; otherwise, the program continues without changing `sunks`.
