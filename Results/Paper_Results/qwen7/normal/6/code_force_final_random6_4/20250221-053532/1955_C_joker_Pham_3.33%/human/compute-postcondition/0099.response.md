Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1 or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by \(2 \cdot a[l] - a[r]\), and the program continues execution after the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The program simply continues its execution after the loop or if statement it was inside.
