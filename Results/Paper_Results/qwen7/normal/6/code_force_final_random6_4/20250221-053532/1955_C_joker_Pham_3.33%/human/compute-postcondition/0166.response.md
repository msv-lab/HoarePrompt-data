Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range `n`, `l` is either 1, 2, or `r - 1` (or `n - 4` if `r` was `n - 2`), `r` is now `r - 1` (or `n - 3` if `r` was `n - 2`), `sunks` is either 8, 9, 7, 10, 11, or 9 depending on the value of `k` relative to `2 * a[r]`, and `sunks` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `sunks` has been incremented by 1. The other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described in the initial state.
