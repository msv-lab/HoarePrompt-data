The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The operation `a[r] -= a[l]` would have been performed if it were within a loop, but since it is not, the value of `a[r]` is not modified.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for all i in range `n`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, and `sunks` is 3.**
