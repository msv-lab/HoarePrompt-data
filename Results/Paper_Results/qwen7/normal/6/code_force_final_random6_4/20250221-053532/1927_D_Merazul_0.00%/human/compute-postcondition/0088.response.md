Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on two sets of integers, `a` and `b`. For each query defined by integers `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists at least one integer within the range `[l, r]` that is present in both sets `a` and `b`, or in exactly one of them. If such an integer exists, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function also ensures that `m` and `n` are both set to zero by decrementing them whenever an integer is found in one set but not the other.**
