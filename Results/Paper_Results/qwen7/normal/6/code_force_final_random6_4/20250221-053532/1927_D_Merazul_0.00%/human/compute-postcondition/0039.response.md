Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `u` is False, `v` is False, `f` is False**

Explanation: The bitwise AND assignment operator `&=` updates `f` to `f & (u | v)`. Given that `u` is False and `v` is False, `u | v` evaluates to False. Since `f` was initially False, `f & False` also results in False. All other variables remain unchanged.
