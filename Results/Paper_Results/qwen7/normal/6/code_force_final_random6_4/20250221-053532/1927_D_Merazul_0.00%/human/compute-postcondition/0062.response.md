Output State: **`i` is equal to `k`, `f` is `True` if any `i` was in either set `a` or `b` during the loop, `m` is `k // 2 - (number of `i` where both `u` and `~v` were True), `n` is `k // 2 - (number of `i` where `~u` and `v` were True)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a new set containing elements from the function `R()`, `b` is a new set containing elements from the function `R()`**.

Explanation: The line `b = {*R()}` creates a new set `b` by calling the function `R()`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, `f`, `m`, `n`, `t`, or `a`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information introduced is the creation of the set `b`, which contains elements from the function `R()`.
