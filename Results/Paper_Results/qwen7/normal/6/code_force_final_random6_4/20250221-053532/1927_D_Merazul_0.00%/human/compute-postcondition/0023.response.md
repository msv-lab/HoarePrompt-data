Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is the second element returned by `R()`, `u` is True if 3 is in `a` else False, `v` is True if `i` is in `b` else False, `f` is True, `m` is `m - 1`, `n` is `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code `v = i in b` checks if the value of `i` (which is 3) is present in the list `b`. The result of this check is assigned to `v`. Since the initial value of `v` is `False`, `v` will be set to `True` if `3` is found in `b`, otherwise it remains `False`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `u`, `f`, `m`, `n`) are not affected by this operation.
