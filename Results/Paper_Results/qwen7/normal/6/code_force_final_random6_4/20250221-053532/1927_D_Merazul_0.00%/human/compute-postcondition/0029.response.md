Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by `t`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is true.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

3. **Determine the Value of `t` for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be true. Since no information about the value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration is provided, we cannot assume anything about its current value. We need to ensure that `t` is set to true for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is true for the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be true**
