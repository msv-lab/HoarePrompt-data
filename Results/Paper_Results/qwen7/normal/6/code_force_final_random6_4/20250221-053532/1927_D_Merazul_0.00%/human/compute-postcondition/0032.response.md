Output State: **`k` is the second element of R(), `t` is 0, `a` is a set containing one element from R().**

Explanation: The code `a = {*R()}` creates a set `a` by unpacking the result of `R()` into a set literal. Since `R()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value it returns, but we know it returns a single value. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it was the second element of `R()` before the code was executed, and `t` remains 0.
