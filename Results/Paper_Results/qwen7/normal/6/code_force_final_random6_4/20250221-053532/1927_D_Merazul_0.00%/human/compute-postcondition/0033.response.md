Output State: **`k` is the second element of R(), `t` is 0, `a` is a set containing one element from R(), `b` is a set containing one element from R().**

Explanation: The code `b = {*R()}` creates a set `b` by calling the function `R()` and converting its result into a set using the set literal syntax. Since `R()` returns a single element, `b` will contain exactly one element from `R()`. The values of `k`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
