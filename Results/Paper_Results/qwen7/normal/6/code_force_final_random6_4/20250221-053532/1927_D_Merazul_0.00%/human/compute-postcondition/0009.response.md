Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `k + 1`, which means `i` will take values from `1` to `k` inclusive.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `k`**:
   - `i` should start at `1`.
   - `k` is the second element returned by the function `R()`.

4. **Check the initial state**:
   - `t` is `0`.
   - `k` is the second element returned by `R()`.
   - `a` is a set containing the first element returned by `R()`.
   - `b` is a set containing the elements returned by `R()`.
   - `f` is `1`.
   - `m` is `k // 2`.
   - `n` is `k // 2`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` should start at `1`, we need to ensure `i` is `1` at the start of the loop.
   - `k` should be the second element returned by `R()`, so we need to ensure this value is correct.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the second element returned by R()**
