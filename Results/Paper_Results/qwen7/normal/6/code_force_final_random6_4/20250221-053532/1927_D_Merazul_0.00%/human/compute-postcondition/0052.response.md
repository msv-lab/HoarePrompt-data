Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 2, `u` is False, `v` is False, `f` is False, `m` is 1, `n` is 1, `a` is not defined, `b` is not defined, `v` is False**.

Explanation: The code `v = i in b` checks if `i` (which is 3) is in the list `b`. Since `b` is not defined, the condition `i in b` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, `v` is assigned the value `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
