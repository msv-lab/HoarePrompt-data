You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `f` will be `True` if there exists at least one `i` such that `i` is in both `a` and `b`, or in exactly one of them. `m` and `n` will both be `0` because they are decremented each time `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, or in `b` but not in `a`, respectively. The values of `u` and `v` will reflect the membership of `k` in sets `a` and `b`, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of queries on two sets of integers, `a` and `b`. For each query defined by integers `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists at least one integer within the range `[l, r]` that is present in both sets `a` and `b`, or in exactly one of them. If such an integer exists, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function also ensures that `m` and `n` are both set to zero by decrementing them whenever an integer is found in one set but not the other.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem involving set operations and does not address the task of finding pairs of different elements within specified query ranges.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided program will output something entirely different because it does not correctly handle the query ranges and check for different elements within those ranges. For example, for the query `1 5`, the program should find indices 2 and 3 (where `a[2] = 2` and `a[3] = 1`), but instead, it performs set operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
