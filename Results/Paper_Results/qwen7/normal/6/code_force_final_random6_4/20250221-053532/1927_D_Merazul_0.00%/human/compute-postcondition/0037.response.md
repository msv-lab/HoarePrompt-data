Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `u` is False**

Explanation: The code `u = i in a` checks if the variable `i` (which is 1) is present in the list `a`. Since the list `a` is not defined in the initial state or provided in the code snippet, we cannot determine if `i` is in `a`. By default, this expression evaluates to `False` because `i` is not found in `a`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
