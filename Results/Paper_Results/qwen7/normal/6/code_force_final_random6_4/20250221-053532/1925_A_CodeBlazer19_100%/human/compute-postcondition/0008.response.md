Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 1, `i` is still 2, `n` is now the first integer from the input, and `k` is the second integer from the input.
