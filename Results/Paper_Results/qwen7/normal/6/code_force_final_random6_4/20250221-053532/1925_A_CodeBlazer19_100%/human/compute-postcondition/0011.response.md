Output State: The loop will execute `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of `t-1`, `n` will be the integer from the last input provided during the loop's execution, and `k` will be the second integer from the last input provided during the loop's execution. The value of `t` will remain as it was initially provided and must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 676.

This means that if the loop runs `t` times, the final state of the loop will show that `i` has reached `t-1`, and the values of `n` and `k` will be those of the last input pair processed by the loop.
