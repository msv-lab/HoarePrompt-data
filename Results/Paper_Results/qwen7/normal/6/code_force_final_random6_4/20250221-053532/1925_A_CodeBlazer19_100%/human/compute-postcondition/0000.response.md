Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and `t` is now the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676 remains valid, but now `t` specifically holds the value of the integer input provided by the user. All other conditions and constraints on `t` still apply, meaning `t` must be within the range 1 to 676 inclusive.
