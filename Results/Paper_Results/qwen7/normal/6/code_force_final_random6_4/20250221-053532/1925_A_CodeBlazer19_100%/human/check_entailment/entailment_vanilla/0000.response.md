### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is a subsequence of `s`.
   - The goal is to minimize the length of `s`. If there are multiple valid strings of the same length, any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then prints a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.

3. **Checking the Solution:**
   - Consider the example where `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The program will output `"abab"`.
   - However, we need to check if `"abab"` is the optimal solution. The correct output should be `"baab"`, as explained in the problem statement.
   - Let's verify the subsequences:
     - `"aa"`: `"baab"`
     - `"ab"`: `"baab"`
     - `"ba"`: `"baab"`

4. **Optimality Check:**
   - The string `"baab"` has the required subsequences and is shorter than `"abab"`.
   - The program does not account for the optimality condition of minimizing the length of `s`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not guarantee the minimum length of the string `s` and hence is not correct according to the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**False**
