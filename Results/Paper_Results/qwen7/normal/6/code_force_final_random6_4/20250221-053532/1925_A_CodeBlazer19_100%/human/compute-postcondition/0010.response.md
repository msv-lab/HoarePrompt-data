Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is the last integer input for each iteration, `k` is the last second integer input for each iteration.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` must still be greater than 0, the loop index `i` will be equal to the original value of `t`, and `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last integers input during any iteration of the loop. The other variables and their states remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
