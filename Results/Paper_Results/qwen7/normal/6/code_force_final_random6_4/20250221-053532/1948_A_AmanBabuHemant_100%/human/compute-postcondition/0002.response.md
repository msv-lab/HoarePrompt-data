Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The initial state was that `t` must be greater than 0. The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. Since the input function waits for user input and the `int` function converts that input to an integer, the value of `n` is now an integer obtained from the user. The condition about `t` remains unchanged.
