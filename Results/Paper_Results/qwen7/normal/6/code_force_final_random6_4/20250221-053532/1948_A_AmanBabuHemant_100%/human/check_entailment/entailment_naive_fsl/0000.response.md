Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation prints "NO" only when `n % 2` is true (i.e., `n` is odd), but it also tries to construct a string which is not possible for odd `n`. For example, if `n = 1`, the program will incorrectly attempt to construct a string and print "YES" followed by an empty string, which violates the problem constraints. Therefore, the program does not work as expected for odd values of `n`.
