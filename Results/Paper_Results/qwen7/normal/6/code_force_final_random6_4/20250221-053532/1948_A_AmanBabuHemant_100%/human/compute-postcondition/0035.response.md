Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is defined such that `t = t - 1` and it must be greater than 0. This means `t` is a positive integer that has been decremented by 1.
- The variable `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided.
- The string `s` is defined as 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is less than 200 or exactly 200, but the exact length is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, it will always print 'NO'.
