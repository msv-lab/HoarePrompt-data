Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Odd `n` Values**: The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, no suitable string can be formed and prints "NO". This part is correct.
   
2. **Even `n` Values**: For even `n`, the program generates a string using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. However, this approach doesn't always produce a string where exactly `n` characters are special. For instance, consider `n = 4`:
   - The generated string would be `"AABAAABB"`.
   - In `"AABAAABB"`, the special characters are at positions 2, 3, 6, and 7, making it 4 special characters, but the characters at positions 1, 4, 5, and 8 do not meet the criteria of being special.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the generated string has exactly `n` special characters. A better approach could involve constructing a pattern that ensures the required number of special characters. One possible solution is to use a repeating pattern like `"AB"` which inherently has the required properties for small values of `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Constructing a string with exactly n special characters
            if n <= 2:
                print('YES')
                print('AB' if n == 2 else 'A')
            else:
                s = 'AB' * (n // 2)
                if len(s) < 200:
                    print('YES')
                    print(s)
                else:
                    print('NO')

func()
```

This version checks for small values of `n` directly and constructs a valid string for larger values of `n` using the `"AB"` pattern.
