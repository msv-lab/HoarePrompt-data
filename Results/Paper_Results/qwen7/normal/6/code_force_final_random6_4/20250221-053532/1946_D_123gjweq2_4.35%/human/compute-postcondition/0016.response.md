Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element; xor is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`; `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xor` (which is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`) to `new_arr`. Since `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers and `xor` is its XOR value, `new_arr` now contains this `xor` value as its first (and only) element.
