Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into \( k \) segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed \( x \).

2. **Key Points in the Code**:
   - The code uses a recursive approach to solve the problem.
   - The function `func_1` calls `find_max` with the entire array and the highest bit position (31).
   - The function `find_max` recursively processes the array segment by segment, considering each bit position from the most significant to the least significant.
   - For each bit position, it calculates the cumulative XOR of the segment and checks if the current bit of \( x \) allows extending the segment further or starting a new one.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` correctly handles the base case when `bit` reaches -1, returning the length of the current segment.
   - The logic for updating `new_arr` and `xor` ensures that only segments whose cumulative XOR up to the current bit position does not exceed \( x \) are considered.
   - The recursion correctly handles the decision to either extend the current segment or start a new one based on the current bit of \( x \).
   - The final return statement in `find_max` correctly computes the maximum \( k \) by comparing the results of extending the current segment or starting a new one.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where no valid segments can be formed by returning -1 when necessary.
   - The recursive approach ensures that all possible segmentations are considered.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
