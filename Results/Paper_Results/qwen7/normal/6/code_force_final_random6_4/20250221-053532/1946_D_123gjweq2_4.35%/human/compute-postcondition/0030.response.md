Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the result of calling `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` and assigns its return value to `thing1`. Since `new_arr` contains only one element (which is 0) and `bit - 1` is a value less than the current bit position, the exact value of `thing1` cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `find_max`. However, we know that `thing1` now holds the result of this function call. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
