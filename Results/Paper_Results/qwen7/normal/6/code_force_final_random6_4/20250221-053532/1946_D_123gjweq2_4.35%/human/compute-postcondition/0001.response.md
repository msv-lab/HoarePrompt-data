Output State: **The program returns the length of the list 'cur_arr'**

Given that `bit` is -1, it indicates that the bit position is not relevant to the return statement. The return statement `return len(cur_arr)` simply returns the length of the list `cur_arr`. Since `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, the program returns the number of elements in this list.
