Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is -1.**

The code assigns `-1` to the variable `thing1`. This assignment does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, or `xor`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
