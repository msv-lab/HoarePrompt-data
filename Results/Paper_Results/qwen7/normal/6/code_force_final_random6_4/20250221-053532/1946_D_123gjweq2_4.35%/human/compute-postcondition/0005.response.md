Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing the current array segment being processed, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.**

The code initializes `thing1` to 0, which does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, or `xor`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
