Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter cur_arr, which is a list of non-negative integers, and a parameter bit, which is an integer representing the current bit position. Depending on the bit position, the function either returns the length of the list cur_arr, the maximum value between the result of calling itself with the previous bit position and a new list, or -1.**
