Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of 0, `xor` is 0, and `new_arr` will contain the cumulative result of the XOR operation on all elements of `cur_arr` considering each bit position from `bit` down to 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `new_arr` will contain a single element which is the result of performing an XOR operation on all elements of `cur_arr` considering each bit position starting from `bit` down to 0. If the final `xor` value is 0, it means that the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` across all bit positions is 0, and thus `new_arr` contains 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` will contain the non-zero result of the XOR operation.
