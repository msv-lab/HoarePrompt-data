Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cur_arr`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **`cur_arr`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`, the length of `cur_arr` decreases by one with each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must still have at least one element.
   - **`i`**: The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `cur_arr` during each iteration. After the previous iteration, `i` would hold the value of the last element processed.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `cur_arr` must still have at least one element for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `i` will take on the value of the next element in `cur_arr`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list**.

Since the exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements in `cur_arr`, we only need to ensure that `cur_arr` has at least one element left.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element**.
