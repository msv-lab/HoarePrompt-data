Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`**

Explanation: The code returns the maximum value between two quantities:
1. The result of calling `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which finds the maximum value in `cur_arr` considering bits up to `bit - 1`.
2. The length of `new_arr`, which currently contains only the value 0.

Since `new_arr` starts with just one element (0), its length is 1. The exact value returned depends on the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, but the program guarantees that it will return the larger of these two values.
