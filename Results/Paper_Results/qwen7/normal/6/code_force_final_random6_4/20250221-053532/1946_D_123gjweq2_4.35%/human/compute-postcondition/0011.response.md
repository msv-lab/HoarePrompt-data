Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (with 0 being the least significant bit), `new_arr` is a list containing the value of `xor`, `xor` is 0, and the current value of `xor` does not have the `bit`-th bit set to 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `xor` to 0. This means that the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is now 0, and since the initial condition stated that the current value of `xor` does not have the `bit`-th bit set to 1, this condition remains true after setting `xor` to 0.
