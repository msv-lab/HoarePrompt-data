Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `n` is set to the integer input provided by the user.
