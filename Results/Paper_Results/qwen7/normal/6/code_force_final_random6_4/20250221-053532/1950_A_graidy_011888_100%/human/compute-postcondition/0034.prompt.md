You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `range(n)` and `n` can be up to 1000), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split for the last iteration of the loop. If `a < b < c` during any iteration, 'STAIR' is printed; if `a < b` and `b > c`, 'PEAK' is printed; otherwise, 'NONE' is printed. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change within the loop unless explicitly modified in the else block, but since no such modification is specified, they retain their input values from the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains between 1 and 1000, `i` will be 999 (if `n` is set to its maximum value of 1000), and `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values entered in the last input of the loop. The printed output will be 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions met during the iterations, with `a`, `b`, and `c` retaining their last input values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the conditions provided for the integers t, a, b, and c. For each test case, if t is between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and a, b, and c are between 0 and 9 inclusive, it processes these values but the specific processing logic is not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
