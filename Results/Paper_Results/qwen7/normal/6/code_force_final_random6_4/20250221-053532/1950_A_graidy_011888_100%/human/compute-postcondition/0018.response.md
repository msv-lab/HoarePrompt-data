Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, and they are converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers, while `t` and `i` retain their original conditions and values.
