Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal. According to the problem description, if `a == b == c`, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. For example, if the input is `4 4 4`, the program will output "PEAK" instead of "NONE".
