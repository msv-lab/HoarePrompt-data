Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`).
   - If the first condition is not met, it checks if the digits form a peak (`a < b and b > c`).
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - For a stair: `a < b < c` should be checked.
   - For a peak: `a < b and b > c` should be checked.

### Verification of Conditions:

- **Stair Condition (`a < b < c`):**
  - This condition is correctly implemented with the chained comparison `a < b < c`.

- **Peak Condition (`a < b and b > c`):**
  - This condition is also correctly implemented using the logical AND operator `and`.

- **Else Condition:**
  - The `else` block correctly handles the case where neither the stair nor the peak conditions are met, printing "NONE".

### Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `1 2 3`
   - `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
   - `1 < 2 < 3` is true, so it prints "STAIR".

2. **Test Case 2:** `3 2 1`
   - `a = 3`, `b = 2`, `c = 1`
   - `3 < 2` is false, and `2 > 1` is true, but since the first part of the OR condition fails, it does not match the peak condition. So it prints "NONE".

3. **Test Case 3:** `1 5 3`
   - `a = 1`, `b = 5`, `c = 3`
   - `1 < 5 > 3` is true, so it prints "PEAK".

4. **Test Case 4:** `3 4 1`
   - `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
   - `3 < 4 > 1` is true, so it prints "PEAK".

5. **Test Case 5:** `0 0 0`
   - `a = 0`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`
   - None of the conditions are met, so it prints "NONE".

6. **Test Case 6:** `4 1 7`
   - `a = 4`, `b = 1`, `c = 7`
   - `4 < 1` is false, so it prints "NONE".

7. **Test Case 7:** `4 5 7`
   - `a = 4`, `b = 5`, `c = 7`
   - `4 < 5 < 7` is true, so it prints "STAIR".

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
