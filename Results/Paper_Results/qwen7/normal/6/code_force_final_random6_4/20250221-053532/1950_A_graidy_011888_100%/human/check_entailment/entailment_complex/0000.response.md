Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the provided function. Let's break down the function:

1. The function takes an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
2. It iterates over each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. It checks the conditions to determine if the numbers form a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b and b > c`).
5. Based on the conditions, it prints either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'.
6. The function does not return any value but directly prints the results.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. The conditions and the corresponding outputs are accurately described.

Correctness: **True**
