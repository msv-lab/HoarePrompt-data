Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list that can be iterated over.
- `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are initialized but their values are not specified.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will print the value of the variable `result`. However, since `result` is not defined or assigned any value in the provided initial state, it is impossible to determine its exact value.

Therefore, the output will be the variable `result` itself, without a specific value.

Output: **result**
