Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is an input string that has been stripped.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. The function call itself does not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. The list `results` now contains its previous elements plus the new result from `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
