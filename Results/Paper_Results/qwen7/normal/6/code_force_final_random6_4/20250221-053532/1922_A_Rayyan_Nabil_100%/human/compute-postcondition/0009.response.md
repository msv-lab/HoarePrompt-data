Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, `n` is the integer value of the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is updated to this new integer value. All other variables remain unchanged.
