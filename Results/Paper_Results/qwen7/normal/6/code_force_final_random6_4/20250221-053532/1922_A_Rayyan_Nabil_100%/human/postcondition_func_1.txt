The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and calls another function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. It collects the results of these function calls into a list and prints each result. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the list `results` contains the outputs of `func_1` for each test case, while the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are left in their final states from the last test case.
