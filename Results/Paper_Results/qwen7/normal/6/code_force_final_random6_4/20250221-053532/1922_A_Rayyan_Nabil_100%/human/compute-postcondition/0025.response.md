Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list that can be iterated over and has at least one more element.
- `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are initialized but their specific values are not provided.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will print the first element of the `results` list because it is the only reference to `result` in the code snippet, and without any further context or operations on `results`, we assume it refers to the first element.

Output: **the first element of the results list**
