You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `a` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `b` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, and `c` is the stripped input string from the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list that can be fully iterated over, containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `n` is initialized and will have been decremented to 0 or a negative value, `a` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `b` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `c` is the stripped input string from the last iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain the outputs of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for every iteration. The variable `n` will have reached 0 or a negative value as it was likely being decremented in each iteration. Variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the stripped input strings from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, along with strings a, b, and c of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns different outputs based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
