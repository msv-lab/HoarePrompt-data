Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to `b`. The values of `t`, `results`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
