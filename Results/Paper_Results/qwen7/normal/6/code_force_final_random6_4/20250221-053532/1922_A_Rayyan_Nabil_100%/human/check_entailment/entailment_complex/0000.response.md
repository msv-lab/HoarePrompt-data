Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if there exists an index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - It iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` up to length `n`.
   - If it finds such an index, it returns `'YES'`.
   - If no such index is found after iterating through all characters, it returns `'NO'`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - It checks if there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the problem's requirements.
   - The main function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
