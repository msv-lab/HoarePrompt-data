You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `n`. If during any iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, both conditions `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` were met simultaneously, the function would have returned 'YES' before completing all iterations. Since no such simultaneous mismatch was found in any of the iterations, the function will return 'NO' after completing all iterations.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be 'NO', indicating that there was no index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` were different from `c[i]` simultaneously.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO', indicating that there was no index i where both a[i] and b[i] were different from c[i] simultaneously after all iterations of the loop have finished.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 20), `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters), `b` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters), and `c` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters). It checks each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` to see if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'. If no such index exists after checking all indices, it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `a` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `b` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, and `c` is the stripped input string from the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list that can be fully iterated over, containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `n` is initialized and will have been decremented to 0 or a negative value, `a` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `b` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `c` is the stripped input string from the last iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain the outputs of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for every iteration. The variable `n` will have reached 0 or a negative value as it was likely being decremented in each iteration. Variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the stripped input strings from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and calls another function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. It collects the results of these function calls into a list and prints each result. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the list `results` contains the outputs of `func_1` for each test case, while the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are left in their final states from the last test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` can consist of lowercase or uppercase letters.
   - If a template character is lowercase, the corresponding characters in `a`, `b`, and `c` must match.
   - If a template character is uppercase, the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.

2. **Analyzing the Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'.
   - If no such position exists, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. It does not consider the case where `t[i]` is uppercase.
   - For a template to work, we need to ensure that:
     - Both `a` and `b` match the template.
     - `c` does not match the template.
   - The current implementation does not check these conditions properly.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to create a template where:
     - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can set `t[i]` to be lowercase and equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, we can set `t[i]` to be uppercase.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and equal to `c[i]`, we cannot form a valid template.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the function is incorrect.
