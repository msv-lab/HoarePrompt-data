Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The key variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the stripped input string.
   - `b` is the stripped input string.
   - `c` is the stripped input string.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. If `t` was decremented by 1 in the loop body, then `t` would now be `t - 1`. Since the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, `t` must be adjusted to `t - 1`.

5. **Update the other variables**: The other variables (`results`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string**.
