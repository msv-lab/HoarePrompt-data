The only variable in the loop head is `_`, but since it is a placeholder and does not hold any value, we do not need to adjust any specific variable related to it. However, the loop condition depends on the variable `t`, which must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, and `c` is an input string that has been stripped.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 1. Since the loop decrements or modifies `t` each iteration, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's assume `t` was decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `t` must now be greater than 0 (since it was initially greater than 1 and has been decremented by 1).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` appended, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is an input string that has been stripped**
