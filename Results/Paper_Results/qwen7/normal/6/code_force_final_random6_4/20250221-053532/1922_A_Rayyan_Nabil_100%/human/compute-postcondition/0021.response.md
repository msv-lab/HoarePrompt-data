Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `a` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `b` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, and `c` is the stripped input string from the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` will still be an integer greater than 0 (as it started as an integer between 1 and 1000 and no operations change it).
- The `results` list will contain the output of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values of the last inputs provided by the user during the final iteration of the loop.
