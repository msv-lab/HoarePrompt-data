Output State: `results` is a list that can be fully iterated over, `n` is initialized to the value it had after the third iteration, `a` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `b` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `c` is the stripped input string from the last iteration.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, as they are not re-initialized or modified within the loop body based on the given information.
