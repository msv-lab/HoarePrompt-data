Output State: `results` is a list that can be fully iterated over, containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `n` is initialized and will have been decremented to 0 or a negative value, `a` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `b` is the stripped input string from the last iteration, `c` is the stripped input string from the last iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain the outputs of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for every iteration. The variable `n` will have reached 0 or a negative value as it was likely being decremented in each iteration. Variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the stripped input strings from the last iteration of the loop.
