Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is -1.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `k` is updated in a loop based on the characters in the string `t` from the end to the beginning.
- `q2` is incremented by 1 for each 'R' encountered from the end of the string.
- `q1` is decremented by 1 for each character that is not 'R' from the end of the string.
- `y` is a list of `n` zeros, with the last element (`y[-1]`) being the final value of `k` after the loop completes.

Given this, after the loop completes, `y` will be a list of `n` zeros, with the last element being the final value of `k`.

Let's break down the process:

1. The loop iterates over the string `t` from the end to the beginning.
2. For each character in `t`, it updates `k` as `k * a[q2] % m` if the character is 'R', or `k * a[q1] % m` otherwise.
3. `q2` is incremented by 1 for each 'R'.
4. `q1` is decremented by 1 for each character that is not 'R'.
5. After the loop, `y[-1]` holds the final value of `k`.

Since `y` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros and the last element (`y[-1]`) is set to the final value of `k`, `y` will be a list of `n` zeros, with the last element being the final value of `k`.

Therefore, the `print(*y)` statement will print the elements of the list `y`, which are `n` zeros followed by the final value of `k`.

Output: **0 0 0 ... 0 [final_value_of_k]** (where there are `n-1` zeros followed by the final value of `k`)
