Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `ii` must be an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string representation of `t`, `k` is updated based on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted accordingly, `y` is a list of `n` zeros, and `y[-1]` is `k`. If the last character of `t` is 'R', then `k` is updated to `k * a[l] % m` (or `k * a[l + 1] % m` if the last character is 'R'), `q2` is incremented by 1, and `t[ii]` is set to 'R'. Otherwise, `q1` is decremented by 1, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `t[ii]` is not 'R'.**
