Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `t = input()` assigns the value of the input string to the variable `t`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
