### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components and logic of the provided program. However, there are a few points to verify and ensure the program works as intended:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The initialization part seems correct, setting the first support cost to 1 and adding 2 for the next `d-1` positions.
   - The heap initialization and dynamic programming logic are sound, ensuring that the distance between supports is maintained.
   - The use of a min-heap is appropriate for efficiently managing the costs and indices.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The input parsing and handling are correct.
   - The calculation of costs for each row using `func_1` is done correctly.
   - The summation of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows is correct.
   - The final step of finding the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows is also correct.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The heap is initialized with the first `d` elements, which is correct for starting the dynamic programming process.

2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - The loop updates the cost for each position `i` from `d` to the end of the row. It removes elements from the heap that do not satisfy the distance constraint (`i - (d + 2)`).
   - The new cost is calculated as `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, which correctly accounts for the existing cost plus the new support cost.
   - The updated cost is pushed back into the heap, ensuring the heap remains valid.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The heap operations (`heappop` and `heappush`) are used correctly to maintain the minimum cost within the required distance constraint.

4. **Cost Calculation for Consecutive Rows**:
   - The summation of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows is done correctly using a sliding window approach.
   - The minimum total cost is found accurately by iterating through all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Edge Cases

- **Row Length Less Than `d`**: If the row length is less than `d`, the program will still work correctly because the heap will only contain the necessary elements.
- **Single Bridge (`k=1`)**: The program handles this case correctly by simply summing the costs for each row.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum cost of placing supports in each row and then finding the minimum cost for consecutive rows. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
