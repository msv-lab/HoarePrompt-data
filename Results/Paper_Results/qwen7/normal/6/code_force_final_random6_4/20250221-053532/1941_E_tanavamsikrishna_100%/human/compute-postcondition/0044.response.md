Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `d` remains the same, the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and `e` is pushed into `min_heap`.**

Explanation: The code pushes the element `e` into the `min_heap`. The values of `i`, `d`, and the condition related to the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` remain unchanged. Additionally, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
