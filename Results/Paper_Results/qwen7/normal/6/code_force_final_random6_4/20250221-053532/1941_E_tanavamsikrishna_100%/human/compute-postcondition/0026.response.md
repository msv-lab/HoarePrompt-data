Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the result of `heappop(min_heap)[1]`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as the popped element from the heap (`e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

3. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `heappop(min_heap)[1]` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Since `i` is `d + 3` or more, `i - (d + 2)` simplifies to `1` or more.
   - Therefore, `heappop(min_heap)[1]` must be less than or equal to `1` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only variable that can be adjusted directly is `i`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` should be such that `heappop(min_heap)[1]` can still satisfy the condition `heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

### Conclusion:
- The state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3` and `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is greater than or equal to `d + 3` and `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**
