Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells; `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `total_costs`. No changes are made to the existing values of `rows` and `costs`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while adding that `total_costs` is now an empty list.
