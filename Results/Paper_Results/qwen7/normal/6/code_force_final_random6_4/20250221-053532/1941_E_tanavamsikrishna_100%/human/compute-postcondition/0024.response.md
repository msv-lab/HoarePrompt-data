Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head condition is `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - `e` is popped from `min_heap`.
   - `(e := heappop(min_heap))` assigns the popped element to `e` and returns it.
   - `e[1]` is compared with `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Determine the Initial States:**
   - `min_heap` contains the element `(row[i], i)`.
   - `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `d` is unchanged.

3. **Analyze the Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `e[1]` (which is initially `i`) must satisfy the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to `i + 1` after popping from the heap, so the condition becomes `e[1] <= (i - 1) - (d + 2)`, simplifying to `e[1] <= i - d - 3`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `e[1]` is initially `i` (from the state before the loop), for the loop to execute, `i` must be such that `i - d - 3` is valid.
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least `d + 3` for the loop to execute the first time.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure the loop condition is met. Specifically, `i` must be greater than or equal to `d + 3`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`min_heap` contains the element `(row[i], i)`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, `i` must be greater than or equal to `d + 3`, `d` is unchanged**
