Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row under the given constraints.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The first support is always placed at the start of the row (`row[0] = 1`).
   - For the next `d-1` cells, the cost is increased by 2 (`row[i] = row[i] + 2`).

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row.
   - Each element in the heap is a tuple `(cost, index)`.

3. **Heap Processing**:
   - For each subsequent cell from `d` to the end of the row:
     - Elements in the heap are popped until the current index is more than `d+1` positions away from the smallest element in the heap.
     - The cost of the current cell is updated based on the smallest element in the heap plus 1.
     - The current cell's cost is pushed back into the heap.

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function processes the entire input and calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges over `k` consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - Read the depth values for each row.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**:
   - For each row, call `func_1` to get the minimum cost of placing supports.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - Calculate the total cost for placing supports in each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Find the minimum total cost among these sets.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the minimum total cost.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Heap Usage**:
   - The heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost support placement while maintaining the required distance constraint.

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The initial setup ensures that the first and last supports are correctly placed.
   - The heap processing ensures that the distance constraint is maintained.

3. **Algorithm Completeness**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles all given constraints and computes the minimum cost for each row.
   - The total cost calculation is done correctly by considering all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases such as small `d` values and multiple rows efficiently.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of placing supports for building `k` bridges over `k` consecutive rows. The use of a min-heap ensures efficient computation and adherence to the distance constraint.

**Correctness: True**
