Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every k consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `len(costs)` must be greater than or equal to `k` - 1, and `total_costs` is updated by appending the sum of the first `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the first `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list to the `total_costs` list. Since `i` is initially set to 1, the sum of the first `k` elements (from index 1 to index `k-1`) is added to `total_costs`. The other variables remain unchanged.
