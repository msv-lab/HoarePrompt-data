Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\) and \(T > 3\). This means `T` can be any integer from 4 to 1000.
- `i` is 3.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, assigned the values from the input split by space.

The code snippet only contains a single `print` statement:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement will print the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **Bob**
