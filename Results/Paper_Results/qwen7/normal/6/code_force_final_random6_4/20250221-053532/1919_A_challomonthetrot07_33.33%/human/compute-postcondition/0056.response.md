Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\) and \(T > 3\). This means `T` is any integer between 4 and 1000, inclusive.
- `i` is 3.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, assigned the values from the input split by space.

The `print('Bob')` statement simply prints the string 'Bob'. The values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not relevant to this specific print statement because it does not reference them.

Output: **Bob**
