Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is even.
- `a` is divisible by 2 while `b` is not divisible by 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```
