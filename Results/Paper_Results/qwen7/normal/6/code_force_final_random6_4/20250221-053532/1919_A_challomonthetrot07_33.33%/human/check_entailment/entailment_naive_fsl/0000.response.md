Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for both players when `a` and `b` are not equal and both are greater than 1. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

Consider the test case `(a, b) = (3, 3)`. According to the problem description, both players should play optimally. Hereâ€™s how the game would proceed if both players play optimally:

1. Alice starts with `a = 3` and `b = 3`.
2. Alice can either swap or not swap. If she swaps, `a = 3` and `b = 3`, and it becomes Bob's turn.
3. Bob now has `a = 3` and `b = 3`. He can either swap or not swap. If he swaps, `a = 3` and `b = 3`, and it becomes Alice's turn again.
4. This process repeats until one of them cannot make a valid move.

Since both players can always swap back and forth without losing, the game will continue indefinitely unless one of them makes a mistake. However, the provided program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case because it does not account for the possibility of an infinite loop or the optimal strategy when both players have an odd number of coins.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
