Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Let's analyze why it is incorrect and provide the correct solution.

#### Issues in the Given Solution:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Parity:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 1` and `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` do not fully capture the optimal strategy.
   - The parity (odd/even nature) of the numbers of coins in the wallets plays a crucial role in determining the winner.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic:**
   - The conditions like `elif a > b` and `else: print('Alice')` are not sufficient to cover all scenarios.

#### Correct Approach:
- If both players have the same number of coins, the player whose turn it is will lose because they will eventually end up with zero coins and be unable to make a move.
- If one player has an odd number of coins and the other has an even number, the player with the odd number of coins can always force a win by ensuring that the opponent is left with an even number of coins.
- If both players have an even number of coins, the player whose turn it is can always ensure that the opponent ends up with an even number of coins, thus forcing the opponent into a losing position.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This solution checks:
- If `a == b`, then Bob wins.
- If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, then Bob wins because he can always force the game into a state where the sum remains even.
- Otherwise, Alice wins.
