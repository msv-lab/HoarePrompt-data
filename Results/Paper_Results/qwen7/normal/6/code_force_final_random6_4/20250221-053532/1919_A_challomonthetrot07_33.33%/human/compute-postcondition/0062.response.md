Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\) and \(T > 3\).
- `i` is 3.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, assigned the values from the input split by space.

The `print('Alice')` statement simply prints the string 'Alice'. Since the values of `a` and `b` are not used in this print statement, they do not affect the output.

Output: **Alice**
