Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial number of coins `a` and `b` in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
2. The annotated program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement:
   - If `a == b`, Bob wins.
   - If `a == 1`, Alice wins.
   - If `b == 1`, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, Bob wins.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Alice wins.
   - If `a > b`, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.
3. The logic in the program matches the given examples and the provided test cases.
4. The program iterates over each test case and prints the correct winner based on the conditions.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
