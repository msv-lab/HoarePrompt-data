Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it determines whether "Alice" or "Bob" wins based on specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\), and prints the winner for each case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
