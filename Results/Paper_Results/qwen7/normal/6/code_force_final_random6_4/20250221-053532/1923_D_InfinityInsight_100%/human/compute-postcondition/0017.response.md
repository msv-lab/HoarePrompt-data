Output State: **`last` is a list with one more element, which is the same as its last element.**

Explanation: The code `last.append(last[-1])` appends the last element of the list `last` to itself. Since the value of `last` was such that it had one element at the end of the previous iteration (which was `last[-1]`), appending this element to the list results in the list having one more element, which is the same as the previous last element.
