Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` remains unchanged, `inx` is `inx2`, `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`, `ans[4]` is 2 - `inx`.**

Explanation: The code `inx = inx2` simply assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `x`, and `ans[4]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
