Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans[2]` is 1, `inx` is `last[1]`, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `inx = inx2` assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. Since `inx2` was equal to `last[1]`, `inx` now also holds the value of `last[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
