Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. This means the variables `i` and `a` are relevant to the loop head.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`.
   - `i` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `left` is a list with its last element increased by the second element of the list `a` plus the last element of `left`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of the list `a`, the loop will continue if there is a third element in the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the third element of the list `a`.
   - The list `a` must have at least three elements for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we need to update the state accordingly:

- `last` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.
- `i` should now be the third element of the list `a`.
- `left` should be updated based on the new value of `i`. Specifically, the last element of `left` should be increased by the third element of `a` plus the last element of `left`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `left` is a list with its last element increased by the third element of the list `a` plus the last element of `left`**.
