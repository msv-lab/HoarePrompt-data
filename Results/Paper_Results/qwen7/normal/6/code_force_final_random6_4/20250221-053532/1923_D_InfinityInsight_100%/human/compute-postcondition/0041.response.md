Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `inx` is less than `inx2`, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `inx = inx2` assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. Since `inx2` is less than `inx` initially, `inx` now holds the same value as `inx2`, which is less than its original value. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
