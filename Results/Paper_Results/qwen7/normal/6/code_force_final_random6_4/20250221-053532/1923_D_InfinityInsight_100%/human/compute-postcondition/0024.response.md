Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the list `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`.
   - `i` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `left` is a list with its last element increased by `i`.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - For each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current element from the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of the list `a` at the start of the loop, after the first iteration, `i` will take the value of the second element of the list `a`.
   - The list `last` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The list `left` will have its last element increased by the new value of `i`.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `last` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop.
- `i` will be the second element of the list `a`.
- `left` will have its last element increased by the second element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`last` is a list containing the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`, `i` is the second element of the list `a`, `left` is a list with its last element increased by the second element of the list `a`**.
