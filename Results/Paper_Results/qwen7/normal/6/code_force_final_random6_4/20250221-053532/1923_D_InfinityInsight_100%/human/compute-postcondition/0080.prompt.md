Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `last` contains the indices of the first occurrence of each unique element in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the last element of the list `a`. The list `left` will have its last element increased by the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

In more detail, the list `last` remains unchanged as it only records the first occurrences of unique elements and does not get updated inside the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in the list `a` after the loop completes. The list `left` will have its last element updated to be the sum of all elements in the list `a`, as each iteration adds the current element `i` to the last element of `left`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated such that `ans[1]` is `2 - inx`, `inx` is less than or equal to 0, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans[2]` is 1, `inx` is `last[1]`, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `ans[i]` is 2 - `inx`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4; `a` remains unchanged; `inx` is either `inx2` or `inx`; `x` is `left[4] - a[4] - 1`; `ans[4]` is 1 - `inx`; if `inx < 0`, then `inx` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
