Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` remains unchanged, `ans[2]` is 1, `inx` is `last[1]`, `inx2` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `ans[i]` is 2 - `inx`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `i + 1` becomes 3. Therefore, `ans[3]` (since `i` is now 3) is set to `3 - inx`. Since `inx` is `last[1]`, `ans[3]` is `3 - last[1]`. However, the problem statement mentions that `ans[2]` is 1, which is not affected by this line of code. All other variables remain unchanged.
