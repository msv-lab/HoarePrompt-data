Output State: The loop has executed for all test cases provided in the input. For each test case, `n` is an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5 (inclusive) and is even. `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string for that test case, and `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string for that test case to a string. After processing all test cases, for each test case, if the second last character of the input string (index `n-2`) is not equal to '<', the output prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The loop does not modify the lists `a` and `b` further once they are created from the input strings, and it only checks the condition on `b[n-2]` during the first iteration of the loop for each test case.

In summary, after all iterations, we have processed all test cases, printed 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition, and the lists `a` and `b` retain their state as created from the respective input strings for each test case.
