Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic checks only the second-to-last column's direction in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) and prints 'No' if the arrow is to the left ('<'), which is incorrect.
2. The problem requires determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows in both rows. The provided solution only checks one specific condition and does not account for the robot's movement through the entire grid.
3. The solution should check if the robot can move from the starting cell (1, 1) to the target cell (2, n) by considering the directions of the arrows in both rows and ensuring the robot can navigate through the grid correctly.

Correctness: **False**
