Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string.
- `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string.
- The second last character of the input string (index `n-2`) is not equal to '<'.

The `print('Yes')` statement simply prints the string 'Yes'. Since no other variables or objects are being referenced in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Yes**
