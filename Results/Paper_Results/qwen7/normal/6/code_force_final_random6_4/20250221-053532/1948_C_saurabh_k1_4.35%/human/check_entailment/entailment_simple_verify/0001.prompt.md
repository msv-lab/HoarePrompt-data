You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed for all test cases provided. For each test case, `n` will be an integer between 2 and 2⋅10^5 (inclusive) and is even. `a` will be a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string for that test case, and `b` will be a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string for that test case to a string. After processing all test cases, if for any test case `b[n-2]` is not equal to '<', the loop will have printed 'Yes' for that test case; otherwise, it will have printed 'No'. The final state will reflect the outcome of running the loop for all test cases, with `n`, `a`, and `b` updated according to the inputs of each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in the grid.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the arrows for both rows.
   - It then checks if the last but one column's arrow in the second row is pointing left (`<`). If it does, it prints 'No', otherwise it prints 'Yes'.
   
3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - The program only checks the last but one column of the second row. This is insufficient because the robot needs to navigate through the entire grid, not just check one specific column.
   - The logic assumes that if the second-to-last column in the second row has an arrow pointing left, the robot cannot reach the last column. However, this is not always true. The robot could potentially navigate around the grid using the arrows in other columns.
   - The program does not consider the movements in the first row or the interactions between the arrows in the two rows.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     4
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
   - According to the given program, since the second-to-last column in the second row has an arrow pointing left, it would print 'No'. However, the correct path would be: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4).
   - This shows that the program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the robot's movement through the entire grid and only checks one specific condition.

**Correctness: **False**
