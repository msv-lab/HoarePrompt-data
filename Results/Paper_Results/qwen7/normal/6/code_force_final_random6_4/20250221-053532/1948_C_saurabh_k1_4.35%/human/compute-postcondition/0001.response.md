Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user within the range of 1 to 10^4 and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case is not specified beyond the constraint that the input must be an integer within the given range.
