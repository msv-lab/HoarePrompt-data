Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive); `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string; `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes an input string, converts each character of the string to a string type using the `map` function, and then converts the map object to a list. The length of the list `b` will be equal to the length of the input string, which is between 1 and 10^4 characters. The original list `a` remains unchanged, and the new list `b` contains the string representations of the characters from the input string.
