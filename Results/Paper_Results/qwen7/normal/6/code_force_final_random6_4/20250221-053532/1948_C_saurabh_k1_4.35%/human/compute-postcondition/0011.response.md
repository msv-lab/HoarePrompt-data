Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Current State**: The current state at the end of the previous iteration includes:
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
   - `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string.
   - `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string.
   - The condition regarding the second last character of the input string (index `n-2`) being equal to '<' is already checked and handled within the loop body.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since this is a new iteration, the user will provide another input value.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- The value of `int(input())` will be read again, and it must be a positive integer to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string, `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string, and the next input must be a positive integer.**
