Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only the second-to-last character of the second row (`b[n - 2]`) to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). This is insufficient because the robot's movement depends on the sequence of arrows in both rows, not just a single character.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
In this case, the program would incorrectly output "Yes" because it only checks `b[3]` (which is `<`), but the correct path is:
- Start at (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).

The program fails to account for the sequence of arrows in both rows, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
