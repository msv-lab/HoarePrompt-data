Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input string.
- `b` is a list of strings created by converting each character of the input string to a string.
- `b` is updated to be the result of `map(str, input())`.

The `print('Yes')` statement will simply print the string 'Yes'.

Output: **Yes**
