You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `i` will be the last character of the original string `s` after all iterations, `s` will be an empty string, `a` will be a set containing all unique characters from the original string `s` for each iteration, and `newstr` will be either the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s.strip()` with the first half of `s.strip()` if the length of `a` is greater than 1, or it will be the original string `s.strip()` if `newstr` is equal to `s.strip()`, or it will be an empty string if the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It also correctly reads the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Creating a Set of Characters:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s`. This set will contain unique characters in the string `s`.
   - If the size of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string `s`.

3. **Generating New String `r`:**
   - The program checks if the string can be rearranged to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`.
   - It attempts to generate a new string `r` by splitting the string `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order (`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`).
   - If this does not work, it tries the reverse of the entire string (`s[::-1]`).
   - If neither of these methods works, it outputs "NO".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all characters in the string `s` are the same (i.e., the set `a` has only one element). In this case, it correctly outputs "NO" because no rearrangement can produce a different string.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the string length is odd. For an odd-length string, the split into two halves will result in one half being longer than the other, which might not be a valid rearrangement.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - Let's test the program with some examples:
     - For `s = "codeforces"`: The set `a` has more than one element, so it should output "YES". The program generates `r = "forcodesec"`, which is correct.
     - For `s = "aaaaa"`: The set `a` has only one element, so it should output "NO". The program correctly outputs "NO".
     - For `s = "xxxxy"`: The set `a` has more than one element, so it should output "YES". The program generates `r = "xxyxx"`, which is correct.
     - For `s = "co"`: The set `a` has more than one element, so it should output "YES". The program generates `r = "oc"`, which is correct.
     - For `s = "d"`: The set `a` has only one element, so it should output "NO". The program correctly outputs "NO".
     - For `s = "nutdealer"`: The set `a` has more than one element, so it should output "YES". The program generates `r = "undertale"`, which is correct.
     - For `s = "mwistht"`: The set `a` has more than one element, so it should output "YES". The program generates `r = "thtsiwm"`, which is correct.
     - For `s = "hhhhhhhhhh"`: The set `a` has only one element, so it should output "NO". The program correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where the string can be rearranged and where it cannot. However, the logic for generating the new string `r` for odd-length strings might not always produce a valid rearrangement. Specifically, the program might not handle the case where the string length is odd correctly.

Given the edge cases and the examples provided, the program seems to have some issues with odd-length strings. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
