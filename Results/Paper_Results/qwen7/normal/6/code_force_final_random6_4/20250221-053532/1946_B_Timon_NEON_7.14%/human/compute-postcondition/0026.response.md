Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_sum` is -1, if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. Since `max_segment` was initially `[0, 0]`, after adding `arr[i]`, `max_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]`. The other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
