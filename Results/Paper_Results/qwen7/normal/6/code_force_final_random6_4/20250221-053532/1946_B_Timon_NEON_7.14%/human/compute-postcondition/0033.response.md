Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `segments_variants`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, or the increment of `i`. Therefore, the only change is that `new_segment` is now an empty list.
