Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `segments_variants`. Therefore, the only variable involved in the loop head is `segment`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `segment`**: Since `segments_variants` includes a new variant which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and the end index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`), the initial value of `segment` will be this new variant.

3. **Initial Values of Other Variables**:
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far.
   - `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated.
   - `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must contain at least one element (the new variant). This ensures that there is something to iterate over.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `segments_variants` must contain at least one element (the new variant).
- `segment` will be initialized to the new variant.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`segments_variants` must include at least one element (the new variant), `segment` is the new variant, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far, `max_sum` remains -1, `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`**.
