Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing `max_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, and a non-empty list with its first element as `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, `i` is incremented by 1.**

This means that `segments_variants` now includes the updated `max_segment + [i - 1]`. The states of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i` have been updated according to their conditions, and `segments_variants` reflects these changes.
