Postcondition: `segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if the first element of `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`, otherwise `max_segment` remains unchanged, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is unchanged unless the first element of the new `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`.
