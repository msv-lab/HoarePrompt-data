Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1**

Explanation: The code assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`. The value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, so `new_segment` is updated accordingly. The other variables (`segments_variants`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
