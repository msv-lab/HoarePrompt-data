Output State: `segments_variants` is a list of all valid segment variants found during the loop execution, where each variant is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment. `new_segment` is an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new segment with a higher sum is found. `max_segment` contains the sum and the end index of the segment with the maximum sum found throughout the loop execution. `max_sum` remains -1 because the loop does not update it. The value of `i` will be equal to the length of `arr` after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments (defined by their sum and end index) that were found during the loop, `new_segment` will be empty, `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum, and `max_sum` will still be -1 since it's not updated in the provided code.
