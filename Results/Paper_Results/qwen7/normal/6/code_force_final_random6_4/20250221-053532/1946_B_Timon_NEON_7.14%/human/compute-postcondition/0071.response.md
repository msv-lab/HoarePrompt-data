Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for segment in segments_variants:`. The key variables here are `segment` and `segments_variants`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `segments_variants`. Once `segments_variants` is exhausted, the loop terminates.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `segments_variants` must include at least one element (the new variant).
   - `segment` is the new variant.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far.
   - `max_sum` remains -1.
   - `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if the first element of `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `segment` is the new variant from the previous iteration, it will be used as the current value of `segment` in the next iteration.
   - `segments_variants` will lose one element because the new variant has been processed. Therefore, `segments_variants` must now include at least one fewer element than before.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before.
   - `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`.
   - `new_segment` remains an empty list.
   - `max_segment` remains the same as it was not updated in the previous iteration.
   - `max_sum` remains -1.
   - `total_max_segment` remains unchanged unless the new `segment` has a higher first element than `total_max_segment`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is unchanged unless the first element of the new `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`.**
