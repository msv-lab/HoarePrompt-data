Output State: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i_new - 1]` or `new_segment + [i_new - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is `i_new`.**

Explanation: The code sets `new_segment` to an empty list. This does not affect `segments_variants`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state, except for `new_segment` which is now explicitly an empty list.
