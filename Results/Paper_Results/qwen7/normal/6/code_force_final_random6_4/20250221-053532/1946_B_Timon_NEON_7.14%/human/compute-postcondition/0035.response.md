Output State: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment` and `arr[i] < 0`, or an empty list if `arr[i] >= 0`. `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i] < 0`, and a non-empty list with its first element as `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_sum` remains -1. `arr` has at least one element. `i` is incremented by 1. `max_segment[0]` is incremented by `arr[i]`.**

In more natural language: The `max_segment[0]` value is incremented by `arr[i]`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
