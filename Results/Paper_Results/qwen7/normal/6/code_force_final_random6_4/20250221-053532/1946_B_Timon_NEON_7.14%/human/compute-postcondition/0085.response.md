Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and processes it to find the segment with the highest sum. It iterates through the list, tracking segments and updating the maximum segment found so far. After processing all elements, it returns a list containing either the segment with the highest sum or `[-1]` if no valid segment is found.**
