Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list containing `new_segment + [i - 1]`; `new_segment` is equal to `max_segment`; `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`; `max_sum` remains -1; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `max_segment = new_segment` updates `max_segment` to be exactly the same as `new_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
