Postcondition: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i - 1]` or an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i] < 0` and contains its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i] < 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
