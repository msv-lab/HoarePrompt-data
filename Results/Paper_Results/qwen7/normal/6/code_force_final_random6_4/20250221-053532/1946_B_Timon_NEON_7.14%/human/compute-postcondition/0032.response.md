Postcondition: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` is updated to either an empty list if `arr[i] < 0` or to `max_segment` if `arr[i] >= 0`, `max_segment` is updated to `max_segment + [i - 1]` with its first element incremented by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < 0`, and remains `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
