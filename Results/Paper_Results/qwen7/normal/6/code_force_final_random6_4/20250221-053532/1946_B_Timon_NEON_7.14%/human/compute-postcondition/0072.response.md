Output State: **`segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is now equal to `segment`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is unchanged unless the first element of the new `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`.**

Explanation: The code `total_max_segment = segment` assigns the current `segment` to `total_max_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before is still valid. The `segment` variable will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, and `new_segment` remains an empty list. The value of `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. The value of `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` will only change if the first element of the new `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`.
