Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list containing either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] if the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`, or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] if the first element of `max_segment` is not greater than the first element of `new_segment`. `new_segment` remains a non-empty list, `max_segment` is updated to either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment`, `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` has at least one element, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.
