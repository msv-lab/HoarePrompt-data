Output State: **`segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. Since `segment` was the next variant from `segments_variants`, `total_max_segment` now holds the same value as `segment`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
