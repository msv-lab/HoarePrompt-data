Output State: **`segments_variants` now includes a new variant which is the concatenation of `new_segment` and the end index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`); `new_segment` remains an empty list; `max_segment` holds the segment with the highest sum found so far; `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated; `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`.**

This means that `total_max_segment` has been explicitly set to `[-1]`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
