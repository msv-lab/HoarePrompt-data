Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is the variable `segment` which is being iterated over from `segments_variants`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `segments_variants`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - `segments_variants`: Since the loop removes one element per iteration (as per the postcondition), `segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before.
   - `segment`: This will be the next variant from `segments_variants` after the current iteration.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `new_segment`: Remains an empty list since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `max_segment`: Remains unchanged unless the first element of the new `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`.
   - `max_sum`: Remains -1 since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `total_max_segment`: Remains unchanged unless the first element of the new `segment` is greater than the first element of `total_max_segment`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before.
- `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`segments_variants` must include at least one fewer element than before, `segment` will be the next variant from `segments_variants`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged, `max_sum` remains -1, and `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**
