Output State: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `segment` does not exist because there are no elements left in `segments_variants`, `new_segment` remains an empty list, `max_segment` remains unchanged as it holds the segment with the highest sum found so far during the loop's execution, `max_sum` remains -1 since it was not updated after the last iteration, and `total_max_segment` remains unchanged and still holds the segment with the highest sum found throughout the loop's iterations.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `segments_variants` is empty because all its elements have been processed. The variables `segment`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment` retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.
