Output State: **`segments_variants` is either a list containing `max_segment + [i_new - 1]` or `new_segment + [i_new - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], i_new]` if `arr[i_new] >= 0` or `[max_segment[0] + arr[i_new], max_segment[1]]` if `arr[i_new] < 0`, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is `i_new`; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

This means that the value of `max_segment[0]` has been increased by the value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
