Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The absolute difference `k` is not a power of 2, and either `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is not even.
