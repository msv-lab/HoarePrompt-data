Postcondition: **`k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `i` is `i_end + 2`. If `k` is a power of 2, `q` remains as 2. If `k` is not a power of 2, `q` is set to \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**
