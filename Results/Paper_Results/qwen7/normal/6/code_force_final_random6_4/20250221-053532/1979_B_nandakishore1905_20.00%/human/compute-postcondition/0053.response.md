Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each iteration \(i\) from 0 to \(t-1\), the following conditions hold:

- `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input for the \(i\)-th iteration.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is the length of `l`.
- `q` is calculated based on whether `k` is a power of 2:
  - If `k` is a power of 2, then `q` is 2.
  - Otherwise, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- `i` is the current iteration index, which will be \(t-1\) after all iterations.

The loop processes each of the `t` test cases, updating `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` according to the conditions specified in the loop body. The final state after all iterations will reflect the last values of these variables for the last test case processed.
