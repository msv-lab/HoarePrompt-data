Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user and `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer within the specified range, the condition for `t` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are set to the integers entered by the user, which are also constrained to be within the range \(1 \leq \text{input()} \leq 10^4\).
