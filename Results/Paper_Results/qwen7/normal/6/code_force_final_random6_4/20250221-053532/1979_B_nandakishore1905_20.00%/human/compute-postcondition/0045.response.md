Output State: **`k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, and `l` is updated to be the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` updates the value of `l` to be the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. All other variables remain unchanged.
