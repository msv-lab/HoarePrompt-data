Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. For each test case, it takes two distinct non-negative integers x and y within the range 0 to 10^9, and returns a value based on some unspecified logic.**

Note: The specific logic for processing x and y is not provided in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameter constraints and the nature of the function's operation without detailing the internal logic.
