Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between the original `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `i` is `i_end + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `q` to \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Here, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
