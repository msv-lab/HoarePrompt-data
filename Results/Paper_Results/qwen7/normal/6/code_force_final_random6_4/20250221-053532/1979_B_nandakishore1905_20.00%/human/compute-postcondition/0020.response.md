Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is either 0 (if `n` is 0 and `m` is even) or the first integer entered by the user, `m` is either an even integer entered by the user (if `n` is 0 and `m` is even) or the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between the original `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.**
