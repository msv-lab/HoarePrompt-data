Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as `2 ** (p - 1)`, where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. `q` is now set to `2 ** (p - 1)`, which is a specific calculation based on the length of the binary representation of `k`.
