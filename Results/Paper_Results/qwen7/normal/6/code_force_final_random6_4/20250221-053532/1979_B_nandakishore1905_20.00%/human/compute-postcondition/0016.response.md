Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function, which prefixes the binary string with '0b'. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes this prefix, leaving only the binary digits of `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
