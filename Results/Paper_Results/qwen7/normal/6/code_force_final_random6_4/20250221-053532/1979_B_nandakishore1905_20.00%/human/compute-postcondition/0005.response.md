Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is also a power of 2, meaning `k & k - 1 == 0`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is a power of 2.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m, and k is a power of 2)**
