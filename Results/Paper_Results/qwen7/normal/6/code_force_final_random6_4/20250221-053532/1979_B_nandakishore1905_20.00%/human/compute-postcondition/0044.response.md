Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is the length of `l`.
- `q` is 2 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- `i` is `i_end + 2`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer 2, regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **2**
