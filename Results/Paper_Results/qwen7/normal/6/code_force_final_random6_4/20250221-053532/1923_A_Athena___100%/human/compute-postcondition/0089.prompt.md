Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from which all leading zeros have been removed, `i` is equal to the length of the updated `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the beginning of the list `a` as long as the first element is zero. After the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will contain no leading zeros, and the length of `a` will be the final value of `i`. The other variables (`res`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `i` is equal to the new length of `a`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `i` must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with its last element and the last element before the pop operation removed, `i` must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
