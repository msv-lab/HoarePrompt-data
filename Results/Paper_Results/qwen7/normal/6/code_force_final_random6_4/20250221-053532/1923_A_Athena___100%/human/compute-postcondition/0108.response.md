Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the number of cells, and a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). The function returns the count of test cases where at least one cell contains a chip.**
