Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is 2
   - `_` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a list containing at least one element
   - The current value of `a[1]` is 0

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, if the loop is to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged as no modifications to it are mentioned in the loop head.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `res` and `_` remain unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given that `a` is a list containing at least one element and `a[1]` is 0, and assuming `i` was 1 (since `a[1]` is being referenced), after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will be 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`res` is 2, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[2]` is 0.**
