Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program does not account for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it simply counts the number of consecutive zeros at the end of the list, which does not reflect the actual minimum operations needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The expected output is `1`, because moving the chip in the 7th position to the 5th position achieves the goal. However, the program incorrectly outputs `2` because it only counts the trailing zeros without considering the optimal moves.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left and keep track of the minimum operations required.
