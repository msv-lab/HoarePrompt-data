Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `t` is equal to the input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 remains valid, and now `t` is specifically set to the input integer. The value of `n` and the list of integers representing the cells have not been read yet, so they remain as part of the precondition.
