Output State: **`res` remains 0, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer, `a` is a list with its last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the precondition states that the last element of `a` must be 0, after executing `a.pop()`, the last element is removed, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
