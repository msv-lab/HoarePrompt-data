Output: **0**

Explanation: 
- `res` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `a` is a list containing only non-zero integers, but this information is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `i` is equal to the length of `a`, but again, this information is not required to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `res`, which is 0.
