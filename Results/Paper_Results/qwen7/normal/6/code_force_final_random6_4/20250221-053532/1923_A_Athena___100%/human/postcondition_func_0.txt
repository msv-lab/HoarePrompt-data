The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (number of cells), and a list of \( n \) integers indicating the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). It then removes leading and trailing zeros from the list, counts the remaining zeros, and prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total count of zeros across all test cases.
