Output State: **res is a non-negative integer, _ is 0, n is the original input integer, a is an empty list.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have been executed, the list `a` will be completely emptied of all its elements. This occurs because the loop removes the first element that is 0 from the list `a` on each iteration. Once all 0s are removed and the list becomes empty, the loop terminates. The variable `res` counts the number of 0s encountered during the loop's execution, so its final value will be equal to the total number of 0s originally present in the list `a`. The variables `res` and `_` do not change outside the loop, and `n` remains the original input integer as it is not referenced in the loop.
