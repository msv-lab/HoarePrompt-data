Postcondition: `res` is 3, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[2]` is 0. If `a[i]` equals 0, then `res` remains 3, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list containing at least one element, and the current value of `a[2]` is 0. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the value of `a[i]`.
