You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `res` will hold the total count of zeros in the final list `a` after all iterations. `_` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed `t` iterations. `n` will still be the original input integer, and `a` will be an empty list if all elements were removed during the iterations or a list of non-zero integers otherwise. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the final list `a`.
    #
    #This means that `res` will contain the cumulative count of zeros found in `a` across all iterations, and the list `a` will be processed to remove leading and trailing zeros, leaving only non-zero elements or an empty list if all elements were zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the number of cells, and a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). The function returns the count of test cases where at least one cell contains a chip.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
