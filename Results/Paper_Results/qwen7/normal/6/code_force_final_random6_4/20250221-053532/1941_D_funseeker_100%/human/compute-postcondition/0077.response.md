Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `q` and `ans`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `ans` and `q` is an element of `ans`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is not an empty set.
   - `q` is the first element in `ans`.
   - `temp` is a set containing either one element `(q + r) % n` or two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
   - `r` is an integer.
   - `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`, and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `ans` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since `q` is the first element in `ans` at the start of the current iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the second element in `ans` (assuming `ans` contains more than one element).
   - The values of `temp`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ans` must still be a non-empty set, but now it should have at least two elements.
   - `q` will be the second element in `ans`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing either one element `(q + r) % n` or two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`, and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'**.
