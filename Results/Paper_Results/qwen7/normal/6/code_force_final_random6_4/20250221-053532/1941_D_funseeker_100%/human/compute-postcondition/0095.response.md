Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws except 0, and now includes the position `n`; `temp` is equal to `ans` after the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code `ans.add(n)` adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Since `ans` originally contains all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws except 0, and now includes the new position `n`, the updated state of `ans` includes all these positions plus `n`. The variable `temp` remains unchanged and is still equal to `ans` after the last iteration of the loop.
