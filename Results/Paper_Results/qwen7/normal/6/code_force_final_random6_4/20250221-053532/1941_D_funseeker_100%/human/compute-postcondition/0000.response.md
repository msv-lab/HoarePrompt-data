Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`. However, the specific values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`**.

This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are now the specific integers returned by the function `func_3()`, while `ans` remains a set initialized with the player `x`.
