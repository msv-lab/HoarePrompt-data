Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element; `temp` contains an element which is `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `ans` was already stated to contain at least one element before the code execution, and no changes were made to `ans`, it still contains at least one element. The value of `temp` now includes the newly added element `(q - r) % n`.
