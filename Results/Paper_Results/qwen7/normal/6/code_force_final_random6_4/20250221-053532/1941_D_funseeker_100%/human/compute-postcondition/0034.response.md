Output State: **`ans` contains all elements it was initialized with, `temp` is equal to `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `r` is now an integer value converted from the original string `r`, and `c` is a string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. All other variables (`ans`, `temp`, `c`, and `r`) are updated or remain as described in the initial state. The value of `r` is specifically converted to an integer based on its original string value.
