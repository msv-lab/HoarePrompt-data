Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, `temp` is an empty set, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is not an empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing either one element `(q + r) % n` or two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`, and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q - r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
