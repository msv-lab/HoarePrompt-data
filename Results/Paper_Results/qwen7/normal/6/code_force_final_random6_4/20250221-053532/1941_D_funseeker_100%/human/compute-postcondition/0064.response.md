Output State: **`ans` is equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, `temp` contains three elements which are (`q - r`) % `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is a string, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`**

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the result of `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c`. However, the initial values of `ans`, `temp`, `m`, and the function `func_1()` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, `ans` remains equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, `temp` still contains three elements which are (`q - r`) % `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `r` and `c` are now strings resulting from the split operation.
