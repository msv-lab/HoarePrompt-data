Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after \(m\) throws. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to handle reading a line, reading an integer, and reading space-separated integers respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`. If the direction is known (`'0'` for clockwise or `'1'` for counterclockwise), it updates the set accordingly. If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), it considers both possible directions.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Index**: After processing all throws, it adjusts for the case where the player index might wrap around to zero by adding `n` to the player index.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

The logic handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
