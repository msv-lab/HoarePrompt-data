Output State: **`first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the `break` statement is executed, causing the program to exit the loop or conditional block. The values of `first`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
