Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
