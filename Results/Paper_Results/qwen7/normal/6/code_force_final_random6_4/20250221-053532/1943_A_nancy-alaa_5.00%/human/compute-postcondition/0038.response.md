Postcondition: `first` is True, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged if the condition `i not in mpp.keys()` is true.
