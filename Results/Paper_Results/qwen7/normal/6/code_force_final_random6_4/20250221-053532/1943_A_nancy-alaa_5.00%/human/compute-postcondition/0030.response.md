Postcondition: `first` is True, `i` is 1, and if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is not met, the postcondition remains as `first` is True, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
