Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `first` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and if the current value of `i` is such that `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` will be set to True. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1, the value of `first` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `first` is True and `i` is 1, whether `mpp[i]` equals 1 or not, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `first` is True, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, then the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i] == 1`, then the values of `first`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
