Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is `n-2`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that contains the count of each element in `arr`.
- `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.
- The condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is `True`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the execution of the `print(i)` statement:

1. The condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is evaluated. Since `first` is `False`, the entire condition evaluates to `False`.
2. Because the condition is `False`, the line `print(i)` would not be executed under these conditions.

However, since the question asks us to determine what will be printed and the condition is not met, the print statement will not execute, and thus nothing will be printed.

Output: **None**
