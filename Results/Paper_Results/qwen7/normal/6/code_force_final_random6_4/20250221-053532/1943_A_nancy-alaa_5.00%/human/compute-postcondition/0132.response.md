Output State: **`first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement where `i` is being checked against the keys of `mpp`. The values of `first` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition for breaking out of the loop is met.
