Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's final score according to the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where Alice and Bob make their moves optimally. However, the current implementation does not simulate the game properly. Instead, it tries to find the smallest missing integer or the smallest integer with a count of 1 after the first unique element in the array `arr`.

2. **Game Logic Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem. Specifically, Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to `c`, and delete it from `a`, whereas Bob can only pick and delete an element from `a`. This logic is crucial for determining the optimal moves and the final state of `c`.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The current implementation prints values based on the first unique element and its count, which is not related to the MEX of the array `c` formed by Alice's optimal moves.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
