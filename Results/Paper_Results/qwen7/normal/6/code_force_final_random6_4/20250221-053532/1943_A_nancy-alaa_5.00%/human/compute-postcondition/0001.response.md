Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state only mentions that `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
