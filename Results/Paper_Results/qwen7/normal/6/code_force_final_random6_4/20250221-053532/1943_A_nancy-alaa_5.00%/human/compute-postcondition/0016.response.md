Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and if `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is False, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
