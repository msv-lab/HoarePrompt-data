Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, `n` is assigned the value of int(input()), and `arr` is updated to be a list of integers based on the new input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, updating the list `arr`. The other variables (`first`, `i`, `n`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
