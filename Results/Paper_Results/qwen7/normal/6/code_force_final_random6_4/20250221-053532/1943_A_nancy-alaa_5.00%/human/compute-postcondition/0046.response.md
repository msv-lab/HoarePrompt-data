Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented to `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `first` remains `True` as it was set to `True` during the first iteration when `mpp[0] == 1`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
