Based on the initial state described:

- `first` remains `False`, meaning it was likely initialized as `False` and has not been changed.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` before this increment is not specified.
- `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, but the specific values of `arr` are not provided.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`.
- If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Given these conditions, the value of `i` after being incremented by 1 will be printed. Since the exact value of `i` before the increment is not specified, we can only refer to it as `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the value of i after being incremented by 1)**
