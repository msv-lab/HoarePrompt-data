Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains False: This variable's value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is `n-1`: Here, `n` is the length of the list `arr`. Since `i` is set to `n-1`, it means `i` holds the value of the last index of the list `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers: This list is not explicitly defined with specific values, but we know its length is `n`.
- `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`: This variable is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `i`.

Output: **n-1**
