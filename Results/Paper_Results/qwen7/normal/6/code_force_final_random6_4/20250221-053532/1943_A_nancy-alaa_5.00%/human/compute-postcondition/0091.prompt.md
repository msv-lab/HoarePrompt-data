Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `first` is False, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, `n` is the integer input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and if `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i] != 1`, no changes occur to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `mpp[i]` equals 1. If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1, no change occurs to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is `i - 1`, `n` remains the same, and `mpp[i]` does not equal 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` becomes True, `i` is decremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `mpp[i]` does not equal 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
