Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` equals 2.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(min(a))`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `n` is explicitly given as 2.
2. The variable `a` is described as a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. Since no specific input string is provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `a`. However, we know that `a` is a list of integers.
3. The `min(a)` function will return the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Since the exact content of `a` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **min(a) (where min(a) is the smallest integer in the list a)**
