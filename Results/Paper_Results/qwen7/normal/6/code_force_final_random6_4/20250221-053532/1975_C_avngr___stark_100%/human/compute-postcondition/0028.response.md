Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `max` remains unchanged, `temp` is a slice of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 2`, and if `temp[1] > max` before sorting, then `temp` is sorted with `max` remaining unchanged; otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.
