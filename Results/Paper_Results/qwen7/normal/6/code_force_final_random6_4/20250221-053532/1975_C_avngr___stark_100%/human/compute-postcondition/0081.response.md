Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is `temp[1]`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 and contains three consecutive elements which are now sorted, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `max = temp[1]` updates the value of `max` to be equal to `temp[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, since the code increments the index `i` implicitly by moving to the next element in the list (as `temp` starts from index 2), `i` is updated to 3.
