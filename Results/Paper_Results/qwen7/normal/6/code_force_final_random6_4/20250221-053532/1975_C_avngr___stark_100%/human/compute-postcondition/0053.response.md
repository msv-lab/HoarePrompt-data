Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing three consecutive elements starting from index `i + 1`, `temp` is now sorted, and `max` is now equal to `temp[1]`.
