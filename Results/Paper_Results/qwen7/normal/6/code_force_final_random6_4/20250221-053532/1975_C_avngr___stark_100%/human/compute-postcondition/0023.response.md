Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `max` is equal to `temp[1]` after sorting, `temp` is a slice of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 3` after sorting, and if `temp[1] > max` before sorting, then `max` remains unchanged after sorting; otherwise, `max` remains as it was before sorting.
