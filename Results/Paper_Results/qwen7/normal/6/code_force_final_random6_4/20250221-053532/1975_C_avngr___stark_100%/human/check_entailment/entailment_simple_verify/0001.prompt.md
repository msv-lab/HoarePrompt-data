You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is exactly 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers converted from input, `max` is the maximum of the second smallest values (i.e., the second element) of all possible sublists of three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `temp` is a sublist of `a` containing the last three elements of `a` which are sorted, `i` is `n-2`.
    #
    #In this final state, `t` will be exactly 3 since the loop runs `t` times, and `t` is initialized to 3. `n` remains the same as it was provided as input and not modified within the loop. The list `a` remains intact but is processed through the loop. The variable `max` will hold the highest value among the second smallest values of all possible sublists of three consecutive elements in the list `a`. The variable `temp` will contain the last three elements of `a` after the loop has completed, and these elements will be sorted. The variable `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs from `range(n-2)`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Handling Single Element Arrays:**
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints the minimum of the two elements and continues to the next test case. This is a correct approach because the median of any two distinct numbers is the middle one, and applying the operation will make both elements equal to the smaller one.

3. **Finding the Maximum Median:**
   - The program initializes `max` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the array with a loop from `i = 0` to `n - 2`.
   - For each `i`, it considers the subarray `temp = a[i:i + 3]`.
   - It sorts `temp` and checks if the second element (`temp[1]`) is greater than the current `max`. If so, it updates `max`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays:**
   - The program only considers subarrays of length 3 (`a[i:i + 3]`). However, according to the problem statement, Mocha can choose any subarray `[a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]` where `1 ≤ l < r ≤ n`.
   - By limiting the subarray to length 3, the program may miss out on larger subarrays that could yield a higher median.

2. **Incorrect Logic for General Case:**
   - Even if the subarray length is correctly considered, the logic to find the maximum possible median is flawed. The program only checks the second element of the sorted subarray, which might not always give the correct result.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The median of the entire array is 3, but the program would only check subarrays of length 3, missing the possibility of using the entire array.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, Mocha should consider the entire array as a potential subarray and find the median of the entire array. The median of the entire array is the value that remains after all operations, as Mocha can always reduce the array to a single value by repeatedly applying the median operation.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible subarrays and does not find the true maximum possible median of the entire array.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
