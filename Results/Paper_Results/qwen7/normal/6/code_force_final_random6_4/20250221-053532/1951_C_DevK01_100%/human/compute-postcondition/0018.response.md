Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is the length of `N` after the code execution.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `cost` by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.
- `sum(N)` is the sum of the elements in the list `N`.
- `((n - 1) * n // 2)` calculates the number of pairs in the first `n-1` elements.
- `n * m * mu` adds the product of `n`, `m`, and `mu` to `cost`.
- `n` is updated to the new length of `N` after the addition.
