Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is not the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `cost` as `mu * w`. Here, `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `w` is the last element of `N` before popping. Since `N` contains the first `q` elements of `M`, and `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `w` is the last element of `N`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
