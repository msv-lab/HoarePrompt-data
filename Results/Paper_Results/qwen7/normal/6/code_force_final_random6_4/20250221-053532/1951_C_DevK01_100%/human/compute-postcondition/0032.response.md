Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `M` is sorted, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

In this output state, the variable `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
