You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Example

Output

    10
    64

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs to process. The variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost` will be undefined or reset to their initial states for the last input, but since `t` is now 0, these variables will not be used further. The loop has completed all its iterations, and the program is ready to terminate.
    #
    #In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, meaning no more inputs are left to process. All other variables (`L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `cost`) will either be undefined or will hold the final values from the last input processed before `t` became 0. The program will now terminate as there are no more inputs to handle.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k` along with a list `M` of `n` integers. It then calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving `n`, `m`, and `k`. The cost is determined by sorting `M`, selecting a subset of elements, and performing arithmetic operations. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated cost for each case and terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is greater than the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the cost.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
5 10 15
1 2 3 4 5
```

- `n = 5`, `m = 10`, `k = 15`
- The prices per ticket for each of the upcoming 5 days are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

According to the problem description, since `k` (15) is greater than `n * m` (50), the program should handle this case correctly. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles cases where `k > n * m`. Specifically, it should calculate the cost considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day without exceeding `k`.

Here is a modified version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        print(cost)
        continue

func()
```

This version ensures that the program correctly handles the case where `k` exceeds `n * m` by adjusting the calculation accordingly.
