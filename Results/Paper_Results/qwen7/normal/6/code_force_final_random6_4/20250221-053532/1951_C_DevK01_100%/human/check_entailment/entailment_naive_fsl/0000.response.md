Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is greater than the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the cost.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
5 10 15
1 2 3 4 5
```

- `n = 5`, `m = 10`, `k = 15`
- The prices per ticket for each of the upcoming 5 days are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

According to the problem description, since `k` (15) is greater than `n * m` (50), the program should handle this case correctly. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles cases where `k > n * m`. Specifically, it should calculate the cost considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day without exceeding `k`.

Here is a modified version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        print(cost)
        continue

func()
```

This version ensures that the program correctly handles the case where `k` exceeds `n * m` by adjusting the calculation accordingly.
