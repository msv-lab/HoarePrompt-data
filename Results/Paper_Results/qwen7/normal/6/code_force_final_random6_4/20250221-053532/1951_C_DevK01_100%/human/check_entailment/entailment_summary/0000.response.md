Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by a list of ticket prices `M`.
2. **Sorting and Selection**: The function sorts the list `M` and selects the first `q` elements where `q = ceil(k / m)`. This step ensures that we consider the most cost-effective days first.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This handles the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought matches the maximum allowed tickets per day times the number of days.
   - If `n * m != k`, the function correctly removes the last element from `N` and calculates the remaining tickets to be bought (`mu`). It then adds the cost of these remaining tickets and adjusts the total cost accordingly.
4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the logic in the function appears to correctly implement the solution for finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
