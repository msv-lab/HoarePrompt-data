To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `L` is a list of integers.
   - `M` is a sorted version of `L`.
   - `n` is the length of `N`, but `N` is not yet defined.
   - `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, where `k` is the third element of `L`.
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.

2. **Calculating `cost`**:
   - If `n * m` equals `k`, then `cost` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{cost} = m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is updated as:
     \[
     \text{cost} = \text{cost} + m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu
     \]

Given these steps, the value of `cost` depends on the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `L`, and the elements of `M`. Since the exact values are not provided, we need to express the `cost` in terms of these variables.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions described above with n, m, k, L, and M as defined)**
