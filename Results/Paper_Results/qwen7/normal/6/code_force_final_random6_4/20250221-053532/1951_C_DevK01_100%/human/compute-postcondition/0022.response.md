The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the initial state, we assume that the `continue` statement is inside a loop. However, the `continue` statement itself does not change any variable values or the state of the variables outside the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
- `L` is a list of integers
- `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`
- `n` is the length of `N`
- `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`
- `k` is the third element of `L`
- `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`
- `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`
- If `n * m` equals `k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
- Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`

After executing the `continue` statement, the loop will proceed to the next iteration without changing the values of any variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `L` is a list of integers, `M` is a sorted list of integers from `L`, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.**
