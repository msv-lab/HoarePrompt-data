Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `L` is a list of integers from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is updated to the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cost` as `mu * w`. Here, `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `w` is the last element of the sublist `N` before popping. The values of `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `w` remain unchanged except for the addition of `cost`, which is now equal to `mu * w`.
