Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `M` is sorted, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the `continue` statement, all the variables retain their previous values, and the loop continues its execution.
