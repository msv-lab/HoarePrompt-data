Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 - 1, `L` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `M` is sorted, `n` is the length of the sublist `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`, `N` is a sublist of the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

This means that the `cost` variable is now assigned the value of `mu * w`, where `mu` is calculated as `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
