State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the `range` function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the given number.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, so `t` must satisfy this condition.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since the loop head only involves `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
