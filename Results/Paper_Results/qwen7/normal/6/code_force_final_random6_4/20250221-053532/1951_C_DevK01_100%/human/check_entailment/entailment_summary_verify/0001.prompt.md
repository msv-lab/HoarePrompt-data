You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k` along with a list `M` of `n` integers. It then calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving `n`, `m`, and `k`. The cost is determined by sorting `M`, selecting a subset of elements, and performing arithmetic operations. After processing all test cases, the function prints the calculated cost for each case and terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - `n`: Number of days.
   - `m`: Maximum tickets that can be purchased per day.
   - `k`: Total number of tickets to be purchased.
   - `M`: List of ticket prices for each day.
   - `m = min(m, k)`: Ensures that `m` is not greater than `k`.

3. **Sorting Prices:**
   - `M.sort()`: Sorts the list of ticket prices in ascending order.

4. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`: Determines the number of days required to purchase `k` tickets if `m` tickets can be bought each day.
   - `N = M[:q]`: Extracts the first `q` elements from the sorted list of prices.
   - `n = len(N)`: Calculates the length of the extracted list `N`.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy `k` tickets without any additional cost increase:
     - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`: Computes the total cost.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost considering the additional increases in ticket prices:
     - `w = N.pop()`: Removes the last element from the list `N` (the highest price).
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`: Calculates the remaining tickets to be bought after purchasing `m` tickets each day for `n-1` days.
     - `cost = mu * w`: Adds the cost of the remaining tickets at the current highest price.
     - `n = len(N)`: Updates the length of the list `N`.
     - `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`: Adds the cost of the previously purchased tickets and the additional cost due to the increase in price.

6. **Output:**
   - Prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification:

Given the logic and the steps, the program seems to correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. It sorts the prices, calculates the necessary number of days to purchase the tickets, and accounts for the increasing prices correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended based on the problem statement.
