Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not account for the fact that each extrovert requires a tent with two others, and it fails to properly allocate tents for the remaining universals after assigning tents to introverts and extroverts.

Let's consider the following test case:
- Input: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`

According to the problem description:
- 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
- 4 extroverts need 2 tents (since 4 is not divisible by 3, we need 2 full tents for 4 extroverts).
- 1 universal can share a tent with the remaining extroverts.

However, the program calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals incorrectly. Hereâ€™s how the program would handle this case:

1. `func_1(4, 1)` is called.
2. Since `4 % 3 == 1`, and `1 + 4 < 3`, it returns `None`.
3. `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1`.

This result is incorrect because it indicates that it is impossible to accommodate the participants, which is not true. We can fit the 4 extroverts into 2 tents and the 1 universal into another tent, making a total of 3 tents.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, leading to an incorrect output.
