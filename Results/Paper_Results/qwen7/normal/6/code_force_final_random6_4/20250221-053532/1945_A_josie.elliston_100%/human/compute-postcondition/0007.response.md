Output State: **The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, where extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `extroverts` is a non-negative integer.
- `universals` is a non-negative integer.
- The condition `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3` holds true.

The code snippet calculates the ceiling value of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. Since both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers, their sum is also a non-negative integer. The ceiling function ensures that if the division results in a non-integer, it rounds up to the nearest integer. 

Since the exact values of `extroverts` and `universals` are not specified, the output is the ceiling of the sum of these two values divided by 3.
