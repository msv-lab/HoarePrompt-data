Output State: **`i` is equal to 'A', `ac` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ac` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was 0 before this line of code). Since `i` is not affected by this line of code, its value remains 'A'. Therefore, the updated state includes `ac` being set to 1.
