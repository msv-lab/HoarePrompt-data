Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A', `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A'**

Explanation: The variable `ac` is incremented by 1. If `i` was 'A' before, `ac` was 1, so now it becomes 2. If `i` was not 'A', `bc` was 1, and it remains unchanged. The value of `i` and the condition for `bc` stay the same as the initial state.
