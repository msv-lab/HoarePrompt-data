Postcondition: `i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is the opposite of its previous value (with a change of 1 in the current case), and `bc` is the opposite of its previous value (with a possible change in the current case). If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bc` is incremented by 1.
