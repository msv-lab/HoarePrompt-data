Postcondition: `ac` is 1 or 2 depending on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`, `bc` is 1 or 2 depending on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`, `q` is `t`, `s` is the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `i` and `i` is the first character of this new string. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 2 and `bc` is 1 or 2 depending on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`. Otherwise, `ac` is 1 or 2 depending on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`, and `bc` is 2 depending on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`.
