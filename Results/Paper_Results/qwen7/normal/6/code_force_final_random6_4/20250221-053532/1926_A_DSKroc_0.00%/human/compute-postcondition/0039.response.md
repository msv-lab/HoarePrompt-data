Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**:
   - `ac` is 2 if the current character `i` is 'A' and the next character in `s` is also 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1.
   - `bc` is 2 if the current character `i` is not 'A' and the next character in `s` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is 1.
   - `q` is `t`.
   - `s` is the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `i`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `i` must be the first character of the remaining string `s`.
   - The value of `ac` and `bc` will depend on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be the first character of the remaining string `s`.
- `ac` and `bc` will be updated based on the new values of `i` and the next character in `s`.

Since we don't know the exact characters in `s` after the removal of the current `i`, we can only say that `s` is now one character shorter and `i` is the first character of this new string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ac` is 1 or 2 depending on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`, `bc` is 1 or 2 depending on the new value of `i` and the next character in `s`, `q` is `t`, `s` is the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `i` and `i` is the first character of this new string.**
