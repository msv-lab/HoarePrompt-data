Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard. Specifically, the program attempts to reduce the size of the board `n` by subtracting 2 for each move where the row and column indices are different and 1 for each move where they are the same. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the number of valid configurations remaining after each move.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- For a 4x4 board with 1 move at (1, 2):
  - The program reduces `n` by 2, resulting in `n = 2`.
  - This is incorrect because after the first move, there are still multiple valid configurations for placing rooks on the remaining positions.

The correct approach involves calculating the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions without violating the constraints. The provided solution uses dynamic programming (`func_1`) but does not correctly update the board size or account for the constraints properly.

A correct implementation would involve maintaining the board state and ensuring that no two rooks attack each other after each move. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results.
