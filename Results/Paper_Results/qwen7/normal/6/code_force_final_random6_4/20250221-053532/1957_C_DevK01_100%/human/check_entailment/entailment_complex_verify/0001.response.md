### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then iterates through the `k` moves, updating `n` based on whether the move was mirrored or not.

2. **Updating `n`:**
   - If the move `(a, b)` is not mirrored (`a != b`), it effectively removes 2 positions from consideration (one for the white rook and one for the black rook).
   - If the move is mirrored (`a == b`), it removes only 1 position since the computer cannot place a rook in the same position.

3. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - After processing all moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board without them attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a DP array `dp` with base cases `[1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, calculating the number of ways to place rooks using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - Finally, it returns `dp[n]`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Input Parsing and Updating `n`
- The program correctly updates `n` based on the moves. If the move is not mirrored, `n` is decreased by 2. If the move is mirrored, `n` is decreased by 1. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

#### Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board without them attacking each other. The recurrence relation used in the function is correct and follows the combinatorial logic for placing non-attacking rooks.

### Verification

- The logic for updating `n` is correct because it accounts for both mirrored and non-mirrored moves accurately.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid configurations for placing rooks on an `n x n` board, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Given that the program correctly processes the input, updates `n` based on the moves, and uses a valid dynamic programming approach to compute the number of configurations, the program appears to be correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
