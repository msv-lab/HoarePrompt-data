You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        if a != b:
            n -= 2
        else:
            n -= 1
    print(func_1(n))
    continue

def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        dp.pop(0)
    return dp[-1]



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` and calculates the last element of a list `dp` based on a specific recurrence relation. The list `dp` is initialized with the first two elements as 1 and 3. For each integer `i` from 2 to `n`, the next element in `dp` is computed using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`. After all iterations, the function returns the last element of the list `dp`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the solution to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then iterates through the `k` moves, updating `n` based on whether the move was mirrored or not.

2. **Updating `n`:**
   - If the move `(a, b)` is not mirrored (`a != b`), it effectively removes 2 positions from consideration (one for the white rook and one for the black rook).
   - If the move is mirrored (`a == b`), it removes only 1 position since the computer cannot place a rook in the same position.

3. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - After processing all moves, the program calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board without them attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a DP array `dp` with base cases `[1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, calculating the number of ways to place rooks using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - Finally, it returns `dp[n]`.

### Verification

- The logic for updating `n` is correct because it accounts for both mirrored and non-mirrored moves accurately.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is designed to count the number of valid configurations for placing rooks on an `n x n` board, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Given that the program correctly processes the input, updates `n` based on the moves, and uses a valid dynamic programming approach to compute the number of configurations, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
