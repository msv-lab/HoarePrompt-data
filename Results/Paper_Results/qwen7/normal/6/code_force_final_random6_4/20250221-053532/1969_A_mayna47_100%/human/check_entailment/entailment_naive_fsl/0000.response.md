Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```

In this case, no friend is the best friend of another friend. According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 2 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the current implementation always prints 2, which is incorrect because sending invitations to only 2 friends cannot guarantee that at least 2 friends will come. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
