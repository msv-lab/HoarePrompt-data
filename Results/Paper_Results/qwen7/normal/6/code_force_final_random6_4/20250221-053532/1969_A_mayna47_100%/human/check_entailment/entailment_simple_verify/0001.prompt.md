You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The function has either printed '2' and returned, or it has iterated through all indices from 1 to `n` without finding any `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. In the latter case, the function returns `None`.
    #
    #In more detail, the loop will continue to iterate over each index `i` from 1 to `n`. If for any `i`, the condition `v[v[i]] == i` is met, the function prints '2' and immediately returns. If no such `i` is found after checking all indices, the function will complete all iterations and return `None`.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop.
   - This suggests there might be a mistake in the main loop where `func_1()` is called without any parameters.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it with the best friend information.
   - It then checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  5
  3 1 2 5 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `n = 5`
  - `v = [0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - Checking pairs: `(3, 4)` and `(4, 3)` are each other's best friends, so it should print `2`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  2 3 4 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `n = 4`
  - `v = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - No pair found, so it should print `3`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `n = 2`
  - `v = [0, 2, 1]`
  - Checking pairs: `(2, 1)` and `(1, 2)` are each other's best friends, so it should print `2`.

### Conclusion

The program logic correctly identifies whether there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` in such cases. If no such pair exists, it prints `3`, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

However, the main issue is that the function `func_1()` is not being called correctly in the main loop. The correct implementation should call `func_1()` with the appropriate arguments.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)
```

### Final Answer

Given the analysis, the original program logic is correct, but it needs to call `func_1()` properly. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**
