### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified the logic of the program and its correctness based on the problem description. However, the main issue pointed out is that the function `func_1()` is not being called correctly in the main loop. The annotated code and the original assessment correctly describe the behavior of the function and the overall logic. The function checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found, otherwise it prints `3`.

Given the corrected program provided in the original assessment, the function `func_1()` is now being called correctly within the main loop. The logic inside `func_1()` is sound and matches the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation

Since the original assessment correctly identified the logic and the need to call `func_1()` properly, and the provided corrected program addresses this issue, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**

The given program, when correctly implemented as described, is indeed correct.
