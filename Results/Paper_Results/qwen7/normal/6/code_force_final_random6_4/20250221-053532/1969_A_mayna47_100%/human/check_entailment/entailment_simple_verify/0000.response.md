### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Initializes an array `v` with zeros of length `n+1`.
   - Reads the list of best friends and updates `v` accordingly.
   - Iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n` and checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition checks if friend `i` and their best friend `v[i]` are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3` and returns.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Case When No Pair of Friends Are Each Other's Best Friends**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - Here, no friend is the best friend of another friend. The program should handle this case correctly.

2. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` for such pairs.
   - If no such pairs exist, it prints `3`, which is the correct answer according to the problem statement.

#### Detailed Verification:
- **Test Case with No Pairs**:
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    4
    1 2 3 4
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    3
    ```
  - Explanation:
    - The program correctly identifies that there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.
    - Hence, it prints `3`, indicating that at least 3 friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

- **Test Case with Valid Pairs**:
  - Input:
    ```
    5
    3 1 2 5 4
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    2
    ```
  - Explanation:
    - The program correctly identifies the pair (4, 5) as each other's best friends.
    - Hence, it prints `2`, indicating that inviting just these two friends is sufficient.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly handles all cases, including the edge case where no pairs of friends are each other's best friends.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because the program does handle the case where no pairs of friends are each other's best friends correctly. The program prints `3` in such cases, which is the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
