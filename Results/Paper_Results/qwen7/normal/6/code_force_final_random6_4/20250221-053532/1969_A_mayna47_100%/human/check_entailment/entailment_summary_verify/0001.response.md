### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the program logic is sound in terms of identifying pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and printing the correct number of invitations. However, the main issue lies in the fact that the function `func_1()` is not being called correctly within the main loop. The original assessment did not address this issue, which is a significant flaw in the program.

The corrected version of the program should call `func_1()` with the appropriate arguments, as shown below:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)
```

This ensures that the function `func_1()` is invoked for each test case, and the program behaves as intended.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original program logic is correct, but it needs to call `func_1()` properly. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the improper calling of `func_1()`.
