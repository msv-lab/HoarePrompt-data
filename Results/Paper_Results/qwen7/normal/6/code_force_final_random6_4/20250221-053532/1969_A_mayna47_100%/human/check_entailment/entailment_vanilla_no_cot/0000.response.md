Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters inside the loop in the main part of the program. The call to `func_1()` should be replaced with the necessary logic to read the input and output the result.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1()` checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns. However, this logic alone is not sufficient to cover all cases where at least 2 friends need to be invited. For example, consider the case `[2, 3, 4, 1]` from the sample input. No single pair of friends are each other's best friends, yet inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 allows at least 2 friends to come.

3. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The program needs to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves more complex logic, including identifying cycles and ensuring that the minimum set of friends are invited.

### Corrected Program:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Create a graph representation
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        graph[i].append(p[i - 1])
        graph[p[i - 1]].append(i)

    # Function to check if a cycle includes a node
    def dfs(node, visited, path):
        visited[node] = True
        path.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                if dfs(neighbor, visited, path):
                    return True
            elif neighbor in path:
                # Cycle detected
                return True
        path.pop()
        return False

    # Find cycles
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    cycles = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            path = []
            if dfs(i, visited, path):
                cycles.append(path)

    # If there is a cycle of length 2 or more, we can invite the nodes in the cycle
    if any(len(cycle) >= 2 for cycle in cycles):
        print(len(min(cycles, key=len)))
    else:
        # Otherwise, we need to invite at least 3 friends
        print(3)
```

This corrected version properly identifies cycles and calculates the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
