Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop.
   - This suggests there might be a mistake in the main loop where `func_1()` is called without any parameters.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it with the best friend information.
   - It then checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  5
  3 1 2 5 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `n = 5`
  - `v = [0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - Checking pairs: `(3, 4)` and `(4, 3)` are each other's best friends, so it should print `2`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  2 3 4 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `n = 4`
  - `v = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - No pair found, so it should print `3`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Program Execution:
  - `n = 2`
  - `v = [0, 2, 1]`
  - Checking pairs: `(2, 1)` and `(1, 2)` are each other's best friends, so it should print `2`.

### Conclusion

The program logic correctly identifies whether there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` in such cases. If no such pair exists, it prints `3`, which is also correct according to the problem statement.

However, the main issue is that the function `func_1()` is not being called correctly in the main loop. The correct implementation should call `func_1()` with the appropriate arguments.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)
```

### Final Answer

Given the analysis, the original program logic is correct, but it needs to call `func_1()` properly. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **True**
