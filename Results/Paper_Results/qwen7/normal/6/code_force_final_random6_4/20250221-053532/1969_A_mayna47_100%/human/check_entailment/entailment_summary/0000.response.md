Reasoning:
1. The program defines a function `func_1()` which processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. It initializes a list `v` with zeros, and updates it to include the indices from the input list `p`.
4. The program then iterates through the list `v` to check if there exists any pair `(i, v[i])` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition would mean that `i` and `v[i]` are best friends and their best friends are also `i` and `v[i]`, respectively.
5. If such a pair is found, the program correctly prints '2' because only two invitations need to be sent (one to `i` and one to `v[i]`).
6. If no such pair is found, the program prints '3'. However, this logic does not cover all scenarios where fewer than three invitations might suffice.

To determine correctness, we need to verify if the logic covers all possible cases and if the output is always the minimum number of invitations required.

Upon closer inspection:
- The logic correctly identifies pairs of friends who are best friends and whose best friends are also each other, requiring only two invitations.
- However, the logic incorrectly assumes that if no such pair is found, exactly three invitations are needed, without considering other possible configurations where fewer than three invitations could suffice.

For instance, consider the following scenario:
- Input: `n = 4`, `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Here, no pair of friends satisfy `v[v[i]] == i`, but we can still invite friends 1 and 2, making the answer 2, not 3.

Thus, the current implementation does not guarantee the minimum number of invitations in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
