Output State: **`ans` is either 2 or 1, `sm` is equal to `k`, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, and since `(ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]])` is true, `ans` is now 2 and `sm` is now `k` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `sm -= 1` decrements the value of `sm` by 1. Given that `sm` was initially either `k` + 1 or greater than or equal to `k`, after decrementing, `sm` will now be equal to `k`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
