You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop will continue to increment `ans` as long as the condition `sm >= k` is met. Once `r` reaches `n-1`, the loop will terminate.
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans` which is incremented as long as `sm >= k` and the loop continues until `r` reaches `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the count (`ans`) of subarrays of `a` (of length at least `m`) where the sum of elements, when compared with the corresponding elements in `b`, meets or exceeds `k`. This is determined by iterating through `a` and maintaining a running sum (`sm`) of overlapping elements from `a` and `b`, adjusting this sum as elements enter and leave the current subarray window.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to count how many subsegments of array `a` of length `m` are "good". A subsegment is considered good if, after sorting, at least `k` elements match the sorted elements of array `b`.

2. **Key Points in the Solution**:
   - The solution uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - It maintains a counter (`ca`) for the current subsegment and updates it as the window slides.
   - It also maintains a counter (`cb`) for the sorted elements of `b`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The initial segment of `a` (first `m` elements) is sorted and counted using `ca`. This is compared with `cb` to see if at least `k` elements match.
   - As the window slides, one element is added and another is removed from the counter `ca`. The counts are updated accordingly.
   - If the number of matching elements (`sm`) is at least `k`, the count of good subsegments (`ans`) is incremented.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the operations within the loop are efficient.
   - The use of counters ensures that the comparison and update operations are done in constant time.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the sliding window and updates the counters efficiently.
   - The conditions for updating the answer (`ans`) are correctly implemented.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
