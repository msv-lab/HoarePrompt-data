Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` correctly initializes counters for both arrays `a` and `b` after sorting them.
2. It calculates the initial overlap `sm` between the first `m` elements of `a` and `b`.
3. The function then iterates through the remaining elements of `a` using a sliding window approach.
4. For each new element added to the window, it checks if there's an increase in the overlap count `sm` and adjusts `sm` accordingly.
5. If `sm` meets or exceeds `k`, it increments the answer counter `ans`.
6. The function correctly handles the removal of the element that is sliding out of the window by decrementing the count and checking if it was part of the initial overlap.
7. The function returns the final count of good subsegments.

Given the logic and the implementation, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
