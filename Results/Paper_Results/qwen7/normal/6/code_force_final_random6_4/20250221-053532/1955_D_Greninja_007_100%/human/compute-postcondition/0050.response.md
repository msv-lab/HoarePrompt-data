Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans` which is incremented as long as `sm >= k` and the loop continues until `r` reaches `n-1`.**

This means that the program returns the final value of `ans` after the loop terminates, having incremented `ans` each time the condition `sm >= k` was true, up until `r` reached `n-1`.
