Postcondition: `ans` is either 2 or 1, `sm` is `k` + 1, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1 from its previous value, and if `(ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]])` is true, then `ans` is 2 and `sm` is `k` + 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 2 and `sm` remains `k`. Additionally, the current value of `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.
