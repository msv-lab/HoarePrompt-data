Output State: **`ans` is 3, `sm` is `k`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, `m` must be less than or equal to `previous_r + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `previous_r + 1`, `ca[a[previous_r + 1]]` is decremented by 1, and if `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then no other changes occur.**

Explanation: The code `ca[a[r - m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `ca[a[r - m]]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the condition provided.
