#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):

    #State: The loop will continue to increment `ans` as long as the condition `sm >= k` is met. Once `r` reaches `n-1`, the loop will terminate.
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans` which is incremented as long as `sm >= k` and the loop continues until `r` reaches `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the count (`ans`) of subarrays of `a` (of length at least `m`) where the sum of elements, when compared with the corresponding elements in `b`, meets or exceeds `k`. This is determined by iterating through `a` and maintaining a running sum (`sm`) of overlapping elements from `a` and `b`, adjusting this sum as elements enter and leave the current subarray window.
