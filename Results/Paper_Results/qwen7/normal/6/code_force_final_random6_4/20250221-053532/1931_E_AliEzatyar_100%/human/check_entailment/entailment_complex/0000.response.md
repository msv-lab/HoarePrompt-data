Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the integer `num`. The logic is sound and the function works as expected.
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and initializes an array to store the results.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the list of integers.
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list and counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using `func_1`.
   - It sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of trailing zeros in pairs, summing up the counts. This step is intended to simulate Anna's moves where she reverses numbers to minimize the impact on the total digit count.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the trailing zeros is at least `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the constraints correctly, including the range of `num` and the number of test cases.
   - The sorting and summing of trailing zeros are done correctly, reflecting the optimal strategy for Anna.
   - The final decision on the winner is made based on the condition derived from the total digits and trailing zeros, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
