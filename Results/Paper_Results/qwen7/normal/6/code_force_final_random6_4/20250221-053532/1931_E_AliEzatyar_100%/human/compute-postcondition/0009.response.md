Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, and the length of `num` is at least 1, if the character `num[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` is 0, `num` is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, and the length of `num` is at least 1, and the first character of `num` is not '0', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
