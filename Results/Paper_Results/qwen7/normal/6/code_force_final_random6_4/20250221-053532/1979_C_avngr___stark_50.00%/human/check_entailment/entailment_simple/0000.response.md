Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to distribute coins among different outcomes in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received for each winning outcome.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers if they were coprime. However, the program uses the product directly without checking for coprimality, which is not necessary for this problem.
   - It then divides this product by each multiplier to get the corresponding bet amounts (`c`).
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to find the GCD of these bet amounts.
   - It then divides each bet amount by this GCD to simplify the numbers.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of these simplified bet amounts is less than the simplified LCM. If so, it prints the bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to calculate the bet amounts and check the condition is correct.
   - The use of the GCD to simplify the bet amounts is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
