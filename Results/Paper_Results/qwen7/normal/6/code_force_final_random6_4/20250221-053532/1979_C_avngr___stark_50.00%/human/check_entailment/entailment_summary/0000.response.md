Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Key Logic in the Code**:
   - The code calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`.
   - It then computes the individual bets as `m / k_i` for each outcome.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find the GCD of these bets.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the bets divided by the GCD is still less than or equal to `m / hcf`. If so, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the adjusted bets.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The logic for calculating the initial bets as `m / k_i` is correct because it ensures that the sum of these bets is minimized while satisfying the condition.
   - The GCD calculation using `func_1` is also correct as it helps in scaling down the bets to their smallest form without changing the relative proportions.
   - The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome, which is the core requirement of the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing -1.
   - The constraints are within the limits specified in the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as per the given specifications and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
