Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the total bet should be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - It then calculates the individual bets required to meet the condition using the formula `m / k[i]`.
   - It finds the highest common factor (HCF) of these calculated bets.
   - It divides each calculated bet by the HCF to get the smallest set of bets that satisfy the condition.
   - It checks if the sum of these bets is less than or equal to the HCF times the smallest multiplier. If so, it prints `-1` because it's not possible to meet the condition. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the bets and checking the condition seems correct.
   - The use of the greatest common divisor (GCD) to find the smallest set of bets is appropriate.
   - The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` ensures that the total bet is not less than the smallest winning amount divided by the HCF, which is necessary for the condition to hold true.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where a solution does not exist correctly by printing `-1`.
   - The constraints are within the limits provided, and the logic should work as expected.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
