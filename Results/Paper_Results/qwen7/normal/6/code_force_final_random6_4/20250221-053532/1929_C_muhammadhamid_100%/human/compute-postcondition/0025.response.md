Output State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The calculation for `s` is not performed here, so the initial state of `s` is not updated.
