Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer that must be at least 0 (since it has been incremented by at least 3 through the loop), `i` is `x + 2`, `s` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1` plus 1 for each iteration from 0 to `x-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` remains as initially entered by the user, `x` is at least 3 more than its initial value (since the loop has executed at least 3 times), `i` is `x + 2`, and `s` is the result of repeatedly updating itself by adding the integer division of its current value by `k-1` plus 1, for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `x-1`.
