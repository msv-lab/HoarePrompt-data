Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers entered by the user; `s` is 1**

The code initializes the variable `s` to 1, which does not affect the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as integers entered by the user, while `s` is explicitly set to 1.
