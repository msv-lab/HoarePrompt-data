Output State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer that must be at least x + 3, `i` is x + 2, `s` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `s` by k-1 plus 1**.

To break it down:
- `k` remains unchanged as it is an integer entered by the user.
- `x` remains unchanged as it is an integer that must be at least x + 3.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is x + 2.
- `s` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1` plus 1. Therefore, the new value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus `s // (k-1) + 1`.
