### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect because it assumes Sasha always wins after a loss, which might not be the case. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 1, representing the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins `n`.

3. **Loop Calculation**:
   - The loop runs `x` times, updating `s` using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - This formula is meant to simulate the growth of Sasha's coins based on the betting strategy, where Sasha doubles his bet after a loss and continues until he wins.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Detailed Analysis

The key insight is that the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is designed to ensure Sasha can recover from any sequence of up to `x` consecutive losses. Here's why:

- **Initial Value**: `s` starts at 1.
- **Loop Update**: Each iteration updates `s` to account for the potential growth after a loss. The term `s // (k - 1) + 1` ensures that Sasha can recover from a loss and continue betting.

Given the promotion rule that Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row, the loop effectively simulates the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times consecutively and then wins. The value of `s` after `x` iterations represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can recover from any sequence of `x` consecutive losses.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Worst-Case Scenario**:
   - If Sasha loses `x` times consecutively, he will have `1 / (k - 1)^x` coins left.
   - After the `x`th loss, he will place a bet of `1 / (k - 1)^x` coins and win, recovering to `1 / (k - 1)^{x-1}` coins.
   - This process continues until he recovers to `s` coins.

2. **Guaranteed Outcome**:
   - Since `s` is calculated to be `x + 1`, Sasha can always recover from any sequence of `x` consecutive losses and continue betting until he has at least `n` coins.

### Conclusion

The program correctly simulates the worst-case scenario and ensures that Sasha can recover from any sequence of `x` consecutive losses. Therefore, the original assessment was incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
