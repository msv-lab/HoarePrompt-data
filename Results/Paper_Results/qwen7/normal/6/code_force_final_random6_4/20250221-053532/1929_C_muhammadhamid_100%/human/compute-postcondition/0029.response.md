Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `x` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `a` is an integer entered by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `s` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop body.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `s` remains 2.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 1, `s` is 2**
