Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    4 88 1000000000
    
    25 69 231
    
    13 97 18806

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `k` retains its final value as determined by the loop's conditions, `x` also retains its final value as determined by the loop's conditions, and `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `i` is set to `x + 1` because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`, making `i` equal to `x` after all iterations. The variable `s` is updated through the loop to include the sum of `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`. Given the operations `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` starting from `s = 1`, `s` will be the sum of 1 plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration, which ultimately results in `s` being `x + 1`.
    #
    #To summarize, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
    #- `k`: The integer value entered by the user.
    #- `x`: The integer value entered by the user.
    #- `a`: The integer value entered by the user, unchanged.
    #- `i`: Equal to `x`.
    #- `s`: The sum of 1 plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`, resulting in `s = x + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each input, it calculates a value \( s \) starting from 1 and updating it through a loop where \( s \) is incremented by \( s // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x \) iterations. After the loop, it prints 'Yes' if \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \), otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input.
