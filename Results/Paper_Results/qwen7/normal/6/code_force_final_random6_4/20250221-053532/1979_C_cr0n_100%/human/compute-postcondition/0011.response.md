Output State: **`den` is equal to the result of applying the function `func_1` iteratively `N` times to the initial value `den`, with each application using the next element from the list `vals`; `vprod` is a list of values obtained by performing integer division of `den` by each element in `vals`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a list `vprod` where each element is the result of integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- The value of `den` remains unchanged because no operation modifies it directly in this line of code.
- The list comprehension `(den // r) for r in vals` generates a new list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` divided by each element in `vals` (integer division).
- The initial state of `den` being the result of applying `func_1` iteratively `N` times to the initial value `den` with each application using the next element from `vals` is preserved.
