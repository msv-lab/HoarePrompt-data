Output State: `den` is equal to the result of applying the function `func_1` successively to all elements in the list `vals`, starting with the initial value of `den`.

In more detail, if we denote the elements of `vals` as \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N\), then after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `den` will be:

\[ \text{den} = \text{func\_1}(\text{func\_1}(\ldots \text{func\_1}(\text{den}, x_1), x_2), \ldots, x_N) \]

This means that `den` undergoes the function `func_1` applied to each element in `vals` in sequence, with the output of each application becoming the input for the next application.
