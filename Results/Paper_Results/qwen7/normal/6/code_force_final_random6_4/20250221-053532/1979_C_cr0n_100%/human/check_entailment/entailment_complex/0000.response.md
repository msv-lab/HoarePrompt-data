### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount we would get back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), the payout multiplier \( k_i \) is given, and we need to find non-negative integers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i
     \]

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) by dividing their product by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]
   - This function is correctly implemented.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the input for each test case.
   - It reads \( N \) (the number of outcomes) and a list of multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N \).
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier \( k_1 \).
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to `den` using each subsequent multiplier in the list, effectively calculating the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding multiplier.
   - It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and exits.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the total bet amount is less than the payout for each outcome.
   - The use of LCM and division by GCD correctly handles the requirement that the total bet must be strictly less than the payout for any outcome.
   - The subtraction of the sum of `vprod` from `den` ensures that the remaining value is positive, which represents the total bet amount.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The implementation handles the edge case where the total bet amount might be zero or negative by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. All functions together meet the problem description and handle all specified cases appropriately.
