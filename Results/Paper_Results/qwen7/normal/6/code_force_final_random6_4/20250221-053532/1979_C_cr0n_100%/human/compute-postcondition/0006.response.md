Output State: **`den` is equal to `func_1(den, x)` again**.

Explanation: The code `den = func_1(den, x)` simply reassigns the value of `den` to the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `den` and `x`. Since `den` was already equal to `func_1(den, x)` before this line of code, after executing this line, `den` remains unchanged and is still equal to `func_1(den, x)`. The other preconditions (N being at least 1 and `vals` being a list with at least two elements) remain unaffected.
