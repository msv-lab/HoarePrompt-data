Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to find a common denominator for the multipliers and then distributes the bets based on this common denominator. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```

The program calculates the common denominator `den` as follows:
- `den = 7`
- For each `x` in `[9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`, it updates `den` using `func_1(den, x)`.

The updated `den` would be calculated as:
- `den = 7 * 9 // gcd(7, 9) = 63`
- `den = 63 * 3 // gcd(63, 3) = 63`
- `den = 63 * 17 // gcd(63, 17) = 63`
- `den = 63 * 9 // gcd(63, 9) = 63`
- `den = 63 * 13 // gcd(63, 13) = 63`

Then, `vprod` is calculated as:
- `vprod = [63 // 7, 63 // 9, 63 // 3, 63 // 17, 63 // 9, 63 // 13] = [9, 7, 21, 3, 7, 4]`

Finally, `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod) = 63 - (9 + 7 + 21 + 3 + 7 + 4) = 22`.

Since `den` is positive, the program prints the values in `vprod`. However, this distribution does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each winning outcome.

For instance, if the 4th outcome wins, the player would receive `17 * 3 = 51` coins, but the total bet is `9 + 7 + 21 + 3 + 7 + 4 = 51`, which is not strictly less.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
