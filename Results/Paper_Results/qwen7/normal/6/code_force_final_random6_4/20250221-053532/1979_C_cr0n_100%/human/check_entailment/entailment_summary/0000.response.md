### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \( i \), the multiplier \( k_i \) determines the payout if that outcome wins.
   - We need to find a distribution of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_1 x_1, k_2 x_2, \ldots, k_n x_n) \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \). However, the problem does not require LCM; instead, it requires a different approach.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N \).
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier \( k_1 \).
     - It iteratively updates `den` using the `func_1` function, which is actually calculating the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
     - After the loop, it calculates `vprod` as \( \frac{den}{k_i} \) for each \( k_i \).
     - It then checks if the remaining value of `den` after subtracting the sum of `vprod` is positive.
     - If `den` is non-positive, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints the values of `vprod`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed because it uses the LCM to calculate `den`, which does not help in solving the problem. Instead, we need to find a way to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the minimum payout.
   - The approach should involve finding a common denominator that is smaller than the smallest multiplier and then distributing the bets accordingly.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
