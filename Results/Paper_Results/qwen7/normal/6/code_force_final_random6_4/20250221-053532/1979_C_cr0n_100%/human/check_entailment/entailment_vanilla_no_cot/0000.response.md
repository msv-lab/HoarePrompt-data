Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program only handles a specific case where it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributes the coins in a way that ensures the total bet is less than the LCM. However, the problem requires that the total bet must be strictly less than the product of the multiplier and the bet amount for each winning outcome. 

The function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem because:

1. It calculates the LCM of all multipliers and then divides it by each multiplier to get a list of values. This approach does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the product of the multiplier and the bet amount for each winning outcome.
2. It subtracts the sum of the calculated values from the LCM to find an additional amount to distribute, which may not satisfy the condition for all outcomes.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the product of the multiplier and the bet amount for each winning outcome. A more appropriate approach would involve finding a distribution of bets that satisfies this condition for all outcomes, which is not achieved by the current implementation.

Here's a revised approach to solve the problem:

```python
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    
    # Find the maximum value of k_i
    max_k = max(vals)
    
    # Distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than max_k * (sum of all bets)
    total_bet = 1
    while True:
        if all(total_bet < k * total_bet for k in vals):
            break
        total_bet += 1
    
    # Calculate individual bets
    bets = [total_bet // k for k in vals]
    
    # Adjust the last bet to ensure the total bet is exactly total_bet
    bets[-1] += total_bet - sum(bets)
    
    if all(total_bet < k * b for k, b in zip(vals, bets)):
        print(' '.join(str(b) for b in bets))
    else:
        print(-1)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the product of the multiplier and the bet amount for each winning outcome.
