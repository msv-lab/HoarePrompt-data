### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount we would receive back for any winning outcome.

#### Given Program Breakdown
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input for one test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N`.
   - It reads the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers (`den`).
   - It then computes the values `vprod` which represent the maximum possible bet for each outcome such that the total bet is less than the reward for any outcome.
   - Finally, it prints the values `vprod` if the total bet is less than the reward for any outcome; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

#### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Calculation of LCM**:
   - The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the total bet is minimized while ensuring the condition is met.

2. **Bet Calculation**:
   - For each outcome, the bet is calculated as `den // r`, where `r` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - The sum of these bets should be less than the LCM value (`den`).

3. **Checking Condition**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total bet is less than the LCM value (`den`).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

#### Testing the Logic
- The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the required conditions.
- The use of LCM ensures that the total bet is minimized.
- The check at the end ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any outcome.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the bet calculation. Specifically, the bet calculation `den // r` does not necessarily ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any outcome. Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

- Suppose we have three outcomes with multipliers `[3, 2, 7]`.
- The LCM of these multipliers is `42` (since \( \text{lcm}(3, 2, 7) = 42 \)).
- The bets calculated as `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, and `42 // 7 = 6`.
- The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is indeed less than `42`.

However, if we consider another set of multipliers `[3, 3, 3]`:
- The LCM of these multipliers is `3` (since \( \text{lcm}(3, 3, 3) = 3 \)).
- The bets calculated as `3 // 3 = 1`, `3 // 3 = 1`, and `3 // 3 = 1`.
- The total bet is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is not strictly less than `3` (it is equal to `3`).

Therefore, the current implementation does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any outcome.

#### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any outcome in all cases.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
