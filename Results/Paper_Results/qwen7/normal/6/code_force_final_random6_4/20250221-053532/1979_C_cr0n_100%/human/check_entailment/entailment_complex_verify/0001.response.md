### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \), and if the \( i \)-th outcome wins, we get back \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \).
- We need to find a distribution of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i \) for all \( i \).

#### Given Program Breakdown
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_N \).
   - Calculates the LCM of all multipliers (`den`).
   - Computes the maximum possible bet for each outcome such that the total bet is less than the LCM value.
   - Prints the bets if the total bet is less than the LCM value; otherwise, prints `-1`.

#### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Calculation of LCM**:
   - The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the total bet is minimized.

2. **Bet Calculation**:
   - The bet for each outcome is calculated as `den // r`, where `r` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - However, this approach assumes that the LCM value (`den`) is the minimum total bet, which might not always be true. The LCM is the smallest number divisible by all multipliers, but it doesn't necessarily minimize the total bet under the given constraints.

3. **Checking Condition**:
   - The program checks if the total bet is less than the LCM value (`den`).
   - However, the total bet calculated as `den // r` for each outcome might not satisfy the condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i \) for all \( i \).

#### Testing the Logic
- Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
  - Input: 
    ```
    6
    3
    3 2 7
    2
    3 3
    5
    5 5 5 5 5
    6
    7 9 3 17 9 13
    3
    6 3 2
    5
    9 4 6 8 3
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    ```

- Let's verify the logic for the first test case:
  - Multipliers: \( 3, 2, 7 \)
  - LCM: \( 42 \)
  - Bets: \( 42 // 3 = 14 \), \( 42 // 2 = 21 \), \( 42 // 7 = 6 \)
  - Total bet: \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \)
  - Rewards: \( 3 \times 14 = 42 \), \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \), \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \)
  - Total bet is indeed less than the rewards for all outcomes.

- Now consider the second test case:
  - Multipliers: \( 3, 3 \)
  - LCM: \( 3 \)
  - Bets: \( 3 // 3 = 1 \), \( 3 // 3 = 1 \)
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - Rewards: \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \), \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \)
  - Total bet is less than the rewards for both outcomes.

- However, consider the third test case:
  - Multipliers: \( 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 \)
  - LCM: \( 5 \)
  - Bets: \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \)
  - Total bet: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \)
  - Rewards: \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \), \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \)
  - Total bet is not less than the rewards for any outcome.

#### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly distribute the coins to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the rewards for any winning outcome. The LCM approach does not guarantee the minimal total bet under the given constraints.

### Final Answer
