### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
- The amount received back for the \( i \)-th outcome is \( k_i \times \text{bet on } i \)-th outcome.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the product of two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It ensures that the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers when they are coprime.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - Computes the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1`.
   - Distributes the bets such that the total bet is equal to the computed LCM minus the sum of the individual bets.
   - If the remaining amount (`den`) is non-positive, it prints `-1` and exits.
   - Otherwise, it prints the individual bets.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Common Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program correctly computes the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1`.
   - This step is crucial because the LCM ensures that the bets can be evenly distributed across all outcomes without any remainder.

2. **Bet Distribution**:
   - The bets are distributed such that the total bet is `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - Each bet is calculated as `den // k_i`.
   - This ensures that the total bet is exactly `den`.

3. **Validation of Total Bet**:
   - The program checks if the remaining amount (`den`) is positive.
   - If `den` is positive, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the input:
```
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
```

1. **Compute LCM**:
   - Initial `den = 7`.
   - After processing all multipliers:
     - `den = 7 * 9 // gcd(7, 9) = 63`
     - `den = 63 * 3 // gcd(63, 3) = 63`
     - `den = 63 * 17 // gcd(63, 17) = 63`
     - `den = 63 * 9 // gcd(63, 9) = 63`
     - `den = 63 * 13 // gcd(63, 13) = 63`
   - So, `den = 63`.

2. **Distribute Bets**:
   - `vprod = [63 // 7, 63 // 9, 63 // 3, 63 // 17, 63 // 9, 63 // 13] = [9, 7, 21, 3, 7, 4]`.
   - Total bet = `63 - (9 + 7 + 21 + 3 + 7 + 4) = 22`.

3. **Validation**:
   - Since `den = 22` is positive, the bets are printed.

For the 4th outcome (with multiplier 17):
- Received coins = `17 * 3 = 51`.
- Total bet = `22 < 51`.

This example shows that the program correctly ensures the total bet is strictly less than the received coins for each winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the received coins for each winning outcome.

**Final: True**
