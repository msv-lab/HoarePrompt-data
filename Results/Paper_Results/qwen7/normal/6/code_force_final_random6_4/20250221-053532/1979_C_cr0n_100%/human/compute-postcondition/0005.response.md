Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `x in vals`. The variables involved here are `x` and `vals`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `vals`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `den` is equal to `func_1(den, x)` from the previous iteration.
   - `N` must be at least 1.
   - `vals` must be a list with at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is iterating over `vals`, at the end of each iteration, `x` takes the next value from `vals`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `vals` must still contain at least one element. After removing one element (the current `x`), `vals` should still have at least one element left.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `den` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `N` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `vals` must now be a list with at least two elements (since one element was consumed in the previous iteration).

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`den` is equal to `func_1(den, x)`, `N` must be at least 1, `vals` must be a list with at least two elements**
