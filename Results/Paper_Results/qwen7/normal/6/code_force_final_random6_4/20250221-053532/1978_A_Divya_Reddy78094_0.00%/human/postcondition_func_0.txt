The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 500) and a list of \( n \) integers (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100), where each integer \( a_i \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it sorts the list of integers in descending order and prints the sum of the first two elements. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.
