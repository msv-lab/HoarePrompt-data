Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `nums` is a list of sorted integers in descending order.

Given that `nums` is a list of sorted integers in descending order, the first element (`nums[0]`) will be the largest integer in the list, and the second element (`nums[1]`) will be the second largest integer in the list.

The print statement `print(nums[0] + nums[1])` will add these two largest integers together and print the result.

Output: **the sum of the largest and second largest integers in the list nums**
