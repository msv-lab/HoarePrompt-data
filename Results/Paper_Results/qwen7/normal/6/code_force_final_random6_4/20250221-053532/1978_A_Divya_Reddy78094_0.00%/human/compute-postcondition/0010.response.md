Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 2, which means `t` could be any integer starting from 2.
- `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not given.
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, meaning the largest integer is at index 0 and the next largest is at index 1.

Given the print statement `print(nums[0] + nums[1])`, we need to determine what will be printed.

Since `nums` is sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list, and `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list. The sum of these two integers will be printed.

However, without knowing the exact values of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of the list.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1]** (where `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list and `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list)
