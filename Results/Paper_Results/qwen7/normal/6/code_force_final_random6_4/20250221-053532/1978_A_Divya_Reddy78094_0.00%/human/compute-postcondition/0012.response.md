Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `n` is an integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and `nums`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
