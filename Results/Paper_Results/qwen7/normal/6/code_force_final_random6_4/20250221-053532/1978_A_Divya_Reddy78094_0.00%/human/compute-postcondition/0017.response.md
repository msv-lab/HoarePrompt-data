Output State: `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be set to 3, indicating that the loop ran exactly 3 times. For each iteration, `n` is an integer input, and `nums` is a list of integers that gets updated and sorted in descending order based on the input provided during that iteration.
