Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of sorted integers in descending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `nums` in descending order using `sort(reverse=True)`. This means that the elements in `nums` will be arranged from the largest to the smallest. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
