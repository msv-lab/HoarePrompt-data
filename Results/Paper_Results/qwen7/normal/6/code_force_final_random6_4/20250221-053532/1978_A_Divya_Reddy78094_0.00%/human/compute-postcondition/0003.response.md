Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
