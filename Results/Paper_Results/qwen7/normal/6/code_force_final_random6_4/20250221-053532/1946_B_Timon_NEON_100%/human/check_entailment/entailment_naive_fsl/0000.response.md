Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function is intended to find the maximum possible sum of the array after performing k operations. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays**: The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the insertion of subarray sums into the array. It only considers contiguous subarrays and does not account for the fact that we can insert the sum of any subarray anywhere in the array, which allows for more flexibility in achieving the maximum sum.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The function `func_2` does not fully explore all possible ways to insert subarray sums. It only considers the sum of subarrays ending at each index, but it does not consider inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times or at different positions.

3. **Missing Key Logic**: The function `func_2` does not account for the fact that we can insert the sum of a subarray multiple times, which could significantly increase the sum of the array. The current implementation only finds the maximum sum of a single subarray and does not explore the possibility of inserting this sum multiple times.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
