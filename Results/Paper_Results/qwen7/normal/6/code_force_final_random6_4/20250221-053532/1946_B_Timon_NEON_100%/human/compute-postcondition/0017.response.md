Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, `max_segment[0]` is `arr[0]`, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `arr[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
