Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. It returns a segment from `segments_variants` that has the highest first element, provided the segment has more than one element. If no such segment exists, it returns `[-1]`.**
