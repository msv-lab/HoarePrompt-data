You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to select a contiguous subarray and insert its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and the result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray can significantly increase the array's sum.
   - The optimal strategy often involves inserting sums of positive subarrays multiple times.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used correctly in the main logic to ensure the final result is within the required range.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it has some issues:
     - It does not handle negative subarrays correctly.
     - It only considers one segment at a time and does not explore combining different segments to form larger segments.
     - It does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of multiple subarrays.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we should consider the sum of the entire array and the sum of positive subarrays.
   - We can insert the sum of the entire array multiple times to increase the overall sum.
   - For negative subarrays, we should avoid them since they decrease the sum.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Calculate the sum of the entire array.
   - Calculate the sum of all positive elements.
   - Determine how many full insertions of the entire array can be made within `k` operations.
   - Handle the remaining operations by inserting the sum of positive subarrays if possible.

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation of `func_2`, it does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray, especially for handling negative subarrays. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
