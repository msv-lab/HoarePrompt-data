Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, the current value of `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, and the value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`. Given that `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `arr[i]` refers to the last element of `arr` (since list indices start from 0). However, since `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `arr[i]` would actually be out of bounds, but considering the condition that `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, it implies that `arr` has one more element beyond its actual length, which is not directly accessible. Nevertheless, the assignment is made, and other variables remain unchanged.
