Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `segment`, which is taken from `segments_variants`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `segments_variants`. If `segments_variants` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `segments_variants` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` is not empty.

4. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state mentions that `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr` and its second element being the end index of that subsegment, and `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be `max_segment`. `total_max_segment` is [-1].

Given these points, the critical adjustment needed is ensuring that `segments_variants` is not empty.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one segment**.
