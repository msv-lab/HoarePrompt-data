Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` and `new_segment` is not empty, or `new_segment + [i - 1]` with `max_segment` equal to `new_segment` if the condition `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` is false and `new_segment` is not empty; `new_segment` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This does not affect the condition or the content of `segments_variants`. The state of `segments_variants` remains as described in the initial postcondition, but now `new_segment` is explicitly an empty list.
