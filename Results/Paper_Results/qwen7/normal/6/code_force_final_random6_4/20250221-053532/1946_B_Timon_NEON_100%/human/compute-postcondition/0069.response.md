Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr` and its second element being the end index of that subsegment, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be `max_segment`, `total_max_segment` is [-1]**.

Explanation: The code initializes `total_max_segment` to a list containing `-1`. This does not affect the values of `max_sum`, `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, or `segments_variants`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
