Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains the list `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is formed by concatenating `new_segment` with `[i - 1]`. The initial state condition that `new_segment` is not empty remains valid, and no other variables are affected.
