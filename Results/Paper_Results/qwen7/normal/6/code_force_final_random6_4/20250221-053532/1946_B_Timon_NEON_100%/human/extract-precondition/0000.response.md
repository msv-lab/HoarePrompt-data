Precondition: **number is an integer, and quantity is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= quantity <= 2 * 10^5.** 

Note: The provided function `func_3` does not utilize the input parameters `number` and `quantity` as described in the problem statement. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations related to the problem. This suggests that the function might be a part of a larger solution or a placeholder. The precondition is based solely on the variables present in the function signature.
