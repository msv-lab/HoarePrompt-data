Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The provided code includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) but the third function `func_3` which is expected to calculate the maximum possible sum after performing `k` operations is incomplete and does not exist in the provided code snippet.
- Function `func_1` correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary for handling large sums.
- Function `func_2` aims to find the maximum sum subarray, but it seems to be overcomplicating the process. It could be simplified to use Kadane's algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum, which would be more efficient and appropriate for this problem.
- The third function `func_3` is missing entirely, which is crucial for solving the problem as stated. This function should handle the logic to maximize the array sum using the operations allowed.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to implement the third function to properly utilize the operations described and ensure the overall logic is sound.
