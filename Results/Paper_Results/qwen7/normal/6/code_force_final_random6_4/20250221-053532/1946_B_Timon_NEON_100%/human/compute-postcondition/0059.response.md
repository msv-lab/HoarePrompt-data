Output State: **`new_segment` is now `[arr[i], i]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `new_segment`. This new value is a list containing two elements: `arr[i]` and `i`. Since the initial state specifies that `new_segment` is not empty, it implies that `new_segment` was already holding some value before this line of code was executed. However, after executing this line, `new_segment` is updated to be the list `[arr[i], i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
