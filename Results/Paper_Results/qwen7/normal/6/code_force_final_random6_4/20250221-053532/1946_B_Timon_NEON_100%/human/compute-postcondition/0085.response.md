Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a segment from `segments_variants` that has the highest sum, provided the segment has more than one element. If no such segment exists, it returns `[-1]`. The function identifies all subsegments with non-negative sums and keeps track of the segment with the highest sum encountered. It then returns the segment with the highest sum from these candidates.**
