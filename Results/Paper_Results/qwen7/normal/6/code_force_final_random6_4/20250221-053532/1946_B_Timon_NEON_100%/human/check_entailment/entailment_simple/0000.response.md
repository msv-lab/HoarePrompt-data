Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array through a series of operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The operations can be performed up to `k` times.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that adding the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the array's sum. Specifically, if the maximum sum subarray is found and added `2^k` times, the overall sum can be maximized.
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Analysis of Functions**:
   - **func_2**: This function is designed to find the subarray with the maximum sum. However, there are issues in how it handles negative and positive segments:
     - It incorrectly resets `new_segment` when encountering a negative value without considering the possibility that the previous segment might still be the maximum sum.
     - It appends the current segment to `segments_variants` even if it is not the maximum sum, which is unnecessary.
     - It should only append the current segment to `segments_variants` if it is the maximum sum found so far.
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the program.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` needs to be corrected to ensure it finds the maximum sum subarray correctly.
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not guarantee finding the correct maximum sum subarray, especially in cases with multiple subarrays having the same maximum sum.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
