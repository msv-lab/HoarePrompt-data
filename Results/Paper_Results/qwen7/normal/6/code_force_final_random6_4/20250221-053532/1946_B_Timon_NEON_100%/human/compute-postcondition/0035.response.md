Postcondition: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment with its start point increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, -1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]` and `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `segments_variants` remains an empty list if `new_segment` is empty, and the current value of `i` is the length of `arr`; `segments_variants` is appended with either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` depending on whether `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`.
