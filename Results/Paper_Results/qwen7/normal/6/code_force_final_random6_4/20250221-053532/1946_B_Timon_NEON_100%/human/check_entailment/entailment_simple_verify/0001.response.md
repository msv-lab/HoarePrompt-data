### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation allows selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The optimal strategy involves maximizing the sum by inserting the sum of positive subarrays multiple times.
   - Negative subarrays should be avoided as they decrease the sum.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **func_2**: This function is intended to find the maximum sum subarray but has several issues:
     - It does not handle negative subarrays correctly.
     - It only considers one segment at a time and does not explore combining different segments to form larger segments.
     - It does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of multiple subarrays.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the sum of the entire array.
   - Calculate the sum of all positive elements.
   - Determine how many full insertions of the entire array can be made within `k` operations.
   - Handle the remaining operations by inserting the sum of positive subarrays if possible.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_2` returns the segment with the highest sum, but it does not handle negative subarrays correctly and does not explore combining different segments.
   - The main logic in the annotated code uses `func_2` to get the maximum sum subarray and then calculates the final result using this information.
   - The logic for calculating the final result seems to be correct, but it relies on the incorrect `func_2`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite the correct use of `func_1` and the correct approach in the main logic, the implementation of `func_2` is flawed, leading to an incorrect solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_2`.
