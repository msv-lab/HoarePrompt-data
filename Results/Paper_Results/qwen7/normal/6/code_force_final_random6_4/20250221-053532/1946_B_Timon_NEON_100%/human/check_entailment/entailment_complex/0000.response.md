Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves inserting the sum of a contiguous subarray into the array. The operations can be performed on any subarray, possibly empty, and the goal is to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key insight is that inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the sum of the array. However, the optimal strategy involves identifying the subarray with the highest sum and using it optimally.
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the subarray with the maximum sum. However, the logic in `func_2` seems flawed because it does not correctly identify the maximum subarray sum. Instead, it tracks segments but does not ensure the maximum sum is found.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The function `func_3` is not used in the provided code, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum subarray but does not handle negative numbers correctly. It resets `new_segment` when encountering a negative number, which might lead to missing the actual maximum sum subarray.
   - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not ensure that the maximum sum subarray is identified correctly.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program relies on the output of `func_2`, which is supposed to provide the maximum sum subarray. However, due to the flaws in `func_2`, the program may not produce the correct result.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray, leading to potentially incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
