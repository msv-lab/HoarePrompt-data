Postcondition: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element increased by `arr[i-1]` if `arr[i-1]` is non-negative, otherwise it remains `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is the length of `arr`.
