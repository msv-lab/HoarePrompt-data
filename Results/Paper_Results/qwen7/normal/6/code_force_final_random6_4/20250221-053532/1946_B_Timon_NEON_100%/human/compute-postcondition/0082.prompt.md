Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr` and its second element being the end index of that subsegment, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be `max_segment`, `total_max_segment` is [-1]
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment; `total_max_segment` is now equal to the first segment of `segments_variants` and the length of `segment` is not 1. If the condition `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1` is true, then `total_max_segment` remains unchanged. If the condition is false, `total_max_segment` is updated to the first segment of `segments_variants`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment, and `total_max_segment` is now equal to the current `segment` if the first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of `segment` and `segment` has more than one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and `segment` has more than one element, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
