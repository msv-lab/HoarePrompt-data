Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Analyze the postconditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_sum` is -1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i], i]`.
   - `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`.
   - `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list.
   - The current value of `i` is decremented by 1 if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it remains the length of `arr`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(arr) - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The list `arr` remains unchanged.
   - The conditions for `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` depend on the value of `arr[i]` and the value of `i`.

Given the above analysis, let's summarize the state at the start of the next iteration:

- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- The list `arr` remains the same.
- The conditions for `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` will be evaluated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i], i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is `i + 1`**.

In a more concise form:

**State: `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i+1]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i+1], i+1]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i+1], i+1]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is `i + 1`.**
