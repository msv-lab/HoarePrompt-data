You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr` and its second element being the end index of that subsegment, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be `max_segment`, and `max_segment[0]` is the highest sum found among all subsegments of `arr`.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `max_sum` does not change because it was initialized to -1 and no operation modifies it.
    #- `arr` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the original array.
    #- `new_segment` will be an empty list if no positive subsegment was found, or it will contain the last positive or zero-valued subsegment encountered.
    #- `max_segment` will hold the subsegment with the highest sum found during the iteration of the array.
    #- `segments_variants` will contain all subsegments that had the highest sum at some point during the iteration.
    #- `max_segment[0]` will be the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr`.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `segments_variants` contains at least one segment, and `total_max_segment` is equal to the segment from `segments_variants` that has the highest first element (i.e., the maximum sum of any subsegment), provided that the segment has more than one element. If no such segment exists, `total_max_segment` remains [-1].
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns a segment from `segments_variants` that has the highest first element, provided the segment has more than one element. If no such segment exists, it returns `[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. It returns a segment from `segments_variants` that has the highest first element, provided the segment has more than one element. If no such segment exists, it returns `[-1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a segment from `segments_variants` that has the highest first element, provided the segment has more than one element. If no such segment exists, it returns `[-1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
