Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is not empty, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `new_segment + [i - 1]` to the list `segments_variants`. Given that `i` is 0, the appended list is `new_segment + [-1]`. Since `new_segment` is not specified to be empty, it is assumed to contain some elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
