Output State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one segment; total_max_segment is now equal to the first segment; the length of segment is not 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the `segment` to `total_max_segment`. This means that `total_max_segment` now holds the same value as the first segment. The precondition that `segments_variants` must contain at least one segment and that the length of `segment` is not 1 remains unchanged.
