Postcondition: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i], i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is decremented by 1.**
