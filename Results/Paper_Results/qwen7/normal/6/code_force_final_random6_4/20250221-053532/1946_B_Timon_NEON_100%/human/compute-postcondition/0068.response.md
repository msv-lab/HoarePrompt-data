Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr` and its second element being the end index of that subsegment, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` now includes `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`. This means that `segments_variants` now contains all previously existing segments plus the new segment formed by appending the last index of `arr` to `new_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged.
