Output State: `max_sum` remains -1, `arr` remains a list of integers, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a segment ending at the last index of `arr`, `max_segment` is a segment with its first element being the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr` and its second element being the end index of that subsegment, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible segments that could be `max_segment`, and `max_segment[0]` is the highest sum found among all subsegments of `arr`.

In more detail:
- `max_sum` does not change because it was initialized to -1 and no operation modifies it.
- `arr` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify the original array.
- `new_segment` will be an empty list if no positive subsegment was found, or it will contain the last positive or zero-valued subsegment encountered.
- `max_segment` will hold the subsegment with the highest sum found during the iteration of the array.
- `segments_variants` will contain all subsegments that had the highest sum at some point during the iteration.
- `max_segment[0]` will be the maximum sum of any subsegment in `arr`.
