Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `i` is the only variable in the loop head.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_sum` is -1
   - `arr` is a list of integers
   - `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i], i]`
   - `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`
   - `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list
   - The current value of `i` is decremented by 1 if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it remains the length of `arr`

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1 if `new_segment` is not empty, and incremented by 1 in each iteration otherwise, we need to consider both cases.
   - If `new_segment` is not empty, `i` will be decremented by 1.
   - If `new_segment` is empty, `i` will remain the same (i.e., `len(arr)`).

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - If `new_segment` is not empty, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - If `new_segment` is empty, the next value of `i` will be `len(arr)`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time. Since the exact value of `new_segment` is not specified, we consider both possibilities.

### Possible States:

- **If `new_segment` is not empty**:
  - `i` will be `i - 1`
  - The other variables (`max_sum`, `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.

- **If `new_segment` is empty**:
  - `i` will be `len(arr)`
  - The other variables (`max_sum`, `arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`) remain unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact value of `new_segment`, we provide both possible states.

### Final Answer:

**State:**
- If `new_segment` is not empty: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i], i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is `i - 1`**
- If `new_segment` is empty: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, otherwise it is `[arr[i], i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]` if `new_segment` is empty, otherwise it is `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` if `new_segment` is not empty, otherwise it is an empty list, and the current value of `i` is `len(arr)`**
