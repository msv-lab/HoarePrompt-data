Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is not empty, `max_segment` is [0, 0] with the first element increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 1 (since `i` was 0 before and now it is incremented by 1), and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. Since `i` was initially 0 and the condition `arr[i] >= 0` is satisfied, `i` is incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
