Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples, each containing a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.**

The code creates a list of tuples named `pq`. Each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
