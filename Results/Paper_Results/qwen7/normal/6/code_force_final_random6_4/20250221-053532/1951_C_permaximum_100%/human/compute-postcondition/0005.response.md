State: **`price_increase` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, the initial value of `tickets_bought` must satisfy this condition.
3. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0.
4. Therefore, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k` for the loop to execute the first time.

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop condition directly.
