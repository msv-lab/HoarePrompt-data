Output State: **`tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `day` is the value popped from the priority queue `pq`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `price` is now `price + price_increase`, `day` is the value popped from the priority queue `pq`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`**.

Explanation: The line `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` pops an element from the priority queue `pq` and assigns the first value of the tuple to `price` and the second value to `day`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
