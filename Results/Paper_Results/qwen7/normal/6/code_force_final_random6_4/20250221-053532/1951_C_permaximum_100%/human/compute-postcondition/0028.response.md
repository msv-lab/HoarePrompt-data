Output State: **The program returns the total cost of all tickets bought, which is the cumulative sum of the cost of each ticket purchased over all iterations.**

This means that the program calculates the total cost of all tickets bought by summing up the cost of each individual ticket across all iterations of the loop. The total cost includes the base price of each ticket plus any increases due to `price_increase`.
