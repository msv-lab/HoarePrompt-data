Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, and `pq` has been transformed into a min-heap; `total_cost` is 0; `tickets_bought` is 0.**

The code simply initializes the variable `tickets_bought` to 0. No changes are made to the existing state of `pq` or `total_cost`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values.
