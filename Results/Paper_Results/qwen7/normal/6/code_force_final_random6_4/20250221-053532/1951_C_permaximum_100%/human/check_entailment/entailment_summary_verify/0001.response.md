### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves purchasing tickets over multiple days with increasing prices based on the number of tickets bought on any given day. The goal is to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost of buying `k` tickets.
   - In `func_1`, a priority queue (min-heap) is used to always consider the cheapest available ticket price.
   - The algorithm iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest available price, updating the price increase and total cost accordingly.
   - The logic to calculate the number of tickets to buy each day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`) ensures that the maximum allowed tickets per day are bought unless fewer are needed to reach `k`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the algorithm always considers the lowest possible price for the next ticket purchase.
   - The logic for updating the price increase after each purchase is correctly implemented.
   - The overall structure of the algorithm matches the problem requirements and examples provided.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic for updating the price increase and the tickets bought does not account for the fact that the price increase should only apply to the remaining days after the current purchase. Instead, the current implementation incorrectly applies the price increase to all future days regardless of the remaining days.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Incorrect Price Increase Logic**:
  - The line `price_increase += tickets_to_buy` should only update the price increase for the remaining days, not for all future days.
  - The current implementation adds `tickets_to_buy` to `price_increase` every time a ticket is bought, which leads to an incorrect calculation of future prices.

### Corrected Implementation:

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the price increase is applied only to the remaining days after the current purchase. This can be achieved by maintaining a separate variable to track the remaining days and applying the price increase only within those remaining days.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    remaining_days = n
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        if remaining_days > 0:
            total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
            tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
            price_increase += tickets_to_buy
            remaining_days -= 1
    return total_cost
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected implementation, the original assessment was **inaccurate** because the original code did not correctly handle the price increase for the remaining days.

**Final: False**
