Output State: **`price_increase` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0.**

The code simply initializes `price_increase` to 0, without affecting the values of `total_cost` and `tickets_bought`, nor altering the state of the min-heap `pq`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
