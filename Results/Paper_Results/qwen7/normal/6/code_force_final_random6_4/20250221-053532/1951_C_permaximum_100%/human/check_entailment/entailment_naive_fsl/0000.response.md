Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) exceeds the product of `m` and `n`. In such cases, the program will not correctly distribute the tickets across the days and will not account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a particular day.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
5 10 15
1 2 3 4 5
```
Here, `n = 5`, `m = 10`, and `k = 15`. The program should be able to buy 15 tickets within these constraints. However, the current implementation will fail because it does not properly distribute the tickets across the days to minimize the total cost.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it distributes the tickets across the days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the price increases after purchasing tickets on a particular day. The current implementation assumes that it can always buy `m` tickets on each day, which is not necessarily true if `k` exceeds `m * n`.

A correct approach would involve dynamically deciding how many tickets to buy on each day to minimize the total cost, taking into account the price increases.
