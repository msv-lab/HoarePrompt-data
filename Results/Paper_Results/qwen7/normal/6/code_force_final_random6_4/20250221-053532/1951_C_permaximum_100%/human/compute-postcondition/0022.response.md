This output state reflects that the value of `tickets_to_buy` is recalculated as the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. The `price_increase` is then increased by the value of `tickets_to_buy`, and the `day` is popped from the priority queue `pq`. The `tickets_bought` is increased by the value of `tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is updated by adding `price * tickets_to_buy`, and `price` is increased by `price_increase`. The `day` is popped again from the priority queue `pq`, and `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy` once more, and `price` is further increased by `price_increase`.
