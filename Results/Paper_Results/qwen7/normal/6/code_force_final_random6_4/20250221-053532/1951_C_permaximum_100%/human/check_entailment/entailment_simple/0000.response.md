Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples containing the price and index of each day's ticket price. This helps in efficiently getting the day with the lowest price.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a heap to always process the day with the lowest current price. It ensures that the price increases for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought on the current day.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program correctly calculates the number of tickets to buy each day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`), updates the total cost (`total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy`), and increments the `price_increase` accordingly. This logic ensures that the tickets are bought in such a way that the total cost is minimized.

5. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`. At this point, the program correctly returns the `total_cost`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the `total_cost` for each test case, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
