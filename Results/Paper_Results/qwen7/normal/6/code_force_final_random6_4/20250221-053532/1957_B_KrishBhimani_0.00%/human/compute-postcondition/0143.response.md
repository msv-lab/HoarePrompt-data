Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`, `c` is 1, and `ans` contains [-0]**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `c` being 1 while retaining the original values of `k`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans`.
