Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 20.**

Explanation: The loop runs 4 times because `k` starts at 14 (binary `1110`), and each iteration shifts `k` right by one bit, reducing its value until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the value of `i` (initially 16) is appended to `arr` and then incremented by 1. After 4 iterations, `k` becomes 0, and `i` becomes 20.
