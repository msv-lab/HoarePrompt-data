Output State: **`i` is 0, `c` is 14, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128, 0, 0]`, `l1` is a list of strings from user input, `n` is an integer from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer from the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `i = 0` sets the value of `i` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
