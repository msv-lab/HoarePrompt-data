Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, 3, and 4, `i` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. After the third iteration, `k` becomes 0 because it is being right-shifted each time. Therefore, the loop terminates. At this point, `i` will be 5 because `i` increments by 1 with each iteration. The list `arr` contains all the indices `i` where `k & 1 == 1` (i.e., where `k` is odd), which are 0, 1, 3, and 4.
