Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `arr`. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
