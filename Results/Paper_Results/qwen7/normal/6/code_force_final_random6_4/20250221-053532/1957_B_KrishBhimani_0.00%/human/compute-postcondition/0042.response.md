Output State: **`i` is 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`; `k` is 1; `k0` is equal to 4; `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4]; `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2]; `c` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends `1 << i` (which is `1 << 1` or `2`) to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[4, 1, 0]`. After appending `2`, `ans` becomes `[4, 1, 0, 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
