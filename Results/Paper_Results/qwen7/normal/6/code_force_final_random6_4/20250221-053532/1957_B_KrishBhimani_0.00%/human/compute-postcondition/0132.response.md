Output State: **`k` is half of its original value, `arr` contains the integers `i`, `i+1`, and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`k` and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `k` is still half of its original value, `arr` still contains the integers `i`, `i+1`, and `i+1`, and `i` is now increased by 1 compared to its previous value.
