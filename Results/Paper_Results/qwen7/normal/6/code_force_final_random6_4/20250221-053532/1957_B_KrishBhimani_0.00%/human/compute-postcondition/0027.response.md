Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `i` is 8, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. Since `c` was not previously defined, it is now set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
