Output State: **`i` must be one of the values in `arr` = [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191]; `c` is `c` + 1; `ans` is a list with a new element `1 << i` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` (which is `2^i`) to the list `ans`. Since `i` is one of the values in `arr`, `1 << i` will be a power of 2 corresponding to the value of `i`. The values of `c` and `n` are not provided, so we cannot determine if `c` equals `n - 1` or not. However, we know that `c` is incremented by 1, and the new element `1 << i` is appended to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
