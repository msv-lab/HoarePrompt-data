Output State: `k` is 0, `arr` contains the integers from 0 to 15, and `i` is 16.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. In each iteration, if `k` is odd, the current value of `i` is appended to `arr`. Then, `k` is right-shifted by one bit (equivalent to dividing by 2) and `i` is incremented by 1. This process repeats until `k` becomes 0. Since the initial value of `k` is `k0` which is 127 (as inferred from the pattern in the initial `ans` list), it will take exactly 7 iterations to reduce `k` to 0. During these iterations, `i` will take on the values 0 through 15, and each of these values will be appended to `arr`. After the loop completes, `k` will be 0, `arr` will contain the sequence of integers from 0 to 15, and `i` will be 16.
