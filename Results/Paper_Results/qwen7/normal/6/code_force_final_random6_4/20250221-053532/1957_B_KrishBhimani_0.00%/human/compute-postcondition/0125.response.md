Output State: **`k` is now half of its original value, `arr` contains the integers `i` and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The bitwise right shift operator (`>>`) divides the value of `k` by 2 (equivalent to `k / 2`). Since `k` must be non-zero, after the operation, `k` will be half of its original value. The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
