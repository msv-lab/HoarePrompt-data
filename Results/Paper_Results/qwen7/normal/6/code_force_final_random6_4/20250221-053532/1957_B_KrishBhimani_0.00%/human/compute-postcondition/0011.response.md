Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0 >> 1), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the bits of `k` to the right by one position, effectively dividing `k` by 2. The value of `k0` remains unchanged as it was assigned before the shift operation. All other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `arr`, `i`) remain unaffected by this operation.
