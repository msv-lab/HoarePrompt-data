Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is now equal to `k` right-shifted by 1 bit (which is equivalent to `k // 2`), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
