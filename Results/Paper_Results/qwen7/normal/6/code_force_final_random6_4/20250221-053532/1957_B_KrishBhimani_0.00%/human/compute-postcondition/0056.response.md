Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the list `l1` which is a list of strings obtained from the input split, and converts each string into an integer using `map(int, l1)`. It then assigns the first converted integer to `n` and the second converted integer to `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
