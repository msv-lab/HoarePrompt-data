Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 0, `c` is 2, `ans` contains [0, -1, 2, -2, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` (which is `1` since `i` is `0`) to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[0, -1, 2, -2]`. After executing the code, `ans` becomes `[0, -1, 2, -2, 1]`. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
