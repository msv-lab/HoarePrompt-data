Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is `k` right-shifted by 1, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 3, `i` is 4.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 3, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
