Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8], `c` is 3.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of \(1\) left-shifted by `i` (which is 3) to the list `ans`. The value of \(1 << 3\) is \(8\). Since `i` is 3, the value 8 is appended to the list `ans`, making it `[4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
