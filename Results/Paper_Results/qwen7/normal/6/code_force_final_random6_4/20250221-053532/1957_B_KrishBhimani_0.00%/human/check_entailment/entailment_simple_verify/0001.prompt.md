You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1

        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more inputs to process. After all iterations, `i` will be 255 (since the maximum value for `k` is \(10^9\) and the binary representation of numbers up to \(10^9\) has 29 bits, but `i` starts from 0 and goes up to 255 in the given code). The value of `t` will remain within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `l1` will contain the last input split into a list of strings. `n` and `k` will be the last values read from the input. `k0` will be equal to the last value of `k`. `arr` will contain a list of integers from 0 to 255, as it iterates through all possible bit positions for the maximum `k`. `ans` will be constructed based on the values in `arr`, with each element being either a power of 2 or zero, depending on whether the corresponding bit in `k` was set. The list `ans` will be padded with zeros to ensure its length matches `n`. The final `ans` list will contain the calculated values based on the last `k0` and the constructed `arr`.
    #
    #The exact content of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n` and `k` for the last input, but it will follow the pattern described above.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR:**
   - The program constructs an array `arr` where each element `i` corresponds to a power of 2 (`1 << i`).
   - It iterates through `k` and checks if the least significant bit of `k` is set (`k & 1 == 1`). If it is, it appends the current index `i` to `arr`.
   - This process effectively creates a list of indices corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Constructing the Output Array:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` and a counter `c` to keep track of how many elements have been added to `ans`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and appends `1 << i` to `ans` for each index `i` in `arr`.
   - If `c` reaches `n-1`, it calculates the remaining value needed to reach the sum `k` and appends it to `ans`.
   - Finally, it pads `ans` with zeros to ensure its length is `n`.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 5`
  - Binary representation of `5`: `101` (two 1s at positions 0 and 2).
  - `arr` will contain `[0, 2]`.
  - `ans` will be `[1, 4]` (since `1 << 0` is `1` and `1 << 2` is `4`).
  - Since `n=1`, the final `ans` will be `[4]`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 3`
  - Binary representation of `3`: `11` (one 1 at position 0 and one 1 at position 1).
  - `arr` will contain `[0, 1]`.
  - `ans` will be `[1, 2]` (since `1 << 0` is `1` and `1 << 1` is `2`).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2 5`
  - Binary representation of `5`: `101` (two 1s at positions 0 and 2).
  - `arr` will contain `[0, 2]`.
  - `ans` will be `[1, 4]` (since `1 << 0` is `1` and `1 << 2` is `4`).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `6 51`
  - Binary representation of `51`: `110011` (three 1s at positions 0, 2, and 5).
  - `arr` will contain `[0, 2, 5]`.
  - `ans` will be `[1, 4, 32, 0, 0, 0]` (since `1 << 0` is `1`, `1 << 2` is `4`, and `1 << 5` is `32`).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs the sequence of integers that satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement. It ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation and that the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
