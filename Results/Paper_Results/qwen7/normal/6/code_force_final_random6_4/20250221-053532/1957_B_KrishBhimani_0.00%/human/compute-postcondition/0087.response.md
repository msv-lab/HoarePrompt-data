Postcondition: **`i` must be one of the values in `arr` = [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191]. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `k0` is defined and `ans` is a list with a new element `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `c` does not equal `n - 1`, no changes occur to `k0` or `ans`.**
