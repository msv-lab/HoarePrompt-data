Output State: **`i` is 1, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3]`**

Explanation: The code appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1]`. The sum of these elements is `1 + (k0 - 1) + 1 = k0 + 1`. Therefore, the new element to be appended is `k0 - (k0 + 1) = -1`. So, the updated `ans` list becomes `[1, k0 - 1, 1, -1]`. However, since the initial state mentions `ans` as `[1, k0 - 1, 1]`, and no specific value for `k0` is given, we keep it as `k0 - 1` and adjust accordingly, resulting in `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3]`. Variables `i` and `c` remain unchanged.
