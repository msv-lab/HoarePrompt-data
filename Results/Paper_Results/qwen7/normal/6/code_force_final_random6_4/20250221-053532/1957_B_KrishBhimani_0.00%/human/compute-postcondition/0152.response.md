Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `arr` contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`
   - `i` is the next element in `arr`
   - `c` is 1
   - `ans` contains `[0, -1, 2]`

3. **Determine the Next Element in `arr`**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `arr` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` has been incremented or updated to the next value in the list.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `arr` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `i` will now be the next element in `arr`.
   - `c` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Given that `i` is the next element in `arr`, the next value of `i` would be the first element of `arr` if it was the last element before the loop started. However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can infer that `i` will be the next value in the list.

Since `arr` is a list of integers from 0 to 15, and assuming `i` was the last element before the loop started (which is 15), the next value of `i` would be the first element of the list, which is 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is 0, `c` is 1, `ans` contains [0, -1, 2]**
