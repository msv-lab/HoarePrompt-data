Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while k:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `k` is non-zero.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is now half of its original value.
   - `arr` contains the integers `i` and `i+1`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends solely on the variable `k`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `k` is now half of its original value, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero. Given that `k` is already half of its original value, it should still be non-zero unless it has reached zero during the previous iterations. However, since no specific information about reaching zero is given, we assume `k` is still non-zero.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` should be non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` must be non-zero, `arr` contains the integers `i` and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1**.
