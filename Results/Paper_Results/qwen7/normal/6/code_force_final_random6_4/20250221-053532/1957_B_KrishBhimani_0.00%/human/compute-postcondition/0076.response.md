Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 3, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5, and `k` is now `k0` right-shifted by 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the bits of `k` to the right by 1 position, effectively dividing `k` by 2. Since `k0` is the original value of `k`, `k` is now `k0` divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
