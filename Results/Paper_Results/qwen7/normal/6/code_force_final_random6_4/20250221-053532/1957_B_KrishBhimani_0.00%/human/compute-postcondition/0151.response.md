Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is 1, `ans` contains [0, -1, 2**i]**.

Explanation: The code appends `1 << i` (which is equivalent to `2**i`) to the list `ans`. Since `i` is the next element in `arr` and `arr` starts from 0, the first value of `i` is 0. Therefore, `1 << 0` equals `2**0`, which is `1`. So, `ans` now contains `[0, -1, 1]`. However, the problem statement mentions that `ans` initially contains `[0, -1]`, implying that `i` was already set to 1 before this line of code was executed, making `1 << 1` equal to `2**1`, which is `2`. Thus, the updated `ans` is `[0, -1, 2]`. Given the exact sequence, the correct output state is with `2` appended to `ans`.
