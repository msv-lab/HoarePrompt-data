Output State: **`i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1]`**

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, and `ans` is a list with the element `1` appended to it. The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains only the element `1`, `sum(ans)` is `1`. Therefore, the value appended to `ans` is `k0 - 1`. The variables `i` and `c` remain unchanged. Thus, the updated state is as described.
