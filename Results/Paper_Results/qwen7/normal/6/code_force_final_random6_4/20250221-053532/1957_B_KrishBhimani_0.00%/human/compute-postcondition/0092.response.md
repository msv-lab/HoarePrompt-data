Output State: **`i` is 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `c`, or `ans`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, the variables retain their initial states.
