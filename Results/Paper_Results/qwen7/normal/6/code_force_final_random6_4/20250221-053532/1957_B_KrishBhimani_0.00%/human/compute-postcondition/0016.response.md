Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0 >> 1) and k0 must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1, `i` is 2, `k` is adjusted to be even by adding 1 if it was odd.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the bits of `k` to the right by one position, effectively dividing `k` by 2. Since `k` is initially `k0 >> 1`, shifting `k` to the right by one more position means `k` is now half of its original value (k0 >> 1). Additionally, if `k` was odd, it is adjusted to be even by adding 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
