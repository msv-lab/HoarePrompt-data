### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift of a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads a binary string `s` as a list of integers.
   - It iterates through the list and counts the number of consecutive '1's (`n`).
   - When a '0' is encountered and there have been at least one '1' before it, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`, which represents the cost of shifting the '1's to the beginning of the string.
   - This logic seems to be incorrect because it does not account for the actual positions of '1's and '0's in the string and how to achieve a sorted string efficiently.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - However, `func_1()` is designed to handle a single binary string, not multiple test cases. Therefore, calling `func_1()` inside `func_2()` for each test case will not work as intended.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the boundaries between '1's and '0's in the string and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all '1's to the front.
   - A more efficient approach would involve identifying the longest prefix of '1's and then calculating the cost of moving the rest of the '0's to the end.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1()` does not accurately calculate the minimum cost, and `func_2()` incorrectly calls `func_1()` for each test case without handling the input properly.

### Correctness:
**False**
