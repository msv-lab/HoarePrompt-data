State: **`t` must be at least 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable inside the loop, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution condition.
3. The only variable that determines whether the loop will execute is `t`.
4. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be at least 1.
