Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, a binary string `s` is provided where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. It does not affect the binary strings `s` for each test case, which are yet to be provided. Therefore, the initial conditions for `s` remain unchanged.
