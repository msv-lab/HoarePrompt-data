### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the input should be a binary string.
   - It splits the input into a list of integers, which is incorrect for a binary string.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts.
   - Specifically, the function sums up the lengths of segments of '1's and '0's, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach would involve identifying segments of '0's and calculating the cost of cyclic shifts to move these segments to the end of the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify segments of '0's and '1's and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all '1's to the beginning of the string.
   - For each segment of '0's between two '1's, the cost is the length of the segment plus the length of the segment of '1's before it.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points, but the implementation itself is flawed.
   - The variable `s` is expected to be a binary string, but it is being treated as a list of integers, which is incorrect.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not account for the correct calculation of the minimum cost for cyclic shifts.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts.
