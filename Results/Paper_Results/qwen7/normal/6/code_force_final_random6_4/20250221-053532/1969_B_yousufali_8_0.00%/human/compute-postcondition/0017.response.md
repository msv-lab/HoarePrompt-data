Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is two more than the previous value, `n` is one more than its previous value, `ans` is the value of `n + 1` added to `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += n + 1` increments `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` are updated according to their previous definitions, but no new values are provided for them. Therefore, `i` remains two more than the previous value, `n` remains one more than its previous value, and `ans` is updated by adding `n + 1` to its current value.
