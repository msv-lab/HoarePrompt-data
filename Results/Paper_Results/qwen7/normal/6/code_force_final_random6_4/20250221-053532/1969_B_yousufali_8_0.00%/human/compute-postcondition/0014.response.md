Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is two more than the previous value, `n` is one more than its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since `i` is defined as being one more than the previous value of `n`, it now becomes two more than the previous value. The list `s` remains unchanged.
