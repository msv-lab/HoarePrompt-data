Output State: **`s` is a list of integers, `i` is three more than the previous value, `n` is one more than its previous value if the condition is not met, otherwise two more than the previous value.**

Explanation: The code `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n` or the condition under which `n` would be incremented by 2 instead of 1, we can only say that `n` is one more than its previous value if the condition is not met, otherwise it is two more than the previous value. The value of `i` remains three more than the previous value because the code snippet does not affect `i`.
