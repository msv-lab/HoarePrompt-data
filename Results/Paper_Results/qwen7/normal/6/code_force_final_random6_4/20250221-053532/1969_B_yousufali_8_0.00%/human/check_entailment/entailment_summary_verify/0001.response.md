### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to take a binary string as input, but it currently takes a list of integers. This is incorrect according to the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts. It simply counts the number of '0's followed by '1's without considering the actual cost of cyclic shifts.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all '1's to the beginning of the string.
   - For each segment of '0's between two '1's, the cost is the length of the segment plus the length of the segment of '1's before it.

5. **Function Summaries**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` mentions that it processes a specified number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, it does not mention that `func_1` is supposed to handle binary strings.
   - The summary for `func_1` does not provide any useful information about its intended behavior or the correct way to calculate the cost.

6. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_1` is incorrectly implemented and that `func_2` will produce incorrect results due to this.
   - However, the original assessment does not provide a detailed explanation of why `func_1` is incorrect or how to fix it.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
