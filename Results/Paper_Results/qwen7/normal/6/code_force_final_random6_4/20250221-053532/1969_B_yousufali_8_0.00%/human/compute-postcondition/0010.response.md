Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with the current value of `s[i]` being 0, `n` is not 0, and `ans` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += n + 1` increments the value of `ans` by `n + 1`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is incremented by 1 if the value of `s[i]` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is 0, `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `n + 1`. The values of `s` and `n` remain as per their initial conditions, and `ans` is now `n + 1`.
