Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers, `i` is two more than the previous value, `n` is one more than its previous value. If `s[i]` equals 0 and `n` is not 0, then `i` is incremented by one, `n` is incremented by one, and `ans` is updated by adding `n + 1` to its current value. If the condition `s[i] == 0 and n != 0` is not met, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
