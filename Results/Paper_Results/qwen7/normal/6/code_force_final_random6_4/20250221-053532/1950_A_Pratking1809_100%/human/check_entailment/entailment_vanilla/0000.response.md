### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The condition `a < b < c` is correctly checked to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - **Peak Condition**: The condition `a < b > c` is correctly checked to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - **None Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program correctly prints "NONE".
4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case based on the conditions.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all possible cases as specified, it should work correctly for the given input constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
