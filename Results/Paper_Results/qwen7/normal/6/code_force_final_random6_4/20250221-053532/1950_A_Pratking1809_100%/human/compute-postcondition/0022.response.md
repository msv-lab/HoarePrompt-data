Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(q):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `q`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `q` remains greater than `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `q` must still be greater than `i + 1`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, `q` must now be greater than `(i + 1) + 1` or simply `i + 2`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as integers entered by the user.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `q` must be greater than `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `i` is incremented by 1, and `q` must be greater than `i + 2`**.
