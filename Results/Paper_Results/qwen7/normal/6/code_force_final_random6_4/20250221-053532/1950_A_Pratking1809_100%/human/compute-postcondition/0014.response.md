Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `q`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < q`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The postcondition given is about the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` but does not directly affect the loop execution.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was less than `q`, and now `i` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was previously less than `q`, it will still be less than `q` unless `i` equals `q-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `q`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `q`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `i` is `i + 1`, and `q` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
