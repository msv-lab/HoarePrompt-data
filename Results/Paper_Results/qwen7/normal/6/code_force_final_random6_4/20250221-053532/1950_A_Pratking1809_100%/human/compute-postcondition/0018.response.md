Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.
   - `i` is defined as `i + 1`, but since `i` is not initialized before this line, it results in a NameError because `i` is not defined.
   - `q` must be greater than `i + 1`, but again, since `i` is not defined, this condition cannot be evaluated.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('NONE')
   ```

Given the initial state, the key point here is that the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NONE'`. The other variables (`i` and `q`) are not relevant to the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement itself does not reference them.

Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
