Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to iterate over the number of test cases specified in the first line of input.
2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the inputs for each test case, including \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
3. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation**: The program correctly accumulates the sum of friendship values (\( a \)) from the given pairs.
4. **Constant \( c \) Calculation**: The constant \( c \) is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( M \). This is correct because \( c \) is used to scale the expected values appropriately.
5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value calculation seems to be incorrect. The formula used in the program is:
   \[
   s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a
   \]
   However, the expected value for the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of the friendship value increasing over time. The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion and summing these expectations.
6. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \( M \), which is correct.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The provided formula for \( s \) does not accurately represent the expected value calculation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
