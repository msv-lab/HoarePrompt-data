Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `M` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. The value of `c` is computed using the formula `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`, which finds the number `c` such that `(n * (n - 1) // 1) * c â‰¡ 1 (mod M)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
