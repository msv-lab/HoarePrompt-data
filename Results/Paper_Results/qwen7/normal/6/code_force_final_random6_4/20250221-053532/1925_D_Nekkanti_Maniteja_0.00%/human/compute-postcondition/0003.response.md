Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` remain unchanged from their initial states. The calculation of `c` depends on the specific values of `n` and `M`, but the exact value of `c` is not specified without knowing the exact value of `n`.
