Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `u` is an integer entered by the user, `v` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is `a` plus `f`.**

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `a` is now `a + f`.
