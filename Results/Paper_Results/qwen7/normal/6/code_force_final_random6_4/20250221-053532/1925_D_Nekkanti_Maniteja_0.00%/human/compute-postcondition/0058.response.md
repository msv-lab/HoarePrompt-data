Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `M`, `s`, and `a` remain unchanged.
