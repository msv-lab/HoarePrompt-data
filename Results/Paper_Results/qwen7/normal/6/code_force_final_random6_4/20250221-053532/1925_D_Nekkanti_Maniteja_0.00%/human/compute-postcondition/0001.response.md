Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the specified range, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are the integers obtained from the input.
