Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `1000000007`, `M` is `1000000007`, `s` is `0`, `a` is increased by `f`, `u` is the second integer from the split input, `v` is the third integer from the split input, `f` is the first integer from the split input, `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned the values from the split input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and splits them into `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `M`, `s`, `a`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
