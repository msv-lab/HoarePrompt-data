Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is less than `m`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as inputs during the loop executions.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `i` will still be less than `m` because the loop condition checks if `i` is less than `m` and increments `i` within each iteration. The variables `k`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `M`, `s`, and `a` will retain their initial values except for `a`, which will be incremented by the sum of all `f` values provided as inputs during the loop executions.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is `c * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is `c * c * m + 2 * c * m + 2 * c * a + c * a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
