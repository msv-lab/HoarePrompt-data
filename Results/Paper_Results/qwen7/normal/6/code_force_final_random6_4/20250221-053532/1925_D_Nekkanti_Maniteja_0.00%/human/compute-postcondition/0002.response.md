Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `M` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which evaluates to `1000000007`. This value is stored in the variable `M`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were obtained from the input split by spaces.
