Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `test` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(test):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a + b & 1 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `test` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `t` is 0, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or odd depending on the condition in the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `t` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and after executing the if-else block, if `a + b` is even, the program continues with the next steps. If `a + b` is odd, the program also continues with the next steps.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `t` is 2, `a` and `b` are the values of two integers split from the input, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged regardless of the condition in the if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
