Output State: **`test` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `test` ≤ 1000.**

The code `test = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `test`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the same condition applies to `test` after the code execution. All other variables remain unchanged, and the only new information is that `test` now holds the value of the input integer.
