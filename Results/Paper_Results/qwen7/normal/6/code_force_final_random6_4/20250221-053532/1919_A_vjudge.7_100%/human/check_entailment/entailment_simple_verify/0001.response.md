### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob can always force the sum to become odd after his turn, ensuring Alice eventually faces an even sum and thus loses.
   - If the sum of the coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice can always force the sum to become even after her turn, ensuring Bob eventually faces an odd sum and thus loses.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
     - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - However, the program does not simulate the actual game process. Instead, it makes a decision based on the parity of the sum without considering the sequence of moves or the optimal strategy of the players.
   - The program assumes that the players will always make the optimal move, but it does not verify this assumption through the game logic itself. It simply checks the parity of the sum and prints the result accordingly.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Let's consider the first test case where `a = 1` and `b = 1`.
     - The sum `a + b = 2` (even), so the program prints 'Bob'.
     - According to the game rules, Alice cannot make a move since her wallet is empty, and Bob wins.
   - Let's consider the second test case where `a = 1` and `b = 4`.
     - The sum `a + b = 5` (odd), so the program prints 'Alice'.
     - According to the game rules, Alice can force the sum to be even after her turn, and Bob eventually faces an even sum and loses.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins.
   - However, the program does not simulate the game process to ensure that the players are indeed playing optimally. It only checks the parity and prints the result based on that.
   - The original assessment correctly states that the program is correct in determining the winner based on the parity of the sum, but it does not account for the fact that the program does not simulate the game process.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins, which aligns with the optimal strategy of the players. However, the program does not simulate the game process to ensure that the players are playing optimally. The original assessment accurately reflects this, and the program is correct in its logic.
