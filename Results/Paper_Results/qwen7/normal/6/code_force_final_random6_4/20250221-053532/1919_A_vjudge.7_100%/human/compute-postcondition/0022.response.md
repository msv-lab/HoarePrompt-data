Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases through a loop where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each `t`, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it processes `a` and `b` based on the value of `t` and returns a result accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `a`, and `b`. It processes these values according to some unspecified logic related to `t`, `a`, and `b`, and returns a result for each test case.
