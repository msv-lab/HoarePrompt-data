Postcondition: **`test` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `t` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and after executing the if-else block, if `a + b` is even, the program continues with the next steps. If `a + b` is odd, the program also continues with the next steps.**
