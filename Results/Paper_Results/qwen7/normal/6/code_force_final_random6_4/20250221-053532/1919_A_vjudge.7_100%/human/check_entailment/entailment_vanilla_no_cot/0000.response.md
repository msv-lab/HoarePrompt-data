Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Game Analysis**: 
   - Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - If both players play optimally, the key observation is that the player whose turn it is when the total number of coins (sum of `a` and `b`) is even will lose because they will eventually be forced into a situation where they cannot make a valid move.

2. **Parity Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob' because Bob will win if the sum is even.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice' because Alice will win if the sum is odd.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calculates the sum, and prints the result based on the parity check.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
