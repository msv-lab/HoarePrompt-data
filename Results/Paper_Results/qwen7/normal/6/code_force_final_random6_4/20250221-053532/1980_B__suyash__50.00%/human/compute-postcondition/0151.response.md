Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the third element of list `b` to variable `k`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` now holds the value of the third element of list `b`.
