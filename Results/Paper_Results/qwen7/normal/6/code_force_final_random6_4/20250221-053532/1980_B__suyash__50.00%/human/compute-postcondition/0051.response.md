Output State: **`fav` is an integer, `i` is `i_end + 1`, `l` is a list of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables `fav`, `i`, `l`, or `k`, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
