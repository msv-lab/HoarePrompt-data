Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that `i` and `k` are part of. The values of `i` and `k` are updated before the `break` statement is executed, so those updates are kept. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
