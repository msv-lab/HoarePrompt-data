Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(l)`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `l`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `fav == l[i]` or not.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]` at the end of each iteration, so for the next iteration, `k` should be `k - dic[l[i]]`.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop does not affect the state of `i` or `k` directly, but it ensures that the loop will exit if the condition is met. However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to explicitly mention this condition.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `k` will be `k - dic[l[i]]`.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - dic[l[i]]`**.
