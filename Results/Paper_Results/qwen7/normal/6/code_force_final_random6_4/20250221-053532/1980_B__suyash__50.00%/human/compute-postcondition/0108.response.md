Output State: **`fav` is not equal to `l[i]`; `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `k` is being decremented by `dic[l[i]]`. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables outside of the loop or conditional block, the conditions involving `fav`, `l[i]`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, `fav` is still not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is still greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
