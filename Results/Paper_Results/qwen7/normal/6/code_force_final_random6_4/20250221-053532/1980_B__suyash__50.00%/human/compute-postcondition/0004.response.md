Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split()**.

Explanation: The code `o = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `o`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
