Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input string from the user.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer.
- `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split().
- `n` is the first element of the list `b`.
- `f` is the second element of the list `b`.
- `k` is the third element of the list `b`.
- The value of `k` is equal to the value of `n`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without any dependence on the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
