Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `i` or `k`. The values of `i` and `k` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed, which are `i + 1` and `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]`, respectively.
