Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer.**

This means that the variable `t` retains its initial state as an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` remains unchanged at 0, `a` is still the input string from the user, and `b` is now a list of integers derived from splitting the string `a` and converting each resulting substring to an integer.
