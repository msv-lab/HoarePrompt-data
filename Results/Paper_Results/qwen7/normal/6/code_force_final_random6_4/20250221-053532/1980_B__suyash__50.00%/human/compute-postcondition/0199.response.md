Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` is `k - 2 * dic[l[i]]`: Here, `k` is updated by subtracting twice the value of `dic[l[i]]` from its current value. However, since `l` and `dic` are not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
