Postcondition: **`r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
