Output State: **j is n - 1, f is 0.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be set to `n - 1`, and the variable `f` will be 0. This means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and at some point within the loop, the condition `num[j] != num[j + 1]` was met, causing the loop to break. The value of `f` being 0 indicates that the loop did indeed break due to finding a pair of consecutive elements in the list `num` that are not equal.
