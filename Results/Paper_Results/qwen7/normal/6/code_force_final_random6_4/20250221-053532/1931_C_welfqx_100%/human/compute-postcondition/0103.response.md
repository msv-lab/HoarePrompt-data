Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum`. Since `onum` was initially a copy of `num`, after reversing `onum`, `onum` now contains the reversed elements of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.
