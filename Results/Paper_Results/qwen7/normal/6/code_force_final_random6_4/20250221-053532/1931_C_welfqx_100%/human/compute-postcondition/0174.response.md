Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
