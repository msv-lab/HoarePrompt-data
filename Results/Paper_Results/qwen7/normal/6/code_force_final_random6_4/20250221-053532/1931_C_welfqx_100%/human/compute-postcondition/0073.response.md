Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ii` will be `n-2`, and `ck` will be the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `onum` that are the same. Specifically, `ck` will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `onum` are identical. If there are no consecutive identical elements, `ck` will be 0. The value of `n` will remain unchanged, and the other variables (`r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) will retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations. Additionally, within the if condition, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.**
