Output State: **`cn` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, the current value of `num` is such that the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`.**

The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. The conditions and values of `n` and `num` remain unchanged from the initial state.
