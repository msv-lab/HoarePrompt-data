Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array that allows checking consecutive elements without exiting prematurely, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. If `onum[0]` is equal to `onum[1]`, then `cn` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop or if-else block is exited.**
