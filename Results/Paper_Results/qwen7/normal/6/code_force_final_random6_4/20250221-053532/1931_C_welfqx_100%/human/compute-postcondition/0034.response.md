Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `j` equals `n-1`, `onum` is the reversed version of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `num` to the variable `symb1`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
