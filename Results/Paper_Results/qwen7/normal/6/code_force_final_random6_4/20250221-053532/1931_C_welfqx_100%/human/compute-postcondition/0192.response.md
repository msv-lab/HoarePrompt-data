Output State: **`cn` is 1, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cn` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since it is only incremented by 1). The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid.
