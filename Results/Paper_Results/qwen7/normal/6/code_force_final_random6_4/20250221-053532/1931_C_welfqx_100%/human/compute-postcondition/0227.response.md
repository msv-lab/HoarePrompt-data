Based on the initial state provided:

- `cn` is equal to `symb1 + symb2`
- `ck` remains unchanged (though the exact value of `ck` is not specified)

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate `max(cn, ck)`:

- `cn` is explicitly defined as `symb1 + symb2`
- `ck` remains unchanged but its exact value is not provided

Therefore, `max(cn, ck)` will be either `symb1 + symb2` if `symb1 + symb2 >= ck`, or `ck` if `symb1 + symb2 < ck`.

The expression `n - max(cn, ck)` will then subtract the maximum of these two values from `n`.

Given this, the output will depend on the relationship between `symb1 + symb2` and `ck`, but it will always be `n` minus the larger of the two values `symb1 + symb2` and `ck`.

Output: **n - max(symb1 + symb2, ck)**
