Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: The code takes an input string from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `num`. The variables `r`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
