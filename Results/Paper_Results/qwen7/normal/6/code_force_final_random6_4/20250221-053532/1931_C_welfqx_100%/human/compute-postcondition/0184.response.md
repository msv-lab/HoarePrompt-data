Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.
   - The loop head also contains the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 (i.e., `n >= 1`).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `j` (`n - 1`) is derived from `n`, but since the loop condition depends directly on `n`, we need to focus on `n`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
