Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and `j` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions, these remain unchanged except for the indication of breaking out of the loop or conditional structure.
