Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `j` equals `n-1`, `onum` is the reversed version of `num`, `cn` is 1.**

The code `cn = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `cn`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
