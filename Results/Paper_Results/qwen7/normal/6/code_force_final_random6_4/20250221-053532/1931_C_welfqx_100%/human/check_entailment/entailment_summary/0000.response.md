Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `0` since no operations are needed.
3. If not all elements are the same, the program calculates the maximum length of consecutive identical elements in both the original and reversed arrays.
4. The logic for calculating the maximum length of consecutive identical elements is correct. It iterates through the array to find the longest sequence of identical elements starting from the beginning (`cn`) and from the end (`ck`).
5. If the first element of the original array is the same as the first element of the reversed array, it adds these two lengths together to get the total length of the longest sequence of identical elements.
6. Finally, the program prints the difference between the array size `n` and the maximum length of consecutive identical elements, which gives the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
