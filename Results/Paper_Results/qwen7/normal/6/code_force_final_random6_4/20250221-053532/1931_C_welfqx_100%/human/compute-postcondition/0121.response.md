Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop condition is `i < n - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n - 2` and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be `n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented from `n - 2` to `n - 1`.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true for the next iteration.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be `n - 1`.
- `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is `n - 1`**.
