Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ii` will be `n-2`, `ck` will be the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `onum` that are the same, and `cn` will be incremented by `ck`. The value of `n` will remain unchanged, and the other variables (`r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) will retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations. Additionally, within the if condition, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ii` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array where all elements from index 0 to `n-2` are checked for consecutive identical elements, `cn` is the total count of consecutive identical elements found during the entire loop execution, the loop has checked all elements up to the second last one, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cn` is equal to `symb1 + symb2`, and `ck` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
