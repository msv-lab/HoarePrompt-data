Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and an array a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each case involves a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` positive integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific result for each test case, adhering to the constraints provided.
