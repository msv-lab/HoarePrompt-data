You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and num2 is not used and can be ignored as it does not appear in the problem description or the function definition.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `order` will be the count of consecutive elements in the list `a` where each element is less than or equal to the previous one. The variable `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `num2` must be greater than 1. The values of `a` and `num2` will remain unchanged from their initial values, but `order` will reflect the number of such consecutive pairs found in the list `a`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `order` will be the number of times an element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to its predecessor, starting from the second element up to the second-to-last element. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `num2`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements it was supposed to, and `order` will show how many times the specified condition was met.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if no consecutive elements in the list are greater than the previous one (starting from the second element), otherwise it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`case`).

2. **Array Conversion:**
   - The array elements are split and converted to integers using list comprehension.
   - This part seems correct and necessary.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program then calculates the beauty of the array by summing up `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Sorting and Rearrangement:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum beauty by rearranging the array.
   - Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` are minimized, which maximizes the overall beauty.

2. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - The calculation `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1` is correct.
   - This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the highest possible beauty.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the array is already sorted (returns `0`).
   - It also handles cases where the array needs to be rearranged (calculates the beauty correctly).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it in ascending order and then calculating the beauty. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
