Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, num2):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `num2`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `order` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `num2` must be greater than 1

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num2`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `num2` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `order` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `num2` must still be greater than 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`order` is 1, `i` is 2, `num2` must be greater than 1**
