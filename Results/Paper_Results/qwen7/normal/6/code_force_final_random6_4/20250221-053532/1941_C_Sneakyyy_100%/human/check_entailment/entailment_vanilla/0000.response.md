### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from the string `s` to eliminate the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The provided function iterates through the string and checks for the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function takes an integer `t` as input, which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `a` and the string itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of deletions needed.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string up to the third last character (`len(a) - 2`).
   - In each iteration, it checks the substring of length 3 starting at index `i`.
   - If the substring is "pie" or "map", it increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it increments `i` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles overlapping substrings because it always moves `i` by 3 when it finds "pie" or "map".
   - It also correctly handles cases where the string does not contain "pie" or "map" by setting `ans` to 0.
   - The function correctly handles the end of the string by stopping the loop at `len(a) - 2`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the function is sound and correctly counts the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
   - The function handles all specified edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
