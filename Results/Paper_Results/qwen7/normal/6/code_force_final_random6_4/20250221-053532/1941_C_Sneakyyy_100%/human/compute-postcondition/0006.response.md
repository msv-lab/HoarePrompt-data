Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 1 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the string `a` starting from index `i` (which is initially 0) up to index `i + 3`. Since `i` is 0, `s` will be the substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having a length of 3. However, since `i` is incremented after this line, its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
