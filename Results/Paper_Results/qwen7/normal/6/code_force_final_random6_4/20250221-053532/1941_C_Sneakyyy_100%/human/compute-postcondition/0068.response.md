Output State: **`ans` is 0, `a` is a new string input by the user, `i` is the final index value where the loop terminated, and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `a`, `i`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
