Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases where the string needs to be shortened. Specifically, it only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in chunks of three characters at a time, but it fails to account for overlapping occurrences and other relevant cases.

For example, consider the string "ppiee". The current implementation would not detect that this string should have one character removed to become "piee" (which is beautiful), because it only checks for "pie" starting from the beginning of the string.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we properly handle overlapping substrings and correctly count the minimum deletions required. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if a[i:i+3] == 'pie' or a[i:i+3] == 'map':
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters since we found a match
            elif a[i] == 'p' and (i+2 < len(a) and a[i+1:i+3] == 'ie'):
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters since we found a match
            elif a[i] == 'm' and (i+2 < len(a) and a[i+1:i+3] == 'ap'):
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters since we found a match
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This updated function ensures that all occurrences of "pie" and "map" are correctly identified and counted, even when they overlap or are part of larger substrings.
