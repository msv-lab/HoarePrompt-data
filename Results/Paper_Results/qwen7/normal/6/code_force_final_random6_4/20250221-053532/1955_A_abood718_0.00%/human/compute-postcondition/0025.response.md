Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
- `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
- `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
- `X` is `A // 2` if `A` is even, otherwise `X` remains undefined.

The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of `A` and `B`.

Since `A` and `B` are the first and second non-negative integers within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), they must be 1 and 2 respectively (assuming the smallest possible values).

Therefore, the product `A * B` is \(1 * 2 = 2\).

Output: **2**
