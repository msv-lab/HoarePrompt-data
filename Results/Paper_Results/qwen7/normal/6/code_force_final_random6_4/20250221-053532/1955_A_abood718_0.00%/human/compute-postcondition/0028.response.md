Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the first non-negative integer, `A` is 1.
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the second non-negative integer, `B` is 2.
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). Since it is the third non-negative integer, `C` is 3.
   - `X` is `A // 2` if `A` is even, otherwise `X` is undefined. Here, `A` is 1, which is odd. Therefore, `X` is undefined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(X)
   ```

Given that `X` is undefined, the print statement will output `None` (the default value for an undefined variable in Python).

Output: **None**
