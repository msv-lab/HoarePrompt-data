Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(X)
   ```

Given this information, let's determine what `X` will be:

- `X` is defined as `A // 2`, which means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.

Since the exact value of `A` is not specified in the initial state, `X` will be the integer division of `A` by 2.

Therefore, the output will be the integer division of `A` by 2.

Output: **A // 2**
