Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input, `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input, `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input, and the condition `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remains unchanged. If `A` is even, `X` is `A // 2`; otherwise, `X` is undefined.**
