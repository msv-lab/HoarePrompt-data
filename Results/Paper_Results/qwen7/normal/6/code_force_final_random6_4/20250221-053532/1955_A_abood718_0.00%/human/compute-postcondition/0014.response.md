Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
   - If `B * 2 < C`, then `B * 2 < C` still holds.
   - Otherwise, if `A` is even, `A` remains unchanged and `B * 2 >= C` holds.
   - If `A` is odd, `A` is replaced by `A // 2` and `B * 2 >= C` still holds.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(int(input()))`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

4. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `i`, `A`, `B`, `C`, and `t`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The values of `A`, `B`, `C`, and `t` remain unchanged unless modified inside the loop body, but since no modifications are specified in the loop body, they stay the same.

6. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains as it is (an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\))
   - `i` becomes 1
   - `A` remains the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
   - `B` remains the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
   - `C` remains the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)
   - The conditions `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and the condition `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remains unchanged.**
