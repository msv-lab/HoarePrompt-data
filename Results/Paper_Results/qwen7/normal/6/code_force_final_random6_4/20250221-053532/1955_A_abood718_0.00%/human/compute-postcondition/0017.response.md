Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is set to 1.
   - `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\) based on the current input.
   - The condition `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int(A * C / 2))
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`. Since these values are derived from the current input and the condition `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C` based on the value of `A` remains unchanged, let's assume a specific scenario for clarity:

- Suppose the input sequence is `1, 2, 3` (this is a common assumption to simplify the problem without loss of generality).

- Therefore:
  - `A = 1`
  - `B = 2`
  - `C = 3`

- Check the condition: `B * 2 < C` or `B * 2 >= C`
  - `2 * 2 = 4` and `4 >= 3`, so the condition `B * 2 >= C` holds true.

Now, we substitute these values into the print statement:
```python
print(int(1 * 3 / 2))
```

This simplifies to:
```python
print(int(3 / 2))
```

Since `3 / 2` is `1.5`, and we take the integer part, it becomes `1`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **1**
