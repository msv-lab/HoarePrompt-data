You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until all input test cases are processed. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, where `t` is the total number of test cases. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` will be updated according to the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, if `A` is even, it will be halved; if `A` is odd, it will be halved and then `B * 2 >= C` will hold. The final output will consist of the results printed during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers A, B, and C. For each test case, it prints one or two values based on specific conditions. If B * 2 is less than C, it prints A * B. If A is even, it prints int(A * C / 2). If A is odd, it prints A // 2 followed by A // 2 * C + B. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation**:
   - The program checks if the promotion price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the regular price (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price `B`. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means the promotion is beneficial. The program then proceeds to calculate the minimum cost using the promotion.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the total cost as `(A / 2) * C`, which is the cost of buying `A / 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` is odd, the program first buys as many pairs as possible (i.e., `X = A // 2` pairs), and then buys the remaining one yogurt at the regular price `B`.
   - The total cost is calculated as `X * C + B`.

### Detailed Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 9`, so `B * 2 > C`.
  - Since `A` is even, the total cost is `(2 / 2) * 9 = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (Correct).

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 9`, so `B * 2 > C`.
  - Since `A` is odd, the total cost is `(3 // 2) * 9 + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20` (but the expected output is `14`).
  - The program outputs `14` instead of `15 + 5 = 20` because it prints `X` and then `X * C + B` separately, but the logic for odd `A` should directly compute the total cost.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 11`, so `B * 2 < C`.
  - Since `A` is odd, the total cost is `(3 // 2) * 11 + 5 = 16 + 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (Correct).

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` and `C = 11`, so `B * 2 < C`.
  - Since `A` is even, the total cost is `(4 / 2) * 11 = 22`.
  - Output: `20` (Incorrect due to the same issue as Test Case 2).

### Conclusion:
The program has an issue with handling the odd number of yogurts correctly. It should directly compute the total cost for odd `A` without printing intermediate values.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + max(B, C - B))
```
