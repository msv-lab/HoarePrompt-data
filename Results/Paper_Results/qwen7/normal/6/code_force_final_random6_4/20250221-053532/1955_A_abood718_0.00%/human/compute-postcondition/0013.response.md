Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). If `B * 2 < C`, then `B * 2 < C` still holds. Otherwise, if `A` is even, `A` remains unchanged and `B * 2 >= C` holds. If `A` is odd, `A` is replaced by `A // 2` and `B * 2 >= C` still holds.**
