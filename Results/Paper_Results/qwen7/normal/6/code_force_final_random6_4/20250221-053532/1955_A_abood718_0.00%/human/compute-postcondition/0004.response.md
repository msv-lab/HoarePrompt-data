Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `A` is the first non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), `B` is the second non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\), and `C` is the third non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\). The condition \(B * 2 \geq C\) holds true.**
