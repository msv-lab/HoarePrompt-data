Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). It does not specify a direct return value but suggests processing each test case and potentially returning results for each based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific integers, and for each test case, it performs some operation based on these integers. The exact nature of the operation is not specified, but it involves checking the range of the integers and possibly returning results for each test case.
