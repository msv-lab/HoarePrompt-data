Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Given the initial state where `cnt[c]` is increased by 1, the code snippet checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If it is, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. Since `cnt[c]` was initially increased by 1, `cnt[1]` could be greater than 0 depending on the value of `c`. However, without knowing the exact value of `c`, we can only say that if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
