Output State: **`ans` is 1, `cnt` is {0: 1, 1: 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}, `zeroes` is 0**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `ans` is 1.
- `cnt` is a dictionary with keys 0, 1, 'b', 'c' and their respective counts.
- `s` is a string "abc".
- The code updates `ans` by adding the value of `zeroes` (which is 0) to `ans`. Since `zeroes` is not defined before this line, it is assumed to be 0. Therefore, `ans` remains 1.
- The dictionary `cnt` and the string `s` remain unchanged.
