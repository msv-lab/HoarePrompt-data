Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the input as a list of integers instead of a binary string. This will cause issues when processing the string later.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of operations needed to sort the string in non-descending order.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the breakpoints where the sequence changes from 0 to 1 and vice versa. Each breakpoint indicates the start of a new segment that needs to be shifted. The cost of shifting a segment is equal to its length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    n = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    t = []
    for i in range(n):
        t.append(data[index])
        index += 1
    
    ans = 0
    zero_count = 0
    one_count = 0
    for i in range(len(t)):
        if t[i] == '0':
            zero_count += 1
        else:
            # Calculate cost for the previous segment of 0s
            ans += (i - one_count) * zero_count
            one_count = i + 1
    
    # Add cost for the last segment of 0s
    ans += (len(t) - one_count) * zero_count
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected program:
1. Reads the input properly.
2. Counts the segments of 0s and 1s.
3. Calculates the cost for each segment based on the number of 0s and their positions.
4. Outputs the minimum total cost to sort the string.
