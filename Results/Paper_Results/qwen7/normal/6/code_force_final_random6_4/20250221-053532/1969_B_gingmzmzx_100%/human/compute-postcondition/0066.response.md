Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for c in s`. The objects involved here are `c` (the variable used to iterate over each character in the string `s`) and `s` (the string itself).

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `cnt` is a list with two elements `[0, 0]`.
   - `ans` is an integer with a value of `0`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Once `s` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, `c` will take on the value of each character in `s` one by one.
   - For the loop to start executing, `s` must contain at least one character. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` and `c`. Specifically, `s` must contain at least one character, and `c` will be set to the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
