Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is [0, 1], `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `c` is the first element of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the first element of the list `s` (stored in `c`) in the list `cnt`. Initially, `cnt` is `[0, 0]`, meaning both elements are zero. After incrementing `cnt[c]` by 1, the first element of `cnt` becomes 1, making `cnt` equal to `[0, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
