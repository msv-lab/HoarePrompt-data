Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.**

The code counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s` and assigns the result to the variable `x`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
