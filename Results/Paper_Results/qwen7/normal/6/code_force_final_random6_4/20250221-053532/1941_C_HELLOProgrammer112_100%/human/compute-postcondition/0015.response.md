Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is equal to the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `a` is an input integer.**

The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
