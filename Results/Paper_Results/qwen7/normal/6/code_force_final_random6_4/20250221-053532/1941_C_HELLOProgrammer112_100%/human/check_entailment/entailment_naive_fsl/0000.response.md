Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping or nested substrings. For example, in the string "mapie", the program would count both "map" and "pie", but only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful. The program should focus on removing the minimum number of characters, not just counting occurrences.
