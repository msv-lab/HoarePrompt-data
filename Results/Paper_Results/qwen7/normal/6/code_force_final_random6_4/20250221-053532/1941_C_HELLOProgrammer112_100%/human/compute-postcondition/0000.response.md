Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range()` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - According to the problem statement, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This means the input value (which is `int(input())`) should be within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, the initial state must ensure that the input value is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
