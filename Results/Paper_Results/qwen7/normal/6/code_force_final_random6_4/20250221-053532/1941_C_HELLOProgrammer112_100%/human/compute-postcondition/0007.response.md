Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means that the loop will run based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `s` is an input string
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`
   - `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is based on the value of `int(input())`. This means that the loop will continue as long as the input is a positive integer within the specified range.
   - Since the loop head does not directly involve `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, or `z`, these values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The only thing that changes is the input value for the next iteration, which will determine if the loop continues.

Given that the loop will continue if the input is a positive integer within the specified range, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, the input for the next iteration must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
