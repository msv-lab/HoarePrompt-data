Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, and `numbers` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the last element is `n`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the next iteration. Given that `t` was greater than 1 before, it will still be greater than 0.

6. **Maintain other states**: The other variables (`n` and `numbers`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the last element is `n`**.
