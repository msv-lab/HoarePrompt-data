Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(10)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 10.

4. **Update the state of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4.

5. **Check if the loop condition is satisfied**: With `i` now being 4, the condition `i < 10` is still true, so the loop can execute again.

6. **Adjust other states**: No other states need to be adjusted since the only variable in the loop head is `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 4, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3]` is 4**
