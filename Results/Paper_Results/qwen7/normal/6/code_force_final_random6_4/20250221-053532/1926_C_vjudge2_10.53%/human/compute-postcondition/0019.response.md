Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 2, `values[0]` is 0, `sum_values[2]` is 1**

Explanation: The line `sum_values[i] = total` updates the value of `sum_values` at index `i` to be equal to `total`. Given that `total` is initially 1 and `i` is 2, `sum_values[2]` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
