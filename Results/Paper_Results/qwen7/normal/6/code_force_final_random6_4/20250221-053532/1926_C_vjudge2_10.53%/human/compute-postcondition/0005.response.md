Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in this loop are `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 (since each iteration of the loop reduces `t` by 1) and must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (because it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration and will be decremented by 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing `n`**.
