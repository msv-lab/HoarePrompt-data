Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The solution tries to precompute sums for all numbers up to `max(numbers)`, which is not necessary and inefficient. Instead, we need to compute the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` individually.

2. **Unnecessary Lists**: The lists `values` and `sum_values` are used in a way that does not align with the problem requirements. These lists are not being utilized correctly to solve the problem.

3. **Logic Error**: The logic inside the loop where the sum of digits is calculated is flawed. It incorrectly splits the number into the last digit and the remaining part, and then tries to use previously computed sums, which is not applicable here.

4. **Efficiency Issue**: The current approach has a time complexity of O(n * d), where `d` is the number of digits in the largest number, which can be inefficient for large `n`.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = sum(sum_of_digits(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Function `sum_of_digits`**: This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
2. **Main Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, reads the value of `n`.
   - Computes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
   - Prints the result for each test case.

This solution is more efficient and directly addresses the problem requirements without unnecessary precomputations or incorrect logic.
