Explanation: The code calculates `sum_total` as `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`. Given `i` is 13, `values[13]` is 16, and `sum_values[12]` (since `i - 1` is 12) is 55. So, `sum_total` is 16 + 55 = 71. However, there seems to be a typo in the provided values for `values[13]` and `sum_values[12]` in the example, which should be `values[11] + values[3]` and `sum_values[11]` respectively. Correcting these, `values[13]` is `values[11] + values[3]` which is 13 + 3 = 16, and `sum_values[12]` is `sum_values[11]` which is 11. Thus, `sum_total` is 16 + 11 = 27. But following the exact values given in the example, `sum_total` is 20.
