Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop index) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will always execute at least once if `t` is within this range.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means that `t` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `t` being an input integer within the specified range already ensures this condition. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

4. **Consider the Placeholder Variable**: The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution conditions. It is used to iterate `t` times, but its value is not relevant for determining the loop's execution.

5. **List Variable**: The `numbers` list is initially empty. The loop itself does not modify the `numbers` list directly, so no adjustments are needed for `numbers`.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be considered for ensuring the loop can execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
