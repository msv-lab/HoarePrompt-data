Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 2, `values[0]` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `total` was incremented by `i`, which initially was 1, resulting in `total` becoming 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
