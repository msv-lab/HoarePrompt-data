Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` for each test case. However, it initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, with a length based on the maximum value in the input integers plus one. This is unnecessary because the maximum value `n` itself is sufficient to cover all possible sums of digits up to `n`.

2. **Populating the `values` List**: The program correctly populates the `values` list for the first 10 integers and calculates their cumulative sums in the `sum_values` list. This part is correct.

3. **Updating `values` and `sum_values` Lists**: The issue arises here. The program attempts to update the `values` and `sum_values` lists based on the last digit and the remaining part of each integer `n`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly compute the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n`. Instead, it tries to build a dynamic programming solution which is not appropriate for this problem.

4. **Final Calculation and Output**: The program then prints the cumulative sum corresponding to each integer `n` from the input. This step is also incorrect because the `values` and `sum_values` lists are not updated in a way that reflects the actual sum of digits for each number from 1 to `n`.

A correct approach would involve iterating through each number from 1 to `n`, calculating the sum of its digits, and accumulating these sums. The provided code does not implement this logic correctly.

Correctness: **False**
