Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is in the range from 10 to `n` (inclusive).
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 45
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be at least 10
   - `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements
   - `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0
   - `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0
   - `i` is 12
   - `values[0]` is 0
   - `values[3]` is 3
   - `values[4]` is 4
   - `values[5]` is 5
   - `values[6]` is 6
   - `values[7]` is 7
   - `values[8]` is 8
   - `values[9]` is 9
   - `values[10]` is 10
   - `values[11]` is 13
   - `values[12]` is 13
   - `sum_values[2]` is 1
   - `sum_values[3]` is 4
   - `sum_values[5]` is 9
   - `sum_values[6]` is 15
   - `sum_values[7]` is 24
   - `sum_values[8]` is 35
   - `sum_values[9]` is 45
   - `sum_values[10]` is 55
   - `sum_values[11]` is 11
   - `word` is '12'
   - `last` is 2
   - `remainder` is 2
   - `sum_total` is 13
   - `sum_values[12]` is 13

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 12, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 13.
   - `n` must remain at least 10 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 10, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 13, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `values[5]` is 5, `values[6]` is 6, `values[7]` is 7, `values[8]` is 8, `values[9]` is 9, `values[10]` is 10, `values[11]` is 13, `values[12]` is 13, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3]` is 4, `sum_values[5]` is 9, `sum_values[6]` is 15, `sum_values[7]` is 24, `sum_values[8]` is 35, `sum_values[9]` is 45, `sum_values[10]` is 55, `sum_values[11]` is 11, `word` is '12', `last` is 2, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 13, `sum_values[12]` is 13**
