Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 1, `values[0]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `values[i] = i` updates the list `values` by setting the element at index `i` to the value of `i`. Given that `i` was initially 0, the first element of the list `values` (i.e., `values[0]`) is now set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
