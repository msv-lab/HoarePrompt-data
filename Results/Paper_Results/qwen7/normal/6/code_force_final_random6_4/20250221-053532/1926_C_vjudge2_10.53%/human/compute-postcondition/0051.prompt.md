Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a series of input integers, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 11, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `values[5]` is 5, `values[6]` is 6, `values[7]` is 7, `values[8]` is 8, `values[9]` is 9, `values[10]` is 10, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3]` is 4, `sum_values[5]` is 9, `sum_values[6]` is 15, `sum_values[7]` is 24, `sum_values[8]` is 35, `sum_values[9]` is 45, `sum_values[10]` is 55.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all 10 iterations (from `i=0` to `i=10`), the variable `total` will be the sum of numbers from 0 to 10, which is 45. The `values` list will contain the numbers from 0 to 10 as they are assigned in each iteration of the loop. The `sum_values` list will store the cumulative sums up to each index, starting from 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10, n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 10, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is one of the input integers `n`, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 11, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `values[5]` is 5, `values[6]` is 6, `values[7]` is 7, `values[8]` is 8, `values[9]` is 9, `values[10]` is 10, `values[11]` is 11, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3] is 4, `sum_values[5]` is 9, `sum_values[6] is 15, `sum_values[7] is 24, `sum_values[8] is 35, `sum_values[9] is 45, `sum_values[10] is 55, `sum_values[11] is 11, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 11, `sum_total` is 11.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 10, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 12, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3] is 3, `values[4] is 4, `values[5] is 5, `values[6] is 6, `values[7] is 7, `values[8] is 8, `values[9] is 9, `values[10] is 10, `values[11] is 13, `values[12] is 13, `sum_values[2] is 1, `sum_values[3] is 4, `sum_values[5] is 9, `sum_values[6] is 15, `sum_values[7] is 24, `sum_values[8] is 35, `sum_values[9] is 45, `sum_values[10] is 55, `sum_values[11] is 11, `word` is '12', `last` is 2, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 13, `sum_values[12] is 13

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 10, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` plus one, with all elements initialized to 0, `i` is 13, `values[0]` is 0, `values[3]` is 3, `values[4]` is 4, `values[5]` is 5, `values[6]` is 6, `values[7] is 7, `values[8]` is 8, `values[9]` is 9, `values[10]` is 10, `values[11]` is 13, `values[12]` is 13, `values[13]` is 16, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[3] is 4, `sum_values[5] is 9, `sum_values[6]` is 15, `sum_values[7]` is 24, `sum_values[8]` is 35, `sum_values[9]` is 45, `sum_values[10]` is 55, `sum_values[11]` is 11, `word` is '13', `last` is 3, `remainder` is 3, `sum_total` is 20, `sum_values[13]` is 20




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
