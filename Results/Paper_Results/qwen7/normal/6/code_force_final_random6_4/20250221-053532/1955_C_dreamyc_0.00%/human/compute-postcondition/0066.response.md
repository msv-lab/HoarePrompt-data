Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns either ans + 1, where ans is the total count of times the condition a <= 0 or b <= 0 was met during the iterations, and 1 is added to it, or ans, which is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero.**
