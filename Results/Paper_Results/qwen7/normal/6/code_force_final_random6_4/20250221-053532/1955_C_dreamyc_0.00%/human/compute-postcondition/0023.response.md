Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements) with `b` appended to the right end, `b` is greater than 0, if `a > 0`, then `nums` is updated to append the value of `a` to the left end of the deque, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * b`, and both `a` and `b` are updated to `a - b` and `b - b` respectively, otherwise `ans` is set to 1, and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, `b`, or `nums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b` to the right end of the deque `nums`. Since `b` is greater than 0, the conditions for updating `a`, `b`, and `k` do not apply here. Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged, and the other variables retain their previous states except for `nums`, which now includes `b` at its right end.
