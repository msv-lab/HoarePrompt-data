Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque with one more element (the original two fewer elements plus the newly appended `a`), `a` is the first element that was originally popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the element `a` to the left end of the deque `nums`. This increases the number of elements in `nums` by one, making it a deque with one more element than before. The values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged.
