### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into a list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and `nums` as parameters.
   - It converts `nums` into a deque for efficient popping from both ends.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 ships left (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the deque, denoted as `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and checks if `k` is sufficient to reduce both durabilities by this minimum value.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to twice the minimum durability, it reduces `a` and `b` by this value, decrements `k` by twice the minimum durability, and appends the non-zero values back to the deque.
   - If `k` is insufficient, the loop breaks.
   - After each reduction, it increments `ans` by 1 for each ship that has sunk (i.e., its durability is reduced to 0).

4. **Final Check**:
   - After exiting the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still sufficient to sink it, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `ans`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Edge Cases and Correctness

1. **All Ships Sink Before All Attacks**:
   - If all ships sink before the specified number of attacks, the loop will terminate early, and `ans` will correctly count the number of sunk ships.

2. **Final Check for Last Ship**:
   - The final check ensures that if the last remaining ship can still be sunk by the remaining attacks, it is counted.

3. **Durability Reduction**:
   - The program correctly reduces the durability of the first and last ships in each iteration.
   - It ensures that once a ship sinks, it is no longer considered in future attacks.

4. **Handling Zero Durability**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a ship's durability reaches zero, and it is no longer subject to further attacks.

5. **Multiple Iterations**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple iterations of the loop, ensuring that the durability of ships is reduced appropriately and `ans` is incremented correctly.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program accurately simulates the attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.
