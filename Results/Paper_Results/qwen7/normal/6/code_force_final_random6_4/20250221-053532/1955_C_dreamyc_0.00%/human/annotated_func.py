#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x

            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)

    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least two elements in `nums`. After all iterations, `ans` will be the total count of times the condition `a <= 0` or `b <= 0` was met, which increments `ans` by 1. `k` will be reduced by the sum of all the `2 * x` values where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` in each iteration. `nums` will eventually become a deque with either 0 or 1 element left, depending on whether the last two elements were reduced to zero or not. If the last two elements were reduced to zero, `ans` will be incremented by 2 for each such pair, and `nums` will be empty. If one of the last two elements was reduced to zero but the other was not, `ans` will be incremented by 1, and `nums` will contain the non-zero element. If neither of the last two elements was reduced to zero, `ans` will not be incremented, and `nums` will contain the two non-zero elements.
    #
    #In summary, the final state will have `ans` being the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` being the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` being either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the total count of times the condition a <= 0 or b <= 0 was met during the iterations, and 1 is added to it.
    #State: `ans` is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` is the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` is either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements. Additionally, `k` is zero or `len(nums)` is greater than 1 or `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums)` is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the list `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest pair of elements, reducing them by their minimum value, and decrementing `k` accordingly. This process continues until `k` becomes zero or there are fewer than two elements left in `nums`. The function counts the number of times any element in the current pair is reduced to zero and returns this count plus one if the last remaining element (if any) can still be reduced by `k`, otherwise it simply returns the count.
