Postcondition: **`ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` is non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a > 0` and `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 \times x\), `k` is reduced by \(2 \times x\), `a` is adjusted by subtracting the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is decreased by the minimum of `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `ans` remains as either 1 or 2 depending on the initial value, and no changes are made to `k`, `a`, or `b`.**
