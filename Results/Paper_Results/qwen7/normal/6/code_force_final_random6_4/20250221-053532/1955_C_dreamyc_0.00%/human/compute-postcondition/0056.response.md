Postcondition: `a` and `b` are elements from `nums`, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than 0, then either `a` and `b` are reduced by `3 * x` and `k` is reduced by `2 * x` if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, or `a` and `b` remain unchanged and `x` remains as the minimum of the new `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged with `x` remaining as the minimum of the new `a` and `b`.
