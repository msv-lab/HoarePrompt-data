Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-1 integers (excluding the first and last elements), `a` is the first element of the original `nums` deque, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` deque.**

Explanation: The code removes the first element (`a`) from the deque `nums` using `popleft()` and removes the last element (`b`) from the deque `nums` using `pop()`. The variables `ans`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The deque `nums` now contains `n-1` elements.
