Output State: **`a` is `a - x`, `b` is `b - x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`**.

Explanation: Initially, `a` is set to `a - x`, `b` is the last element removed from `nums` using `pop()`, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. After executing `b -= x`, the value of `b` is updated by subtracting `x` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` remains `a - x`, `b` becomes `b - x`, and `x` remains the minimum of the updated `a` and the original `b`.
