Output State: **`ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element that was popped from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was popped from `nums`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
