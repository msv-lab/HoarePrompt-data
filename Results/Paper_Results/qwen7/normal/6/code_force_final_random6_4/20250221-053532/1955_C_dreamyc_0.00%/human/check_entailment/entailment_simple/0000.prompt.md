Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

# Annotated Program:
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:

        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is non-zero and there are at least two elements in `nums`. After all iterations, `ans` will be the total count of times the condition `a <= 0` or `b <= 0` was met, which increments `ans` by 1. `k` will be reduced by the sum of all the `2 * x` values where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` in each iteration. `nums` will eventually become a deque with either 0 or 1 element left, depending on whether the last two elements were reduced to zero or not. If the last two elements were reduced to zero, `ans` will be incremented by 2 for each such pair, and `nums` will be empty. If one of the last two elements was reduced to zero but the other was not, `ans` will be incremented by 1, and `nums` will contain the non-zero element. If neither of the last two elements was reduced to zero, `ans` will not be incremented, and `nums` will contain the two non-zero elements.
    #
    #In summary, the final state will have `ans` being the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` being the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` being either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the total count of times the condition a <= 0 or b <= 0 was met during the iterations, and 1 is added to it.
    #State: `ans` is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero, `k` is the remaining value after all reductions, and `nums` is either empty or containing up to two non-zero elements. Additionally, `k` is zero or `len(nums)` is greater than 1 or `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums)` is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the total count of times elements were reduced to zero.
