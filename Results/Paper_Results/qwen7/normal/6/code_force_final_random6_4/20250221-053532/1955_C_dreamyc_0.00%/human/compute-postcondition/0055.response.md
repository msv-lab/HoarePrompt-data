Postcondition: `a` and `b` are elements from `nums`, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than 0 and the conditions specified in the if part are met (i.e., `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`), then both `a` and `b` are reduced by `3 * x`, and `k` is reduced by `2 * x`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains as the minimum of the new `a` and `b`. Additionally, `ans` is increased by 1 if the else part is executed.
