Output State: **`a` is the first element removed from `nums` using `popleft()`, `b` is the last element removed from `nums` using `pop()`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a` and `b` to `x`. Since `a` is the first element removed from `nums` using `popleft()` and `b` is the last element removed from `nums` using `pop()`, `x` will hold the smaller of these two values. The states of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `a` and `b` were derived from `nums` using `popleft()` and `pop()` respectively, is preserved.
