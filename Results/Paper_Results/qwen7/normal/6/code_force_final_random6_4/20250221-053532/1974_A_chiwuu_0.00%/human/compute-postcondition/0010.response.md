Output State: **`t` is now `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`. Given that `t` was initially `b * 2`, the new value of `t` becomes `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. The conditions for `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition `t % 5 != 0` also remains valid since the operation performed does not affect the modulo 5 property of `t`.
