Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2 // 5`, `t` is decreased by 5.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`, which means `t` is now `b * 2 // 5 // 5`. Since `b * 2 // 5` is an integer division, `t` is effectively reduced by a factor of 5. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
