Output State: **`t1` is `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation:
- `t1` was originally defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Since `t` is now defined as `b * 2`, we can substitute `t` with `b * 2` in the expression for `t1`, resulting in `t1` being `b * 2 * 15 - b * 4` which simplifies to `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`, where `t1` is updated as described above.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The initial state of `t1` is now expressed in terms of `a` and `b` rather than `t` and `b`.
