Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is a string**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. Since `a` was originally a string, now `a` becomes an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
