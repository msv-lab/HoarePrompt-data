State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to the starting value of the range function, which is 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
