Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the input string `b` into an integer. The values of `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and the condition for `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t1` is still defined based on the same conditions, and `b` is now an integer.
