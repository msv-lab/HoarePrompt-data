Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `b * 2` to `t`. This changes the value of `t` but does not affect the values of `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for `t` which is now updated to `b * 2`.
