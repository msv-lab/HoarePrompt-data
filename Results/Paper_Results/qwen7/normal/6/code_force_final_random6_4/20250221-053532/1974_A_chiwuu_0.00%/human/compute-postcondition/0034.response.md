Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`**.

Explanation: The code sets `t` to `b * 2`. The values of `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
