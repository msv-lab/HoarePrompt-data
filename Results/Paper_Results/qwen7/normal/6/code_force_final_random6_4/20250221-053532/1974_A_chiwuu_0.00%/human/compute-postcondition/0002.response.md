Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is a string, `b` is a string**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is still greater than 0, and `i` is still 0. `a` and `b` are now strings containing the split parts of the input.
