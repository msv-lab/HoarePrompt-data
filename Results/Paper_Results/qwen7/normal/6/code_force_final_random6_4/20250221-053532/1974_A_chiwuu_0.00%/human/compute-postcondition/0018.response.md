Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. The value of `t1` remains unchanged and is still either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `t1` is still less than `a`.
