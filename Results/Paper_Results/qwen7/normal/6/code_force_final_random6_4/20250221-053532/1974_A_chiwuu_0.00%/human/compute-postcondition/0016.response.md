Output State: **`t1` is either `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5` or `t * 15 - b * 4` when `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and the current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. Therefore, the conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t1` is still dependent on the conditions given in the initial state.
