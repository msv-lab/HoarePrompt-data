Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is an integer
   - `b` is an integer
   - `t` is `b * 2`
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is increased by `t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or by `t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same because it is not modified within the loop body and is a condition for the loop continuation.

4. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t1` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `t` remain the same unless they are modified within the loop body, but no such modifications are mentioned.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`**
