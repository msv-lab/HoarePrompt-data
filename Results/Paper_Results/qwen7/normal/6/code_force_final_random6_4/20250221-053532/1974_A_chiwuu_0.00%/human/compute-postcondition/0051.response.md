Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()`**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged, so their states are the same as the initial state.
