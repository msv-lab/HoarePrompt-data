Postcondition: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t1` is updated to `a - (b * 2) * 15 - b * 4`, and if `a - t1` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `a - t1` divided by 15; otherwise, `t` is incremented by `a - t1` divided by 15 plus 1.
