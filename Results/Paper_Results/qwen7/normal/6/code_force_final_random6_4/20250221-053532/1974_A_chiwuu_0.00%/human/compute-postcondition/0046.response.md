Postcondition: `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is `b * 2`. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and if `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
