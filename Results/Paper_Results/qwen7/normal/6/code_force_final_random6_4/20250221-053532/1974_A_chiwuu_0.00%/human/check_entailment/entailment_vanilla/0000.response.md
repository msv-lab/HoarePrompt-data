Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates `t` as `b * 2`. This means that each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, so `t` represents the total number of cells taken by all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t` is divisible by 5, it divides `t` by 5. Otherwise, it performs integer division and adds 1 to account for any remainder.

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - It calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there are enough cells to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.

4. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it calculates how many more screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - It calculates `t2` as `a - t1`, representing the number of additional cells needed.
   - If `t2` is divisible by 15, it adds `t2 // 15` to `t`. Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the total number of screens needed.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct results.

#### Example 1: `1 1`
- `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
- `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
- `t1 >= 1`, so `t = 1`

#### Example 2: `7 2`
- `t = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
- `t1 >= 7`, so `t = 1`

#### Example 3: `12 4`
- `t = 4 * 2 = 8`
- `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
- `t1 >= 12`, so `t = 2`

#### Example 4: `0 3`
- `t = 3 * 2 = 6`
- `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 2`
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
- `t1 >= 0`, so `t = 2`

#### Example 5: `1 0`
- `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
- `t % 5 = 0`, so `t = 0`
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
- `t1 >= 1`, so `t = 1`

#### Example 6: `8 1`
- `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
- `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
- `t1 >= 8`, so `t = 1`

#### Example 7: `0 0`
- `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
- `t % 5 = 0`, so `t = 0`
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
- `t = 0`

#### Example 8: `2 0`
- `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
- `t % 5 = 0`, so `t = 0`
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
- `t1 >= 2`, so `t = 1`

#### Example 9: `15 0`
- `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
- `t % 5 = 0`, so `t = 0`
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
- `t1 >= 15`, so `t = 1`

#### Example 10: `8 2`
- `t = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 1`
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
- `t1 >= 8`, so `t = 1`

#### Example 11: `0 9`
- `t = 9 * 2 = 18`
- `t % 5 != 0`, so `t = 4`
- `t1 = 4 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 48`
- `t1 >= 0`, so `t = 4`
