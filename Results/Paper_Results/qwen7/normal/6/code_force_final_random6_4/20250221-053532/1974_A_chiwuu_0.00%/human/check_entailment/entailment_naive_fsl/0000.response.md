Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate this:

- For the input `12 4`, the expected output is `2`. This is because we can place 4 icons of size `2x2` in 1 screen, and the remaining 8 icons of size `1x1` can be placed in another screen. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Let's analyze the program's logic:
1. It calculates `t = b * 2` which represents the total number of `2x2` icons in terms of `1x1` cells.
2. It then checks if `t` is divisible by 5 and adjusts `t` accordingly.
3. It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` which seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons.
4. It then checks if `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of `1x1` icons) and sets `t` accordingly.
5. Finally, it calculates `t2` and adjusts `t` further.

This logic does not correctly handle the placement of `1x1` icons in the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons. A more accurate approach would involve calculating the number of full `2x2` icons that can fit in each screen and then determining how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining `1x1` icons.

For instance, in the case of `12 4`, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed, leading to an incorrect output.
