Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer converted from the first input split from `input().split()`, `b` is the second input split from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, and `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns `t1` the value of `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t` is already determined as `b * 2`, and if `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is set to `b * 2 // 5`; otherwise, `t` is set to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. However, since the calculation for `t1` does not depend on whether `t % 5 == 0` or not, the value of `t1` is directly computed using the current value of `t`.
