Output State: **`t` is now `b * 2 // 5`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to `t // 5`. Given that `t` was initially `b * 2` and is now `b * 2 // 5`, the other conditions remain unchanged: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer, and `b` is an integer.
