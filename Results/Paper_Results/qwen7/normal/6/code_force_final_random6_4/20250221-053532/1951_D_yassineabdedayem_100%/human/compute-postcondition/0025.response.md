Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer equal to the first number entered.
- `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
- `t` is decreased by 1 (though the value of `t` itself is not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Output: **YES**
