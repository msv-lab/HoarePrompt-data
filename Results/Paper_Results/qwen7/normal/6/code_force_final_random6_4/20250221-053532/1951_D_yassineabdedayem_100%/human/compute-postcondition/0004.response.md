Output: **YES**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `n` is set to the first number entered, and `k` is set to the second number entered. The current value of `n` is also equal to the current value of `k`. Therefore, when the `print('YES')` statement is executed, it will simply print the string 'YES'.
