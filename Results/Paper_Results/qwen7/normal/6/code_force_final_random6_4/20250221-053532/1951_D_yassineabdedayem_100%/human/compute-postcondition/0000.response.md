Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. The other conditions and constraints for `n` and `k` are not affected by this line of code, so they remain as part of the precondition.
