Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES", `1` (indicating 1 stall), and `1` (the price per jewel for the single stall). This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins if the price is `1`.
   - If `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program prints "YES", `2` (indicating 2 stalls), and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is also correct because:
     - With the first stall priced at `n - k + 1`, Alice can buy `1` jewel.
     - With the second stall priced at `1`, Alice can buy `k - 1` more jewels.
     - The total number of jewels bought is `1 + (k - 1) = k`, which matches the requirement.
   - Otherwise, the program prints "NO", indicating that it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program correctly formats the output for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Stall Limit**: The program ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60, which is within the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all cases correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
