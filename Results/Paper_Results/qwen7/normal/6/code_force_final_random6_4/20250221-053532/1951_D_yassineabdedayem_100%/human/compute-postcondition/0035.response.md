Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `t` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` reads two integers from standard input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but its initial value is not specified, only that it is decreased by 1. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k`, and the fact that `t` has been decreased by 1.
