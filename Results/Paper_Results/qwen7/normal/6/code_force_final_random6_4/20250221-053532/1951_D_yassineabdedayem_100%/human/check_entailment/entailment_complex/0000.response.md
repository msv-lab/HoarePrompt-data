Reasoning:

The annotated program provided is checking the conditions specified in the problem statement and providing the correct output based on those conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Condition Checking**: 
   - If \( n \) is equal to \( k \), it means Alice already has the exact number of jewels she needs, so Bob can just set one stall with a price of 1 coin. Hence, it prints 'YES', 1, and 1.
   - If \( n + 2 > 2k \), it means Alice can afford to buy more than \( k \) jewels if the price is set appropriately. By setting the first stall with a price of \( n - k + 1 \) coins and the second stall with a price of 1 coin, Alice will buy exactly \( k \) jewels. Hence, it prints 'YES', 2, and the appropriate prices.
   - In all other cases, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to achieve exactly \( k \) jewels under the given constraints.

2. **Stall Setup and Pricing**:
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.
   - The logic for setting the prices is sound and meets the requirements of the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like when \( n \) and \( k \) are very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)) and when \( n \) is exactly \( k \).

Given the logic and the conditions checked, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
