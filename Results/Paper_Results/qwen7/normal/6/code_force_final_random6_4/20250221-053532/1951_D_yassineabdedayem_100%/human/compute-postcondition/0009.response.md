Output: **YES**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `n` and `k` are integers where `n` is the first number entered and `k` is the second number entered. It is also given that `n` is not equal to `k` and `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'YES'. Since no values of `n` and `k` are specified, we cannot determine their exact values, but the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` is satisfied. Therefore, the output remains 'YES'.
