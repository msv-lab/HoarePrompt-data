### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand why the original assessment is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from a given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90Â° rotation.

#### Provided Solution:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` currently checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise.
- This logic is insufficient because:
  - A rectangle can still be transformed into another rectangle even if one of its dimensions is odd, as long as the other dimension allows for such transformations.
  - For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and then rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
  - Similarly, a \(2 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and then rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.

#### Corrected Logic:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and if the other dimension is even.
- This ensures that:
  - If one dimension is even and greater than 1, we can always cut the rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
  - For example, if \(a > 1\) and \(b\) is even, we can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1(a, b)` as checking if `b` is even.
- The original assessment suggests a corrected function:
  ```python
  def func_1(a, b):
      return 'yes' if a > 1 and b % 2 == 0 or b > 1 and a % 2 == 0 else 'no'
  ```
- This corrected function checks if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and if the other dimension is even, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate, and the provided solution needs to be corrected to match the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
