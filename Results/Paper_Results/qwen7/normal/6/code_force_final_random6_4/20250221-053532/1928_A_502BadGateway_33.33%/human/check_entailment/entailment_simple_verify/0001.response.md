### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can transform a given rectangle \(a \times b\) into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - If the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be recombined to form a new distinct rectangle, the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, it is "No".

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(a, b)` with the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the dimension `b` is even. If `b` is even, it returns 'yes', otherwise 'no'.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even.
   - It does not consider all possible ways to split the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and whether those smaller rectangles can form a new distinct rectangle.
   - The function does not handle cases where splitting along the `a` dimension could result in forming a new distinct rectangle.

4. **Examples from the Problem Statement**:
   - **Test Case 2 (2x1)**: The function correctly returns "No" because the only way to split a 2x1 rectangle is into two 1x1 rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.
   - **Test Case 3 (2x6)**: The function incorrectly returns "No" because splitting the 2x6 rectangle into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranging them can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is distinct from the original 2x6 rectangle.
   - **Test Case 5 (2x2)**: The function correctly returns "Yes" because splitting the 2x2 rectangle into two 1x2 rectangles and rearranging them can form a 1x4 rectangle, which is distinct from the original 2x2 rectangle.
   - **Test Case 7 (6x3)**: The function incorrectly returns "No" because splitting the 6x3 rectangle into two 3x3 rectangles and rearranging them can form a 3x6 rectangle, which is distinct from the original 6x3 rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The given function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient for determining if a new distinct rectangle can be formed. The function fails to consider all possible ways to split the rectangle and whether those splits can form a new distinct rectangle.

**Original Assessment**:
- The original assessment concluded that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and provided specific examples where the function returned incorrect results.

**Evaluation**:
- The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if a new distinct rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the function needs to be revised to properly check all possible ways to split the rectangle.

**Final Evaluation**:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
