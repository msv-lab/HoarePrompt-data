### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description**: Bob can cut a rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle must be different from the original one, considering rotations as identical.

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1(a, b)` currently checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. This logic is insufficient because:
   - It fails to account for the possibility of cutting along the `a` dimension when `a` is even.
   - It incorrectly returns 'no' for cases where rearranging the pieces can form a new rectangle.

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment correctly identified that the provided function is insufficient and proposed a corrected version of the function:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       return 'yes' if a > 1 and b % 2 == 0 or b > 1 and a % 2 == 0 else 'no'
   ```
   This corrected function checks if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and if the other dimension is even. This logic covers all valid cases as described in the problem statement.

4. **Verification**:
   - **Case 1**: \(2 \times 6\)
     - Cutting into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and forming a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle is valid.
     - The corrected function will return 'yes' because `b > 1` and `a % 2 == 0`.
   
   - **Case 2**: \(2 \times 4\)
     - Cutting into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and forming a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle is valid.
     - The corrected function will return 'yes' because `b > 1` and `a % 2 == 0`.
   
   - **Case 3**: \(1 \times 1\)
     - No valid cuts can form a different rectangle.
     - The corrected function will return 'no' because both dimensions are 1.
   
   - **Case 4**: \(2 \times 3\)
     - Cutting into two \(2 \times 1.5\) rectangles is not possible since we need integer dimensions.
     - The corrected function will return 'no' because neither `a` nor `b` is greater than 1 and even.

5. **Conclusion**: The original assessment was accurate. The provided function `func_1(a, b)` is indeed incorrect, and the suggested correction is necessary to handle all valid cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
