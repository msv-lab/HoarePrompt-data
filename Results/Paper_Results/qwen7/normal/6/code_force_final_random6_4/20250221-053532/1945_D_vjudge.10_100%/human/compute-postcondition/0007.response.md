Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pergunta` is a string with the new minimum value of `min(pergunta, x + a[i])`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, the lengths of `a` and `b` are both equal to `n`, `x` is `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])`, and `i < m` is true.**

Explanation: 
- The code increments `x` by the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, the current value of `i` remains `n-1`.
- Given that `i < m` is true (as per the initial state), `pergunta` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Here, `x` is set to `min(a[i-1], b[i-1])` because when `i` was `n-1`, `x` was updated to `min(a[n-2], b[n-2])`.
- All other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `pergunta`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
