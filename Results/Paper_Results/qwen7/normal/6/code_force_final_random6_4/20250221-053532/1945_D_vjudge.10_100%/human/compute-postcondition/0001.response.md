Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. In this case, the loop variable is `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `n-1` to `0`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = n-1` and decrements by 1 each time, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `x`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop itself. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

5. **Formulate the Final State**: Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `pergunta` is a string, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, the lengths of `a` and `b` are both equal to `n`, and `x` is 0**
