Output State: **`pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` updates the value of `pergunta` to be the minimum between its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. Since the initial values of `x` and `a[i]` are not specified, we cannot provide a more specific value for `pergunta`. However, we know that `pergunta` now holds the minimum value between its original value and `x + a[i]`.
