Output State: `i` is `-1`, `pergunta` is the minimum value between its initial value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]` for all `i` where `i < m`, `a` and `b` are lists of non-negative integers with lengths equal to `n`, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= `m` <= `n` <= 200000, `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1` because the loop decrements `i` starting from `n-1` until it reaches `-1`. The variable `pergunta` will hold the minimum value obtained from comparing its initial value with `x + a[i]` for each `i` where `i < m`. The variable `x` will be the cumulative sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b` from index `n-1` down to `0`. The lengths of lists `a` and `b` and the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
