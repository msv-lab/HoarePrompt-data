Output State: **`i` is `i_initial - 1`; `x` is increased by `min(a[i_initial - 1], b[i_initial - 1])`; if `i_initial - 1 < m`, then `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x_initial + a[i_initial - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `i` has been decremented by 1. The value of `x` has been increased by the minimum value between `a[i_initial - 1]` and `b[i_initial - 1]`. Additionally, if `i_initial - 1` is less than `m`, then `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum value between its current value and the sum of `x_initial` and `a[i_initial - 1]`. If `i_initial - 1` is not within the bounds of the array, `pergunta` retains its original value.
