Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The function `func_1` iterates backward through the queue (from the last person to the first). It calculates the cumulative cost (`x`) of moving Kirill to the current position and updates the minimum cost (`pergunta`) if moving to a position before `m` results in a lower cost.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The cost includes the cost of bribing the current person (`a[i]`) and the intermediate costs (`b[i]` for positions between the current and the target position).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
