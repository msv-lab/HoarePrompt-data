Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `pergunta` to infinity, which is used to keep track of the minimum cost.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates backward through the list `a` (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` with the minimum value between the current `pergunta` and the accumulated cost `x` plus `a[i]`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `pergunta`.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The backward iteration ensures that we consider the cost of moving Kirill from the end of the queue towards the front.
   - This approach is correct because it allows us to accumulate the minimum cost required to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation is done correctly by considering both `a[i]` (cost to swap with the person at position `i`) and `b[i]` (cost to swap with all subsequent people).
   - The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` ensures that we always take the cheaper option when moving Kirill to the left.

3. **Boundary Condition:**
   - The condition `if i < m:` ensures that we only update `pergunta` when Kirill is within the desired range `[0, m-1]`.
   - This is necessary because Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

4. **Initialization of `pergunta`:**
   - Initializing `pergunta` to infinity ensures that the first comparison will set `pergunta` to the initial cost of moving Kirill to the first position.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program iterates backward through the queue, calculates the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people, and outputs the result.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
