Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero).

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `t` is 1001
   - `i` is \(1004 + (n - 3)\)
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

3. **Loop Body Analysis**: The problem states that the loop body is omitted, but we know from the final state that `i` is calculated as \(1001 + n\). This implies that `i` starts at 1002 and increments by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, the loop runs `n` times, and after `n` iterations, `i` becomes \(1001 + n\).

4. **Determine the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain non-zero. Since `t` is currently 1001 (which is non-zero), the loop can execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t`. It should remain non-zero (1001) for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 1001, `i` is \(1004 + (n - 3)\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
