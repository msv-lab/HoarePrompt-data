Output State: `t` is 1000, `i` is 3003, `n` is 1000.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 1000 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration but starts at 1000 and reaches 0 after 1000 iterations. The variable `i` starts at 1002 and increments by 1 for each iteration, so after 1000 iterations, `i` will be `1002 + 1000 - 1 = 2001`. However, the provided pattern suggests that `i` is calculated as `1001 + n`, where `n` is the original value. Given that `n` is 1000, `i` will be `1001 + 1000 = 2001`, but the pattern seems to increment by 3 each time, leading to `i` being `1001 + 3 * 3 = 3003` after 3 iterations and then continuing this pattern for all 1000 iterations. Therefore, `i` is 3003 after all iterations. The value of `n` remains 1000 as it was initially set.
