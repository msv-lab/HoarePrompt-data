Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( t \) and \( n \), where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \). It then prints \( t \) lines, each containing \( n \) occurrences of the number 1 followed by the line number starting from 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the specified pattern.**
