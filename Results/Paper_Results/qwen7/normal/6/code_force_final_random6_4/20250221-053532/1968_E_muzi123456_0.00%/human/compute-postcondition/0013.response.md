Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, `i` is 1001, `n` is 1000.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, and since the loop condition is `range(1, n + 1)`, if the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is at most 1000, after the loop completes, `i` will be 1001. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
