You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 1000, `i` is 3003, `n` is 1000.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 1000 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration but starts at 1000 and reaches 0 after 1000 iterations. The variable `i` starts at 1002 and increments by 1 for each iteration, so after 1000 iterations, `i` will be `1002 + 1000 - 1 = 2001`. However, the provided pattern suggests that `i` is calculated as `1001 + n`, where `n` is the original value. Given that `n` is 1000, `i` will be `1001 + 1000 = 2001`, but the pattern seems to increment by 3 each time, leading to `i` being `1001 + 3 * 3 = 3003` after 3 iterations and then continuing this pattern for all 1000 iterations. Therefore, `i` is 3003 after all iterations. The value of `n` remains 1000 as it was initially set.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, the function determines and returns a result based on the values of t and n.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
