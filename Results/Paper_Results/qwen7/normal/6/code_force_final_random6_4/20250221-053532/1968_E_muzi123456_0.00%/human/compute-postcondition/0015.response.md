Output: **' '**

Explanation: 
- The initial state defines that `t` is an integer between 0 and 49.
- `i` is set to 1001.
- `n` is set to 1000.

The print statement simply outputs a space character (`' '`). Since there are no variables being printed within the `print` statement itself, only the space character is printed.
