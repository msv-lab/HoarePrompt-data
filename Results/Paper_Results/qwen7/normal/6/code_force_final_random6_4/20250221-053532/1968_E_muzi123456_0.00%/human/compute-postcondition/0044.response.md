Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, printing "1" followed by the current value of `i` for each iteration. After all iterations, `t` remains 1000, `i` is `1004 + n`, and `n` is the original input integer.**

Explanation: The loop prints "1" followed by the current value of `i` for each iteration from 1 to `n`. Since `i` starts at `1004 + (n - 3)` and increments by 1 with each iteration, after `n` iterations, `i` will be `1004 + (n - 3) + n = 1004 + 2n - 3 = 1001 + 2n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged at 1000 as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `n` retains its original value as it is used only as the loop counter.
