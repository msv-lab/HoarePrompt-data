Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all potential cases. For instance, consider \(n = 4\). The program outputs the following coordinates:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
```

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |3-1|, |1-1| + |4-1|, |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-2| + |2-1|, |1-2| + |3-1|, |1-2| + |4-1|, |1-3| + |1-1|, |1-3| + |2-1|, |1-3| + |3-1|, |1-3| + |4-1|, |1-4| + |1-1|, |1-4| + |2-1|, |1-4| + |3-1|, |1-4| + |4-1| \}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
\]

The distinct values in \(\mathcal{H}\) are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which means the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 7. However, the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 9, as demonstrated by the following arrangement:

```
1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4
```

The set of Manhattan distances for these points is:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |3-1|, |4-1| + |3-1|, |4-1| + |4-1|, |1-1| + |3-3|, |1-3| + |3-1|, |1-3| + |3-3|, |4-1| + |3-3|, |4-3| + |3-1| \}
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{0, 2, 3, 5, 0, 2, 4, 5, 4\}
\]

The distinct values in \(\mathcal{H}\) are \(\{0, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which means the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 9. Therefore, the program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\), and hence it is incorrect.
