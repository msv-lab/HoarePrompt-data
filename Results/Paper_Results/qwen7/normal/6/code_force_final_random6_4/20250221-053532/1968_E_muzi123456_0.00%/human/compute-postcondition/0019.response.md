Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these objects**: From the given state, we know:
   - `t` is 1001 (this variable is not involved in the loop).
   - `i` is 1002 (this value will be overwritten by the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer (its exact value is unknown but must be considered).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `i` will be set to 1 by the loop itself, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The final state should be:
**`t` is 1001, `i` is 1002, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**

So, the answer is:
State: **`t` is 1001, `i` is 1002, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
