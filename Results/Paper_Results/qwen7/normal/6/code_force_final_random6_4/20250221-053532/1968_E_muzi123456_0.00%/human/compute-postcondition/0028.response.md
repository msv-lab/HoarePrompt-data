Output State: `t` is 1001, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1003.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration starting from 1002. The variable `t` remains unchanged at 1001 as it is not affected by the loop. The condition on `n` must be that it is greater than 1003 to ensure the loop runs at least 3 times, and since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1003 to complete all iterations.
