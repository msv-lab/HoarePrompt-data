Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`).
   - `n` is some value (let's call it `n_value`).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_end`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_end + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n + 1` must still hold true, so `i_end + 1 < n_value` must be true.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `i_end + 1`.
   - `n` remains `n_value`.

Given the general form, if we don't know the exact values of `i_end` and `n_value`, we can express the final state in terms of these variables.

**State:**
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `n` must be `n_value`.

Since we don't have specific values for `i_end` and `n_value`, we can generalize the answer as follows:

**State:**
- `i` is `i_end + 1`.
- `n` must be `n_value`.

If we had specific values, we would substitute them accordingly. For example, if `i_end` was 3 and `n_value` was 5, the state would be:

**State:**
- `i` is 4.
- `n` must be 5.
