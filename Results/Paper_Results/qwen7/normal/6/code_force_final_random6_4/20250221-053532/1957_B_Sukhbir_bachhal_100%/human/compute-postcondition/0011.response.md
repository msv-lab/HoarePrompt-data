Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is 2, `n` is greater than 0 after being right-shifted by 1, `n` is now `n` right-shifted by 1.**

The code `n >>= 1` performs a right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. This means that the value of `n` is divided by 2 and truncated to an integer. The other variables (`t` and `position`) remain unchanged. Since `n` must be greater than 0 after the right shift, the new value of `n` will be its original value divided by 2, ensuring it remains positive if it was originally greater than 0.
