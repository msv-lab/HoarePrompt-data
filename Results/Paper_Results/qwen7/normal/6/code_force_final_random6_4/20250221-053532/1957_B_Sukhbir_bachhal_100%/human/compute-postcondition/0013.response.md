Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is the number of times `n` can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` until it becomes 0. The variable `position` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed, which is equivalent to the number of times `n` can be right-shifted before it reaches 0. Therefore, once `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and `position` will be set to the total number of right-shifts performed.
