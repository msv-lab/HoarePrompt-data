Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is 3, `n` is greater than 0 after being right-shifted by 1.**

Explanation: The code `position += 1` increments the value of `position` by 1. Initially, `position` was 2, so after executing the code, `position` becomes 3. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
