The only variable in the loop head is the variable `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `n != 0`. Right before the loop, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), but it is not guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be non-zero for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, with `n` not equal to 0, and `position` is 0, and `n` must be non-zero**
