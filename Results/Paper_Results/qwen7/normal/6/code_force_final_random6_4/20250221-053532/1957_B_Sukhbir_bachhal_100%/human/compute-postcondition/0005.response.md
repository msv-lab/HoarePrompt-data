Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is 0, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1.**

The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. This means that the binary representation of `n` is shifted one position to the right, discarding the rightmost bit and filling the leftmost bit with the sign bit (for signed integers) or zero (for unsigned integers). The value of `t` and `position` remain unchanged.
