Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and processes them.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - If `n > 1`, it calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest power of 2 less than `k` (let's call this `2^counter - 1`).
   - It appends `2^counter - 1` to the array `arr`.
   - It then appends `k - (2^counter - 1)` to `arr`.
   - For the remaining positions in `arr`, it appends `0`s.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the position of the highest bit set in `n` and returns `position - 1`.
   - If `n` is `0`, it returns `-1`.

### Evaluation Using the Function Summary

- The function `func_1` correctly identifies the highest bit position in the binary representation of `n` and returns the appropriate value.
- Given the function summary, `func_1(k)` will return the highest bit position minus one for any positive `k`.

### Testing Specific Cases

1. **Case: \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 5 \):**
   - The program should output `5`.
   - This is correct because the only element in the array must be `5` to satisfy the sum condition.

2. **Case: \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):**
   - The program should output `[1, 2]`.
   - The bitwise OR of `[1, 2]` is `3` (binary `11`), which is correct.

3. **Case: \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 5 \):**
   - The program should output `[5, 0]`.
   - The bitwise OR of `[5, 0]` is `5` (binary `101`), which is correct.

4. **Case: \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):**
   - The program should output `[1, 1, 1]`.
   - The bitwise OR of `[1, 1, 1]` is `111` (binary `7`), which is correct.

5. **Case: \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 51 \):**
   - The program should output `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]`.
   - The bitwise OR of `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]` is `101111` (binary `47`), which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the problem by ensuring the sum of the elements equals `k` and the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized. The function `func_1` is used appropriately to find the highest bit position, and the rest of the elements are set to zero to meet the sum requirement.

Final: **True**
