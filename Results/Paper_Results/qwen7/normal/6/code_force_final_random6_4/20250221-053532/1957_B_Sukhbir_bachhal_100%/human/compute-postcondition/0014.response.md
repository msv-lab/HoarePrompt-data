Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is the number of times `n` can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit until `n` becomes 0. The variable `position` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed, which is equivalent to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. Therefore, once `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and `position` will be the total number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`.
