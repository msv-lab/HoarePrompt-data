### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns `-1` if `n` is `0`.
   - If `n` is not `0`, it calculates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form and returns this value minus one (`position - 1`).

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest power of 2 less than `k` (stored in `2 ** counter - 1`).
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr` and subtracts this value from `k` to get the remaining sum.
   - The remaining elements of `arr` are set to `0` to ensure the total sum is `k`.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Binary OR Operation Consideration:**
   - The goal is to maximize the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the array.
   - Using `2 ** counter - 1` ensures that the binary representation of this number is filled with `1`s up to the `counter`-th bit.
   - This approach helps in maximizing the number of `1`s in the OR result because `2 ** counter - 1` has the highest possible number of `1`s for a given bit length.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case when `n == 1` correctly by just printing `k`.
   - The logic for `n > 1` ensures that the sum is maintained and the OR operation is optimized.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output for each test case satisfies both conditions: the sum of the elements equals `k`, and the OR operation results in a binary representation with the maximum number of `1`s.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of integers that meet the specified conditions.
