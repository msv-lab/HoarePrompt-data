Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, often representing the index or a value generated by `range`.
   - `int(input())`: This is the condition that determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value determines the number of iterations.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a positive integer (greater than 0).

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, the state before the loop must include the condition that the input value is a positive integer.
   - The `ans_list` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains as is.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, input value must be a positive integer**
