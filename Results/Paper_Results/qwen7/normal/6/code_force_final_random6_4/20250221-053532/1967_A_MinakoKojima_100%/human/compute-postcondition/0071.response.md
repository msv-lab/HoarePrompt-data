Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by `k // (i + 1)`, `i` is 3, `k` is 0, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, and if `i` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by `k // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 3, `ans` is incremented by `0 // (3 + 1)`, which is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged, and `res` is decremented by 1 if `dif` equals 0.
