Postcondition: `i` is 4, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `k` is either `-dif * 5` or 0, `res` is either -2 or 0, `ans` is either `ans + (a[5] - a[4])` or 0, and `n` must be greater than 4. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is set to -2 and `ans` is incremented by `a[5] - a[4]`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0 and `ans` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
