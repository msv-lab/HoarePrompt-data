Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` retains its original value and is not 0, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` multiplied by 2; `ans` is increased by `dif`, and `k` is decreased by `dif * 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, which is `dif * 3`. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif`, and the value of `dif` remains unchanged.
