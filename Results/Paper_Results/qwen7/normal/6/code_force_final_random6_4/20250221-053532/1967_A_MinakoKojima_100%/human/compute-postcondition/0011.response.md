Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is -1**

The value of `res` is decremented by 1. Initially, `res` is not explicitly defined, but since it is used in the operation, we infer it was previously 0 (as no other value is given). After the operation, `res` becomes -1. The values of `i` and `dif` remain unchanged.
