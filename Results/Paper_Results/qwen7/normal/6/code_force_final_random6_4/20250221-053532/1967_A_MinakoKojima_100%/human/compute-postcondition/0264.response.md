Output State: **`i` is 7 + (n - 1), `k` is not 0, `res` is 8, `ans` is ans + 8, `ans_list` contains the initial value of `a[0]` until the last updated value of `ans` is added.**

Explanation: The code `ans += res` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `res`. Given that `res` is 8, `ans` is updated to `ans + 8`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans_list`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
