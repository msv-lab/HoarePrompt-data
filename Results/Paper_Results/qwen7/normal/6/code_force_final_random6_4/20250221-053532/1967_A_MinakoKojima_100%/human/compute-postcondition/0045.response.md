Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is `-dif * 3`, `res` is decreased by 2.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` remains either 2 or 3.
- The value of `ans` remains increased by `dif`.
- Since `k` was initially 0 if `i` is 2, and the code updates `k` to `k -= dif * (i + 1)`, if `i` is 2, `k` becomes `-dif * 3`. If `i` is 3, `k` becomes `-2 * dif`.
- The value of `res` is decreased by 2, which is already mentioned in the initial state.
