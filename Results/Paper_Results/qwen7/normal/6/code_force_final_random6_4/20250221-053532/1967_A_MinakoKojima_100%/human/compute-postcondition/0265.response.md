Output State: **`i` is 7 + (n - 1), `k` is not 0, `res` is 8, `ans` is ans + 8, `ans_list` contains the initial value of `a[0]` and the value of `ans` which is ans + 8.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `ans` to `ans_list`. Since `ans` was previously `ans + 8`, the new value of `ans` is stored in `ans_list`. All other variables remain unchanged.
