Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` is increased by `dif` if `i` is 3, `k` is 0 if `i` is 2, `res` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 3, `res` is `res - 1`**

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. The value of `res` was previously decreased by 1 if `i` is 3, so now it is decreased by 1 again. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, `ans`, and `k`) remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
