Output State: **`i` is 7 + (n - 1), `k` is not 0, `res` is 8, `ans` is ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1), and `ans_list` contains the initial value of `a[0]` until the last updated value of `ans` is added.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` to it. Since the initial value of `ans` is the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` up to the (n-1)th element plus `k // n`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
