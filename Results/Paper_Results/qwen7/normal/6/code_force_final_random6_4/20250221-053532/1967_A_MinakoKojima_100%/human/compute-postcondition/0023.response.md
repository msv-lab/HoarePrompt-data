Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` retains its original value, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `k // (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `k // 2`. The values of `dif` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
