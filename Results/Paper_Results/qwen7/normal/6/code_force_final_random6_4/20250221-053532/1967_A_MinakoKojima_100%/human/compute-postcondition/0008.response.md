Output State: **`i` is 1; `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

Explanation: The code `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]` updates the variable `dif` to be the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` is 1. Therefore, `dif` is calculated as `a[1] - a[0]`. The values of `total` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
