Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `k` is `-dif * 3`, `res` is decreased by 3.**

Explanation: The code `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially decreased by 2, after this line, `res` is further decreased by 1, making it decreased by a total of 3. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged.
