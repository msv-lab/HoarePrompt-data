Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled by the loop `for _ in range(int(input()))`.

2. **Permutation Generation**: Inside the loop, the function `func_1()` is called. This function generates a permutation of length `n` using the following steps:
   - It creates a list `a` containing integers from `1` to `n`.
   - It reverses every second element in the list `a`. This means the elements at even indices remain the same, while the elements at odd indices are reversed.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - The generated permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n]` with every second element reversed (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n]` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n]`) ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (where `1 ≤ i, j < n` and `i ≠ j`) satisfy the condition that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - For example, consider the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Here, `p_1=1` does not divide `p_3=3`, and `p_2=2` does not divide `p_4=4`. Similarly, `p_1=1` does not divide `p_4=4`, and `p_2=2` does not divide `p_3=3`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the generated permutation for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
