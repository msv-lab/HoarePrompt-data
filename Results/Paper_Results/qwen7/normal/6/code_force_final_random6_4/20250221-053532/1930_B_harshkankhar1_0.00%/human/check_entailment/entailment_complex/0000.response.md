Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a permutation of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - It generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then reverses the order of every second element in the list (`a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`).

3. **Generated Permutation**:
   - The generated list will have the form: `[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n]` with every second element reversed.
   - For example, if \( n = 4 \), the list becomes `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - If \( n = 5 \), the list becomes `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify if the generated permutations satisfy the condition:
     - For \( n = 4 \):
       - Possible pairs to check: (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 3), (4, 3).
       - No pair satisfies the condition because none of the elements divide each other in the required manner.
     - For \( n = 5 \):
       - Possible pairs to check: (1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5).
       - Again, no pair satisfies the condition.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The generated permutations do not contain any pair \( (i, j) \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Therefore, the function correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
