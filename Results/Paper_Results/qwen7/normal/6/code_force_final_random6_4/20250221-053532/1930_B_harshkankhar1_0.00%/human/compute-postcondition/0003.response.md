Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function determines whether the conditions for t and n are met and processes them accordingly, returning outputs based on these conditions.**

Note: The actual processing and return values within the function body are not described here, only the input constraints and expected behavior are outlined.
