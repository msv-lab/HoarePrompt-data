Functionality: **The function processes a series of integer inputs. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of subsequent integer inputs. For each of these `t` inputs, it calculates and prints the value of the input integer decreased by one. After processing all inputs, the function does not return any value but ensures that for each input `x`, the value `x - 1` is printed.**
