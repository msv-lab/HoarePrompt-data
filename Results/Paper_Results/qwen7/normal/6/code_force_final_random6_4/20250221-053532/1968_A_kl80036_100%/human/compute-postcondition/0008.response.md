Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is `x - 1`.
   - `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
   - `new_input_value` must be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 1`.
   - `x` is updated to the new input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. This means the loop will run based on the new input integer provided after the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - The number of iterations for the loop is determined by the new input integer.
   - The variable `x` is updated to the new input integer, so it will be used as the new limit for the loop.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `previous_i + 1` (since `i` is incremented by 1).
- The new input integer will be used to determine the number of iterations, so `int(new_input_value)` will be the new limit for the loop.
- `x` is updated to `new_input_value`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is the new input integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, `new_input_value` must be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 2`**.
