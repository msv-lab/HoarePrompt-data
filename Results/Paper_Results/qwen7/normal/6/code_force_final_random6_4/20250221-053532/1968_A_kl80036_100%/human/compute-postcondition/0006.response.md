Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `new_input_value` must be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 1`, `x` is updated to the new input integer.**

This output state reflects that the value of `x` has been updated to a new input integer, while the other variables retain their previous relationships and constraints. Specifically, `y` remains as `x - 1`, `i` is still `previous_i + 1`, and `new_input_value` must still be greater than or equal to `previous_i + 1`.
