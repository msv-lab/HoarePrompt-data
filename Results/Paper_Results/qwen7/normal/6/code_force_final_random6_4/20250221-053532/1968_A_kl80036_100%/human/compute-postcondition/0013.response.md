Output State: The loop has executed for all input cases, meaning `i` is now equal to the total number of inputs provided. For each iteration, `x` was an input integer, and `y` was calculated as `x - 1`. After all iterations, `i` will be the sum of all inputs minus the number of inputs (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 for each input). `x` will hold the value of the last input provided, and `y` will be the last input value minus one.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `i` will be the total number of inputs, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
