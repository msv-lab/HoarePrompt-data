Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). Instead, it simply prints \(x - 1\) for each test case, which does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

For example, consider the input \(x = 10\):
- The program outputs \(y = 9\).
- However, \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
- A better choice would be \(y = 5\), since \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

Thus, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), making it incorrect.
