Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

The code assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `m`, and `count` remain unchanged, and `ans` now holds the value of `n`.
