Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` is specified to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` after executing this line of code will be an integer within this range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
