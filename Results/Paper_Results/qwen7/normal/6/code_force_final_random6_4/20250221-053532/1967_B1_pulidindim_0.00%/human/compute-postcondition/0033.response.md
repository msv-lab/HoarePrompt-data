Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1 + (n / 5 - 1) / 6 + 3 + (n / 7 - 0) / 8 + 4 + ... + (n / (m-1) - 0) / m + (m-1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is undefined.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` starting from 2 up to `m`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum based on the given logic inside the loop, where `g` is calculated and added to `ans` until `count` reaches `m + 1`. The `countmins` remains 0 as it is only updated when `g` is less than `countmins`, which does not happen in the final iteration.
