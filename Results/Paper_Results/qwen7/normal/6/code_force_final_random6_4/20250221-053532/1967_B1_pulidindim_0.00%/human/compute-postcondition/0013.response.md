Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / count - countmins`.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decreased by `countmins`. Given that `countmins` is 0, `g` is updated to `n / count`. The other variables remain unchanged.
