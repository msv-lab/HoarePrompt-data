Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` is at least 6, `n` is an input integer, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is calculated as follows: `ans = n + (2 - 1)/3 + 1 + (n/4 - 3)/5 + 1 + (n/5 - 7)/6 + 1 + ... + (n/(m-1) - (m-4))/(m) + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `n/m - (m-1)`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` also stays as 1. The variable `m` must be at least 6 for the loop to run three times initially, and it can run further depending on the condition inside the loop. The variable `count` will be `m + 1` after the loop completes. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum based on the given formula, and `countmins` and `g` are updated according to the loop's logic.
