Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0)`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 0`, `g` is now `n / 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in. All other variables retain their previous values.
