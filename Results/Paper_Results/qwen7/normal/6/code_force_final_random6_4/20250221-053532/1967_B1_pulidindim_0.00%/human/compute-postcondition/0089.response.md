Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0)`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 0`**

Explanation: The line `countmins = count - 1` updates the value of `countmins` by subtracting 1 from the current value of `count`. Initially, `count` is 3, so after executing this line, `count` becomes 2 and `countmins` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
