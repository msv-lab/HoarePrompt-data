Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 1, `m` is at least 6, `n` is an input integer, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is calculated as follows: `ans = n + (2 - 1) / 3 + 1 + (n / 4 - 3) / 5 + 1 + (n / 5 - 7) / 6 + 1 + ... + (n / (m-1) - (m-5)) / m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `n / m - (m - 1)`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` starting from 1 up to `m`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum based on the formula provided for each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`countmins` and `g`) are updated according to the loop's logic, with `countmins` being `m - 1` and `g` being `n / count - countmins` for the last iteration.
