Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for result in results:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `result`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times.
   - `result` is the third element in the list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, the `result` variable needs to be set to the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` is a list of three elements and `result` was the third element in the previous iteration, the next element would be the first element in the list (index 0).

4. **Adjust the state**: To prepare for the next iteration, `result` should be set to the first element of the `results` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `results` remains the same (a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times).
- `result` is now the first element in the `results` list.

State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times, `result` is the first element in the list**
