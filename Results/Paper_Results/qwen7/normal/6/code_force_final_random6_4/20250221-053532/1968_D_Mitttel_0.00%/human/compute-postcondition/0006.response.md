State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, results is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is just a placeholder) and the variable `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. The initial state provides that `index` is 1, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, and `results` is an empty list.
4. Since the loop depends on `t` being greater than 0 to execute, `t` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.
