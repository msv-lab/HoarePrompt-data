### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
1. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The function correctly uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles in the permutation. When a cycle is detected, it sets `cycle_start` to the step count at which the cycle begins.
   - The cycle length is calculated as `steps - cycle_start`.
   - The function correctly calculates the score for one cycle and multiplies it by the number of full cycles, then adds the score for the remaining steps.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - For non-cyclic parts, the function correctly accumulates the score for each step.
   - For cyclic parts, the function correctly calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Score Comparison**:
  - The function correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Handling**:
  - The function correctly reads the input from standard input in chunks and processes each test case separately.
  - It correctly handles the input format and extracts the necessary values for each test case.
- **Result Collection**:
  - The function collects the results for each test case and prints them in the required format.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The cycle detection logic is correct. It identifies cycles and handles them appropriately by calculating the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.
   - The use of `visited` to detect cycles is efficient and works as expected.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation logic is correct for both non-cyclic and cyclic parts.
   - The function correctly simulates the game for up to `k` turns.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the input in chunks and processes each test case separately.
   - The function correctly handles the input format and extracts the necessary values for each test case.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the required format, and the results are printed correctly.

### Correctness Check

- **Cycle Detection and Handling**: Correct.
- **Score Calculation**: Correct.
- **Input Handling**: Correct.
- **Output**: Correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game for each test case. All functions handle the input and logic as specified in the problem statement.
