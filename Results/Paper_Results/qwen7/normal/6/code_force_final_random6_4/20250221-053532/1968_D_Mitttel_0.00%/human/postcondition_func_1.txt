The function `calculate_score` accepts an integer `start_pos` and calculates a cumulative score based on the list `a` and the permutation `p`. It traverses the list `a` from `start_pos` to `current_pos` according to the permutation `p` for `k` steps. If a cycle is detected during traversal, it calculates the score contributed by the cycle and updates the total score accordingly. The function returns the final accumulated score.
