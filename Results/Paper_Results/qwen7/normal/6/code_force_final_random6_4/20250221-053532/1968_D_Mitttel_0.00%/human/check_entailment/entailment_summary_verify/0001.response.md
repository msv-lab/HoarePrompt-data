### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description, function summaries, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The problem involves a permutation game where two players (Bodya and Sasha) take turns moving along a permutation array `p` and collecting scores from an array `a`.
- The goal is to determine the winner after `k` turns, considering both players try to maximize their scores.

#### Function Summaries Recap
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Takes inputs `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - Calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - Compares their scores and returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - Takes a starting position `start_pos`.
   - Simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
   - Detects cycles in the permutation and optimizes the score calculation for cyclic parts.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from stdin for multiple test cases.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - **Cycle Detection**: Correctly uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles.
   - **Score Calculation**:
     - Non-cyclic part: Adds the score for each turn.
     - Cyclic part: Calculates the score for one cycle and multiplies it by the number of full cycles, then adds the score for the remaining steps.
   - **Efficiency**: The cycle detection and handling are efficient and work as expected.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Score Comparison**: Correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - **Return Values**: Returns 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: Correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Result Collection**: Collects the results for each test case and prints them.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The cycle detection logic is correct and efficiently handles cyclic permutations.
   - The score calculation for cyclic parts is accurate.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation logic is correct for both non-cyclic and cyclic parts.
   - The function correctly simulates the game for up to `k` turns.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct and processes the input in chunks.
   - Each test case is processed independently and correctly.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the required format, and the results are printed correctly.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, all functions handle the input and logic as specified in the problem statement. The program correctly determines the winner of the game for each test case.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
