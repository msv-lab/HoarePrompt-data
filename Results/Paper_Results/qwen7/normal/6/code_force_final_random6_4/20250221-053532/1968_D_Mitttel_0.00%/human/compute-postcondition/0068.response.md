Output State: **`full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remainder_steps - 1`, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged.**

This means that the `score` variable is incremented by the value of `a[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `remainder_steps`, `cycle_score`, and `current_pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
