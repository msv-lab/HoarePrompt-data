Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read` which reads all input from standard input in one go.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, which changes how input is read but does not affect the values of the other variables.
