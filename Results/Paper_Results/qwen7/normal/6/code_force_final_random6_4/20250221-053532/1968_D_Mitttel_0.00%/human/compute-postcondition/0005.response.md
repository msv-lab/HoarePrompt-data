Output State: **`index` is 1; `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `results = []` initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `index` or `t`. Therefore, `index` remains 1 and `t` retains its initial value from `data[0]`.
