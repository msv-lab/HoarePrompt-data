Output State: `index` is `18 + 3 * n + 8 + 2 * n`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]` converted to an integer, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` appended with the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated for each iteration of the loop, `PS` is now `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers, and `a` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, with `result` being the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the last iteration.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The `index` variable will be at the position right after the last processed data, `PB` and `PS` will hold their latest values from the data, `n` and `k` will reflect the latest values from the data as well, `t` will be 1 indicating the loop has finished, `results` will contain the results of `func_1` for each iteration, and `p` and `a` will be lists of integers derived from the data according to the loop's logic.
