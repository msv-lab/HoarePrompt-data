Output State: **`index` is 3, `k` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.**

The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `k`. Since `index` is initially 2, `index + 1` is 3, so `k` becomes an integer value from `data[3]`. The other variables (`index`, `n`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
