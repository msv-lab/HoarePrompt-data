Postcondition: **If a cycle is detected, `cycle_start` will be the step count at which the cycle began, and the function will return the accumulated `score` up to the point where the cycle was detected. Otherwise, `score` will be increased by the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration from `remainder_steps` down to 1, and `current_pos` will be updated to the final value after executing the loop `remainder_steps` times, with all other variables remaining unchanged.**
