Output State: **`index` is 2, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` updates the variable `n` to be the integer value from `data` at the index specified by `index`. Initially, `index` is 1, so `n` becomes the integer value from `data[1]`. The other variables (`t`, `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `index` is updated to 2 (since we accessed `data[1]`), `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `t` remains an integer value from `data[0]`, and `results` stays as an empty list.
