Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `index` is `18 + 3 * n + 4`
   - `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`
   - `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`
   - `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (integer value from `data[0]`)
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new result
   - `PS` is now an integer value from `data[index + 3]`
   - `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`
   - `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
   - All other variables (`index`, `PB`, `k`, `n`, `results`, `PS`, `p`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`index` is `18 + 3 * n + 4`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` is 1 (must be greater than 0), `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new result, `PS` is now an integer value from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.**
