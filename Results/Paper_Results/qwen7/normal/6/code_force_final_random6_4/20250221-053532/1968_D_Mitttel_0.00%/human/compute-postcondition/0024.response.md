Output State: **`index` is `18 + n + n + 4`, `PB` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `k` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is an integer value from `data[1]`, `t` must be greater than 0 (integer value from `data[0]`), `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `PS` is now an integer value from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from `index - n` to `index - n + n` into integers.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the value of `p` by converting the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
