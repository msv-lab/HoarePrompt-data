Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the scores for both players based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. It uses the `calculate_score` function to compute the scores and then compares them to determine the winner.
2. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function accurately computes the score for a given starting position by simulating the game for `k` steps. It handles both non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios correctly. If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score contributed by the cycle and updates the total score accordingly.
3. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly reads the input for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. The logic for reading input and processing multiple test cases is sound.

Given the detailed analysis of each function, the overall program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Each function performs its intended task without errors, and the program as a whole meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
