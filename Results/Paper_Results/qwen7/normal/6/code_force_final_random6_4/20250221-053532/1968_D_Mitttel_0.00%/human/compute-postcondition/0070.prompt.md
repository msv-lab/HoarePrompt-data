Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score`, `cycle_score` will be increased by the sum of the values of `a` from each position within the cycle, as determined by the permutation `p`, and `cycle_pos` will be updated to the final position within the cycle after all iterations. All other variables (`cycle_start`, `steps`, `current_pos`, `visited`, `cycle_length`) will remain unchanged from their last known state after the third iteration.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(remainder_steps):
    score += a[current_pos - 1]
    current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` remains unchanged, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decreased by 1, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to the value of `p[current_pos - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `full_cycles` remains unchanged, `remaining_steps` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remainder_steps - 1`, `score` is increased by `a[current_pos - 1]`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
