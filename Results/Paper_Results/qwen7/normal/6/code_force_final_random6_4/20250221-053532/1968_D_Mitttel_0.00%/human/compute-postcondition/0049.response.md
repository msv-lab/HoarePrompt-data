Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times.
- `result` is the first element in the list `results`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the first element of the list `results`, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)**
