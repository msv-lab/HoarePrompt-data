Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), PB and PS (positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n), and two lists p and a (where p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers representing the array a, with each integer in both lists being between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function processes the provided parameters but does not return a value based on the given description.
