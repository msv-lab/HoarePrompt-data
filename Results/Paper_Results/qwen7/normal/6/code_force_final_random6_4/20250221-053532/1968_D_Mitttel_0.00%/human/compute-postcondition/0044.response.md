Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for result in results:`.
   - The only object being iterated over here is `result`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `results`:**
   - According to the given state before the loop, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times.
   - Therefore, `results` initially contains three elements, each being the return value of `func_1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `results`.
   - For each iteration, `result` takes on one of the three values in `results`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since `result` is the only object being iterated over, we need to ensure that `results` is correctly initialized as described.
   - No other variables need adjustment because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State Description:**
   - `results` must be a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times**
