Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `result` which iterates over the `results` list.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `results` list. Once all elements are processed, the loop terminates.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times.
   - This means `results` currently contains three elements.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `results`, at the end of each iteration, `result` will take the next element from the list.
   - After the first iteration, `result` will have taken the first element from the list.
   - After the second iteration, `result` will have taken the second element from the list.
   - For the third iteration, `result` will take the third element from the list.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - After the second iteration, `result` will have taken the second element from the list.
   - Therefore, for the third iteration, `result` will take the third element from the list.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next (third) iteration should be:

**State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` repeated three times, `result` is the third element in the list**
