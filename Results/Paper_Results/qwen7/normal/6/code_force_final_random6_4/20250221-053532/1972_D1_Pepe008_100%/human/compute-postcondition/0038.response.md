Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated within the loop plus additional increments based on the specified conditions, `info` is a list of strings split from the input**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the `info` list to `a` and the second element of the `info` list to `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `suma` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The `info` list remains the same as it was not modified.
