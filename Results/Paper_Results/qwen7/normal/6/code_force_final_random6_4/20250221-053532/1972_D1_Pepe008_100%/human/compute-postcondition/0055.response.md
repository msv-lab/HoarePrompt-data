Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 1`, `x` is `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1)`, `suma` is `suma + 1`**

Explanation: The code `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
