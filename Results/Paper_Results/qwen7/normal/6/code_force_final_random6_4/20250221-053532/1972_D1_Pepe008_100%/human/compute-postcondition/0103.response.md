Output State: `t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `int(info[1]) + int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration where `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, plus an additional 1 for each iteration where both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains 2, `a` and `b` retain their initial values, `i` will be set to `int(info[1]) + int(info[1]) + 1` (which is `2 * int(info[1]) + 1`), `x` will be the last calculated value based on the final `i` value, and `suma` will be the total sum of all valid `x` values plus an extra 1 for each specific condition met during the loop iterations.
