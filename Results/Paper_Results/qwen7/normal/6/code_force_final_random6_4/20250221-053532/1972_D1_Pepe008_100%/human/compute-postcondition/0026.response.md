Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. However, the values of `a`, `i`, and `suma` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, and the other variables (`t` and `b`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` based on the given formula, while keeping the other variables in their initial or unchanged states.
