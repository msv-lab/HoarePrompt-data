Postcondition: `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `x` + 1, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and the current value of `x` satisfies `((a - i * (i - 1)) % i**2 == 0)`. If the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i**2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i**2 == 0` is true, then `suma` is incremented by 1.
