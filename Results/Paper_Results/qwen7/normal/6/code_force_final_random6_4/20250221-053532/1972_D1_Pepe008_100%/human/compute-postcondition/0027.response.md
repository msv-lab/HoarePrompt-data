Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i, `suma` is equal to `suma` + x**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given that `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, the value of `suma` is updated to its current value plus the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
