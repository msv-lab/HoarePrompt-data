Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). Given that `i` is `b + 1`, and `b` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2. The value of `a` remains `int(info[0])`. The value of `t` and `b` remain unchanged. The updated value of `x` is calculated using the new formula, but since the exact value of `a` is not specified, `x` is expressed in terms of `a` and `i`.
