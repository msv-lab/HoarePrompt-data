Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `suma` is `x + 1`, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is incremented by 1, making the new value of `suma` equal to the original value of `suma` plus 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
