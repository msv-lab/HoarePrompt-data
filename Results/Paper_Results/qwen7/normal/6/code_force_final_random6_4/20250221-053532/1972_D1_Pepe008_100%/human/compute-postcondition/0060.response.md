Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `b + 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 1
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`
   - `b` is `int(info[1])`
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `x` is `(a - (k + 1) * (k + 1)) // (k + 1)`
   - `suma` is incremented by 1 if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is true.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `b + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 2`.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `t` remains 1.
   - `a` remains `int(info[0])`.
   - `b` remains `int(info[1])`.
   - `i` is now `k + 2`.
   - `x` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`, but since the calculation of `x` is dependent on `a` and `i`, and `a` is unchanged, `x` becomes `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 2)) // (k + 2)`.
   - `suma` remains unchanged unless the condition in the loop body is met, but since no information about the condition being met or not is given, we assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 2`, `x` is `(a - (k + 2) * (k + 2)) // (k + 2)`, and `suma` is unchanged**.
