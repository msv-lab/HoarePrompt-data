Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is `(int(info[0]) - int(info[1]) * (int(info[1]) - 1)) // (int(info[1]) - 1)`, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding the value of `x` to it. Since the exact value of `suma` before this operation is not specified, we only know that `suma` is now the sum of its previous value and `x`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
