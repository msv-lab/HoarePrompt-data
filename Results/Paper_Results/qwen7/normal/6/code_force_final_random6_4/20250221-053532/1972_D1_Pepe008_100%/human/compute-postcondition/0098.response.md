Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `x + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is incremented by 1. Initially, `suma` was equal to `x`. After the increment, `suma` becomes `x + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
