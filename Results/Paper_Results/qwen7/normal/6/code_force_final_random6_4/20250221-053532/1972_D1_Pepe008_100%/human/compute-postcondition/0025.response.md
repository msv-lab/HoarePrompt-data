Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `b + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `b + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is `0`.
   - `a` is an integer value derived from `info[0]`.
   - `b` must be at least `1`.
   - `suma` is equal to `suma` + `1`.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
   - If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then `x` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `k < b`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Since `b` must be at least `1`, and the loop continues until `i` reaches `b + 1`, `b` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains `0`.
   - `a` remains the same integer value derived from `info[0]`.
   - `suma` is incremented by `1` each iteration, so it will be `suma + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `x` will be recalculated for the new value of `i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains `0`.
   - `a` remains the same integer value derived from `info[0]`.
   - `b` remains at least `1`.
   - `suma` will be `suma + 1`.
   - `x` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (`i = k + 1`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1, `x` is (a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1)**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we represent it as `i` in the next iteration. Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1, `x` is (a - (i + 1) * i) // (i + 1)**
