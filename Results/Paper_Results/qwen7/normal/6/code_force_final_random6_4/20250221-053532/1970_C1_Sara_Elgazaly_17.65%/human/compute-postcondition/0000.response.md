Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `y` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers. These integers are assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
