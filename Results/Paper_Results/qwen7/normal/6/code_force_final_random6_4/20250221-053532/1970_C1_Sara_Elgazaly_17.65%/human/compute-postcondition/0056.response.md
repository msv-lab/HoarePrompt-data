Output State: **`s` is False, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[x]` now contains one less element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `s`, `a`, `b`, or `lst[a]`. It also does not affect the value of `x` since the assignment `x = y` was done before the `break` statement, and `x` is equal to `y`. The only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block we were inside.
