Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[b]` contains the value `a`, and `x` must be greater than 1.**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs, splits them into integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`. This does not affect the value of `lst[b]` or `x`. Therefore, the state of `lst[b]` and `x` remains unchanged from the initial state.
