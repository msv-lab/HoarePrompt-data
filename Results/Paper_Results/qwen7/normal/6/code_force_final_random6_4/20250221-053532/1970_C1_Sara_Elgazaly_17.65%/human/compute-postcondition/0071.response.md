Output State: **`lst[x]' is a list with one less element, `x` is the last element of `lst[x]' before popping.** 

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `y`, which was the last element of the list `lst[x]` before it was popped. The length of the list `lst[x]` is now one less because the last element was removed.
