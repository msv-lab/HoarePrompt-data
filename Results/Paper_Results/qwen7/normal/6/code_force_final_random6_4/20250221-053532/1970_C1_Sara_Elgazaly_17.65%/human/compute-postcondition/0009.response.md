Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[b]` now contains `[a]`, and `x` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `lst[b]`. Initially, `lst[b]` contains `[b]`. After executing the line `lst[b].append(a)`, `lst[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`, making it `[b, a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
