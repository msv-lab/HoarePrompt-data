Postcondition: `s` is False, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping, and if `lst[y]` is not empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
