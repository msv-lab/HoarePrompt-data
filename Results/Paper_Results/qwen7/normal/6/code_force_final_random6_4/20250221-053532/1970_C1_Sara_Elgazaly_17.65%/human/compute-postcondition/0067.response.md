Output State: **`lst[x]` is a list with one element less than before, `x` is equal to `y`, and `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before popping, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `lst[x]`, `x`, or `y`. It only indicates that the program has exited the loop or conditional block it was in.
