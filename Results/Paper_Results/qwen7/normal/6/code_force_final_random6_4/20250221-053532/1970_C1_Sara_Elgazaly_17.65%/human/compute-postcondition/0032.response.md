Output State: **`s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` contains a list of integers (with one less element), `lst[b]` remains unchanged, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it, and `lst[y]` is not empty.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. This means `lst[x]` now has one less element, while `lst[b]` remains unchanged. The other variables (`s`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`) remain as described in the initial state.
