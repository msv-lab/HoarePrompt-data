Postcondition: `s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` both contain a list of integers representing all the nodes connected to `a` and `b` respectively, `x` is now equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
