Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number; `b` is an integer equal to the second input number; `lst[b]` now contains the value `a` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `lst[b]`. Initially, `lst[b]` contains the value `b` (from the initial state). After executing the code, `lst[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`.
