Output State: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and the loop has terminated because `i` is no longer less than or equal to `j`.

To explain this in natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `i` and `j` will be such that `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the last index of `arr`. The loop terminates when `i` exceeds `j`, meaning all elements in the array have been compared in pairs from the start and end moving towards the center.
