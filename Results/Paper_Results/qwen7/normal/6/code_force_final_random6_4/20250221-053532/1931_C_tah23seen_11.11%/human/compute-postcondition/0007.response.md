Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context (implied by the initial state's description). The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
