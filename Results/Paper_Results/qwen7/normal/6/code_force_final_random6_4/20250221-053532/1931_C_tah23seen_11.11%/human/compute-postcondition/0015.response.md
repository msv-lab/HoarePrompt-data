Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, or `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2. If the condition `arr[i] == arr[j]` is true, then `i` is set to 1 and `j` is set to the length of `arr` - 2. Otherwise, `i` remains 0 and `j` remains the length of `arr` - 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
