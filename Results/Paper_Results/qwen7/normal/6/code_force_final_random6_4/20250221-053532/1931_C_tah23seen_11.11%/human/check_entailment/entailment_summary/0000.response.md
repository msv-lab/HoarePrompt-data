Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Check for Consecutive Equal Elements**: 
   - The function correctly checks for consecutive equal elements starting from both ends of the list and moving towards the center.
   - However, if it finds such elements, it returns the distance between them (`j - i + 1`), which is not the optimal solution.

2. **Handling Non-Uniform Arrays**:
   - The function returns 1 if no consecutive equal elements are found after the initial check. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of making all elements equal using the allowed operation.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The goal is to minimize the cost of operations. The optimal strategy would be to find the most frequent element in the array and change all other elements to this most frequent element.
   - The provided function does not implement this strategy.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost of changing elements from index `i` to `j` to a value `x` is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
   - The function should identify the most frequent element and calculate the total cost required to change all other elements to this most frequent element.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
