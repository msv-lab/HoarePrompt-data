### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to make all elements of the array equal using the minimum number of operations.
- Each operation involves setting a subarray from index `i` to `j` to a value `x`, and the cost of this operation is `(j - i + 1)`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
   - It uses a two-pointer approach to find the first pair of unequal elements from both ends of the array.
   - If the array is already uniform, it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it returns the distance between the first and last different elements.

2. **Annotated Code Explanation**:
   - The function iterates from both ends of the array towards the center.
   - If it finds a pair of unequal elements, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, it means the array is already uniform.
   - If the loop breaks, it further checks if the remaining elements are uniform and calculates the cost accordingly.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Uniform Arrays**: The function correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform and returns 0.
2. **Finding the Minimum Cost**: The function does not correctly identify the optimal segment to set to a uniform value. It only considers the distance between the first and last different elements, which is not always the optimal solution.

#### Example Analysis:
1. **Example 1**:
   ```
   6
   1 2 3 4 5 1
   ```
   - Correct Output: 4 (Set [2, 4] to 1)
   - Function Output: 4 (Incorrect, should be 6)

2. **Example 2**:
   ```
   6
   4 3 2 7 1 1
   ```
   - Correct Output: 6 (Set [0, 3] to 1)
   - Function Output: 6 (Incorrect, should be 6)

#### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. It fails to consider the optimal segment to set to a uniform value, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the problem as described and does not compute the minimum cost correctly in various scenarios.
