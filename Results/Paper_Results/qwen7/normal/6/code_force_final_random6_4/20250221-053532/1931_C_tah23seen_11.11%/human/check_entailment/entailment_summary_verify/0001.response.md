### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation where we can set a subarray to a single value `x`. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1(arr)` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal, but it has several issues.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array respectively.
   - It checks if the elements at `i` and `j` are the same. If they are, it moves both pointers inward.
   - If the elements at `i` and `j` are different, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If the pointers cross each other (`i > j`), it means all elements are already the same, so it returns 0.
   - If the elements at `i` and `i+1` are the same, it moves the pointer `i` inward.
   - Finally, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.

4. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal. It only checks for adjacent elements being the same and does not consider the possibility of setting a subarray to a specific value `x` to minimize the cost.
   - The logic inside the function does not handle the scenario where the array needs to be divided into multiple segments to make all elements equal.
   - The function returns 0 if all elements are the same, which is correct, but it does not handle the general case where the array needs to be split into segments.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the function returns either 0, the difference between the indices of two consecutive equal elements plus one, or 1. However, the function does not correctly implement this logic. It does not handle the case where the array needs to be split into multiple segments to make all elements equal.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to account for the optimal way to use the operation to make all elements equal. The function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly identify the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1(arr)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal. It fails to handle the general case where the array needs to be split into multiple segments to achieve the goal.
