Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input, reading the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the array (`n`), and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - It then enters a loop that compares `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`. If they are equal, it increments `i` and decrements `j`. This loop continues until `i` is greater than `j`, indicating that all elements have been checked in pairs from both ends moving towards the center.
   - If `i` becomes greater than `j`, the function returns 0, which is correct because it means all elements in the array are already equal.
   - If the loop exits without `i` being greater than `j`, it means there is at least one pair of unequal elements. The function then enters another loop that increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This loop ensures that all consecutive equal elements are handled.
   - Finally, the function checks if `j` is not the last index of the array. If it is not, it returns `j - i + 1`, which is the cost of making all elements from `i` to `j` equal. If `j` is the last index, it returns 1, which is the cost of making the last element equal to the previous one.

3. **Output**: The function returns the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the function logic appears to be correct for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
