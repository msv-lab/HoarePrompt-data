You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and the loop has terminated because `i` is no longer less than or equal to `j`.
    #
    #To explain this in natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `i` and `j` will be such that `i` is 1 and `j` is the second last index of `arr`, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the last index of `arr`. The loop terminates when `i` exceeds `j`, meaning all elements in the array have been compared in pairs from the start and end moving towards the center.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `i` is 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and the loop has not terminated because `i` is still less than or equal to `j`.
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be one less than the length of `arr`, and `j` will be `i - 1`. Additionally, every element from `arr[i]` to the end of the array must be equal, as the loop continues to increment `i` as long as `arr[i]` equals `arr[i + 1]`.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between index j and i plus one, which is the distance between two consecutive elements in the list `arr` that are equal.
    #State: `i` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Additionally, `j` is equal to the length of `arr` - 1
    return j - i
    #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. The function returns 0 if no two consecutive equal elements are found. If two consecutive equal elements are found, it returns the difference between their indices plus one. If no such elements exist, it returns 1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between index j and i plus one, which is the distance between two consecutive elements in the list `arr` that are equal.

Case_3: The program returns 1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
