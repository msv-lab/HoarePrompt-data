Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. **Current states before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
   - Given `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= j`.

4. **Check the current state of `j`**:
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
   - Since the length of any array is always a non-negative integer, `j` (which is `len(arr) - 1`) will always be a non-negative integer and thus `0 <= j` will always be true.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current state of `i` (0) and `j` (length of `arr` - 1) already satisfy the loop condition `i <= j`.
   - No adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**
