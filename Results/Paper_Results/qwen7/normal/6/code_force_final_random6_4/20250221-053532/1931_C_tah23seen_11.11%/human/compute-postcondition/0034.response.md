Output State: `i` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be one less than the length of `arr`, and `j` will be `i - 1`. Additionally, every element from `arr[i]` to the end of the array must be equal, as the loop continues to increment `i` as long as `arr[i]` equals `arr[i + 1]`.
