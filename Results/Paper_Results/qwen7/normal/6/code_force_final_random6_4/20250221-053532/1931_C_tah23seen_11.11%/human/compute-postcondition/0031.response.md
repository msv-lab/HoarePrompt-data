Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is 3 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 2 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
- `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

### Loop Condition
- The loop continues as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

### Analysis
- For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must still hold true.
- We need to ensure that `i` and `i + 1` still point to elements in the array that are equal.

### Possible Scenarios
1. **Case 1: `i` is 3 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2**
   - Here, `i + 1` would be 4.
   - We need to ensure that `arr[3] == arr[4]`.

2. **Case 2: `i` is 2 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**
   - Here, `i + 1` would be 3.
   - We need to ensure that `arr[2] == arr[3]`.

### Conclusion
In both cases, the loop will continue as long as the elements at positions `i` and `i + 1` are equal. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr[i]` is still equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

### Final State
- The state needs to be adjusted such that `arr[i]` is still equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 3 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, or `i` is 2 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
