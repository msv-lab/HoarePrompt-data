To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions given in the loop head and the current state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2.

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible values for `i` and `j`:

- If `i` is 0, then `j` can be either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2.
- If `i` is 1, then `j` must be the length of `arr` - 2 (since if `i` is 1 and `j` were the length of `arr` - 1, the condition `i <= j` would not hold).

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `i <= j` must still be true. Let's examine each case:

#### Case 1: `i` is 0
- If `i` is 0, `j` can be either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2.
- For the loop to continue, `j` must be the length of `arr` - 1 (since if `j` were the length of `arr` - 2, the condition `i <= j` would no longer hold).

#### Case 2: `i` is 1
- If `i` is 1, `j` must be the length of `arr` - 2.
- This already satisfies the condition `i <= j`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `i <= j` holds true. Specifically, if `i` is 0, `j` must be the length of `arr` - 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**
