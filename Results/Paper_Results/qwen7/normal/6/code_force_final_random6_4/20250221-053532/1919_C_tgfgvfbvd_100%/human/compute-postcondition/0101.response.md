Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be `n`.
- `a` and `b` will be swapped compared to their initial values after the last iteration.
- `c` will be incremented by `n-2` (since the loop runs `n` times and `c` is incremented each time).

The print statement is simply printing the value of `c`.

Since `c` is incremented `n` times during the loop, the final value of `c` will be its initial value plus `n-2`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `c` after the loop, which is `c_initial + n - 2`.

Output: **c_initial + n - 2**
