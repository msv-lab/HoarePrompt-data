Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity
Code of the loop:
for x in range(n):
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    if l[x] <= a:
        a = l[x]
    elif l[x] <= b:
        b = l[x]
    else:
        a = l[x]
        c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` and `b` are swapped, meaning `a` is now equal to the original value of `b` and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. `n` remains greater than 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to the original value of `a`, then `a` is updated to the original value of `b`, `b` is updated to the original value of `a`, and `c` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the original value of `l[x]`, `b` is updated to the original value of `a`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `c` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` becomes the value of `l[x]` and `b` becomes the value of the original `a`. `n` remains greater than 0, and `c` is increased by 1 if the condition `a > b` does not hold true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` becomes the value of `l[x+1]` and `b` becomes the value of the original `a`. `c` is increased by 1 if `a` is not greater than `b`, and `n` is greater than 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` becomes the value of `l[x]` and `b` remains the original value of `a`. Otherwise, `a` becomes the value of `l[x+1]` and `b` becomes the value of `l[x]`. In both cases, `c` is increased by 1 and `n` is greater than 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
