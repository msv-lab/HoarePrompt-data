Output State: **`c` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is equal to `a`.**

The code `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is also equal to `a`, meaning both `a` and `b` have the same value. After swapping, `a` takes the original value of `b`, and `b` takes the original value of `a`. Since their original values were the same, swapping them does not change their values. Therefore, `a` remains equal to `b`, and `b` remains equal to `a`. The values of `c` and `x` remain unchanged.
