Output State: **`x` is `n`, `a` is now equal to `l[x]`, `b` and `a` are swapped, `c` is increased by 1 (i.e., `c = c + 1`), and `c` is now equal to `c + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was previously increased by 1 due to the swap operation, it is now increased by 1 again. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
