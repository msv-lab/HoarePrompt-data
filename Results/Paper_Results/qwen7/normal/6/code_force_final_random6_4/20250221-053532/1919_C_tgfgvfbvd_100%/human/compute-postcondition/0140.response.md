Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the original value of `a`, `c` is increased by 1 if `a` is not greater than `b`, `n` is greater than 0**.

Explanation: The line `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. So, `a` now holds the original value of `b`, and `b` now holds the original value of `a`. The condition `a > b` is checked to see if `c` should be increased by 1, but since the values of `a` and `b` have just swapped, the new value of `a` is not necessarily greater than the new value of `b`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
