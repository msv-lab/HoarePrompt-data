Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value, which is used as the range for the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This means that the input value (which determines the number of iterations of the loop) should be within this range.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range.
   - We don't need to adjust any other variables because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
