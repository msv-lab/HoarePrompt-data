You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Example

Input

    5
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5
    
    8
    
    8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3
    
    5
    
    3 3 3 3 3
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    3
    1
    0
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (float('inf'), float('inf'))
        c = 0
        for x in range(n):
            if a > b:
                (a, b) = (b, a)
            if l[x] <= a:
                a = l[x]
            elif l[x] <= b:
                b = l[x]
            else:
                a = l[x]
                c += 1
        print(c)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it finds the smallest and second smallest numbers in the list and counts how many numbers in the list are greater than these two smallest numbers. The function prints the count for each test case and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program does not split the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) such that every element of \(a\) is either in \(s\) or \(t\). Instead, it seems to be trying to find the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array non-decreasing, which is not the same as splitting the array into two subsequences and calculating the penalties for each subsequence.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
2
5
1 2 3 4 5
2
2 1
```

The expected output based on the problem description would be:
```
0
0
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
3
0
```

This is because the program does not correctly handle the splitting of the array into two subsequences. It tries to find the minimum number of changes needed to make the array non-decreasing, which is not the same as finding the optimal split and calculating the penalties for each subsequence.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
