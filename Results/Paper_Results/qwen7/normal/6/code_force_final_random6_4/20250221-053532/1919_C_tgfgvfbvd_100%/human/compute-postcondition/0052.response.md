Output State: **`c` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the value of `n-1`, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest value in the list `l` if they are distinct, otherwise `a` equals `b` and both are the minimum value in the list `l`, and the input value controlling the loop is `n-2`.**

This means that the loop will now run `n-2` times instead of `n-1` times because the input value that controls the loop has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
