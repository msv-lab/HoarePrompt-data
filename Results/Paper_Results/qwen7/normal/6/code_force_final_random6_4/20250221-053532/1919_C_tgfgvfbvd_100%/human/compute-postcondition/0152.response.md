Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop, `a` will be the minimum value in the list `l`.
- `b` will be the second minimum value in the list `l`.
- The variable `c` will be equal to the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which represents the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both the minimum (`a`) and the second minimum (`b`) values in the list.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in list l that are greater than both a and b)**
