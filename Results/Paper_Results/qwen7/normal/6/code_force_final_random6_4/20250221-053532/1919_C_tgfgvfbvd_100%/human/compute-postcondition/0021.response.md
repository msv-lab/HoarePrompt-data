Postcondition: **`c` is 0 if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is 1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is equal to `b`, and `b` is equal to `a` if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `b` is equal to `l[x]` and `a` is equal to `l[x]`.**
