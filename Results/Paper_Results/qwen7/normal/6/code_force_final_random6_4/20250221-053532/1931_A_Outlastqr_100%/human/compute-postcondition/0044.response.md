Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'aaa', and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the string `word`. Since the exact value of `alphabet[n - 3]` is not given, we assume it results in the character `'a'` (commonly used in such examples). Thus, `word` becomes `'aaa'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
