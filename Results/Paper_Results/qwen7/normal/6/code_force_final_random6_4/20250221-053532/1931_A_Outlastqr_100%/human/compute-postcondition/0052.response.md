Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer (the last input provided by the user during the loop's execution), and `word` is determined based on the final value of `n`.**

- If `n` is greater than 52, `word` will be `'zz'`.
- If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `word` will be `'az'`.
- If `n` is 27, `word` will be `'aay'`.
- If `n` is between 3 and 27 (inclusive), `word` will be `'aaa'` repeated `n` times.

The variable `i` will have the value of the total number of iterations minus one, which is `int(input()) - 1`.
