You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer (the last input provided by the user during the loop's execution), and `word` is determined based on the final value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Based on the value of `n`, it constructs and prints a specific string `word`. The function does not return any value but prints the constructed string for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program imports `string` to access the lowercase Latin alphabet.
   - It defines a function `func()` which will handle the logic for decoding the encoded words.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded.

4. **Conditional Statements**:
   - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This covers the case where the third character is beyond 'z'.
   - If `n > 27`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This covers the case where the second character is beyond 'z'.
   - If `n == 27`, the word is set to `'aay'`. This is a special case.
   - Otherwise, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Verification of Decoding Logic

Let's verify the logic with some examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 24`
  - According to the problem, the word "cat" encodes to 3 + 1 + 20 = 24.
  - The program should return "aav" (since 'a' is at index 1, 'a' is at index 1, and 'v' is at index 22).
  - The program correctly returns "aav".

- **Example 2**: `n = 70`
  - The word "rzz" encodes to 18 + 26 + 26 = 70.
  - The program correctly returns "rzz".

- **Example 3**: `n = 3`
  - The word "aaa" encodes to 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
  - The program correctly returns "aaa".

- **Example 4**: `n = 55`
  - The word "czz" encodes to 3 + 26 + 26 = 55.
  - The program correctly returns "czz".

- **Example 5**: `n = 48`
  - The word "auz" encodes to 1 + 21 + 26 = 48.
  - The program correctly returns "auz".

### Conclusion

After verifying the logic with multiple examples, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the decoding logic as specified in the problem statement.
