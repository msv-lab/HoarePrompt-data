Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles different ranges of `n` values and constructs the corresponding lexicographically smallest word.
2. For `n > 52`, the word is formed by taking the character at position `n - 53` (0-based indexing) and appending 'zz'. This covers words like "rzz" and "azz".
3. For `27 < n <= 52`, the word is formed by taking 'a', the character at position `n - 28`, and appending 'z'. This covers words like "czz" and "bzz".
4. For `n == 27`, the word is explicitly set to "aay". This is the correct word for the given condition.
5. For `n <= 26`, the word is formed by taking 'aa' and the character at position `n - 3`. This covers words like "aaa" and "aaz".

Given the constraints and the logic, the program correctly generates the lexicographically smallest word for each test case based on the provided encoding rules.

Correctness: **True**
