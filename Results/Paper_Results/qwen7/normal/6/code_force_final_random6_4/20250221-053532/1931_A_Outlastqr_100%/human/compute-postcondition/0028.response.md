Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `word` is a string containing 'az', `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code appends the characters `'a'`, the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and `'z'` to the string `word`. Since the initial value of `word` is an empty string, after executing the code, `word` becomes `'az'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
