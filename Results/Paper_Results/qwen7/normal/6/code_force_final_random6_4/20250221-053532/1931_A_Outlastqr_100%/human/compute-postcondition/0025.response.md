Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is defined based on the value of `n`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t`, `word`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100, `word` is defined based on the original value of `n`, and `i` remains 1.
