Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, for the input `n = 3`, the expected output is `aaa` but the program outputs `aay`. This is because the program logic for `n <= 27` does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word. The correct approach should ensure that all three letters are 'a' when the sum is less than or equal to 27, which the current implementation fails to do.
