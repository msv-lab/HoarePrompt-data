Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the constraints for \( t \) and \( n \).
2. The logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word based on the encoded value \( n \) needs to be analyzed for correctness.

Let's break down the logic:

- If \( n > 52 \):
  - This means the encoded value is greater than the maximum possible value for a two-letter word ("zz") which is \( 26 + 26 = 52 \). Therefore, the third letter must be the one corresponding to \( n - 53 \), and the other two letters should be 'z'.
  - Example: For \( n = 54 \), the word is "azz".

- If \( n > 27 \):
  - This means the encoded value is between the range of a two-letter word ("yy") and a three-letter word starting with 'a' ("azz"). The second letter is 'a', and the third letter is the one corresponding to \( n - 28 \).
  - Example: For \( n = 30 \), the word is "aaz".

- If \( n == 27 \):
  - This is a special case where the word is "aay".

- If \( n \leq 26 \):
  - This means the encoded value is within the range of a three-letter word starting with 'aa'. The third letter is the one corresponding to \( n - 3 \).
  - Example: For \( n = 5 \), the word is "aaz".

Given these conditions, let's verify the examples provided in the problem statement:

- For \( n = 24 \): The word is "aav" (since \( 3 + 1 + 20 = 24 \)).
- For \( n = 70 \): The word is "rzz" (since \( 18 + 26 + 18 = 70 \)).
- For \( n = 3 \): The word is "aaa" (since \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)).
- For \( n = 55 \): The word is "czz" (since \( 3 + 26 + 26 = 55 \)).
- For \( n = 48 \): The word is "auz" (since \( 1 + 21 + 26 = 48 \)).

All these examples match the expected outputs.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
