Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. The values of `ans` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated states are as follows: `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1.
