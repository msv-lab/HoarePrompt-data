Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is converted to an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is originally a string from the input. The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer. The value of `T` remains False, and `n` remains an integer from the input (though its value is not specified).
