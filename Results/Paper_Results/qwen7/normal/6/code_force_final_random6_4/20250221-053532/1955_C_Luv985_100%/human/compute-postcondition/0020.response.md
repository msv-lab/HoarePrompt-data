Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `k` is reduced by 2 times the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the current value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`k`, `mi`, `a[l]`, and `a[r]`) remain unchanged from their initial state according to the precondition. Specifically, `a[l]` is 0, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, which is also the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
