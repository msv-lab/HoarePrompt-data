Output State: **`k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `ans` is increased by 2, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `l` is less than `r`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increases the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial postcondition already includes `ans` being increased by 1, after executing this line, `ans` is increased by another 1, making it increased by 2 in total. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged as per the initial postcondition.
