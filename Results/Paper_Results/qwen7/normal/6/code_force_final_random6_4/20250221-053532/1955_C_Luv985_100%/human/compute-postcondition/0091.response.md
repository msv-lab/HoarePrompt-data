Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `r` is calculated as `n - 1`, where `n` is an integer from the input. All other variables retain their initial states.
