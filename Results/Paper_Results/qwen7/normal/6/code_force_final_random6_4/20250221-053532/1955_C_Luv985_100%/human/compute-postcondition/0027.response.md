Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is reduced by 2 times the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, the current value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1.**

The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
