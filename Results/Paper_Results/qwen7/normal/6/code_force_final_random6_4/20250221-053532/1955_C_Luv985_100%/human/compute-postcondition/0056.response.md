Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `a[r]` equals 0. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2 while `ans` remains unchanged.
