Postcondition: `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi`, and `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` becomes 0; otherwise, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` becomes 0; otherwise, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
