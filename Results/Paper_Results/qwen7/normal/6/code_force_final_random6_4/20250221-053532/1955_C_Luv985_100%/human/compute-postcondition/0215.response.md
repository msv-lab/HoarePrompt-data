Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Here, `mi` is defined as the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation.
