Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which we assume is the same as `T` in this context) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, after executing the code, `T` will also be a positive integer within the same range. All other variables remain unchanged.
