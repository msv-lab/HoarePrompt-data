Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` applies the `int` function to each element in the list `a`, converting each string element into an integer. The variables `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
