Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is reduced by 2 times the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and the current value of `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by twice the value of `mi`, which is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
