Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (`k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged), `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list using map and lambda, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is set to 1 if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `l` remains 0 and `ans` remains 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l+1]` is reduced by `mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[l]` equals 0 and `a[r]` equals 0. If `a[r]` does not equal 0, `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`, `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`. If the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is not met, `k` remains unchanged, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and `ans` remains unchanged, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0, and `r` is decremented by 1 if `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, `t` is set to `k % 2`, and the loop or if statement is exited without changing `ans`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
