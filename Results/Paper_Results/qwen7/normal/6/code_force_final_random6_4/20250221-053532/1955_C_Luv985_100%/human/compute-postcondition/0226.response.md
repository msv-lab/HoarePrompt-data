Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2.**

The code `t = k % 2` calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by 2 and assigns it to `t`. Since `k` must be greater than 0, `t` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd. The value of `mi` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
