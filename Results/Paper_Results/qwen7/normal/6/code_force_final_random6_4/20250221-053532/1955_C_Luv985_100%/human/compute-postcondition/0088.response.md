Output State: **`T` is False, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string**.

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The variables `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
