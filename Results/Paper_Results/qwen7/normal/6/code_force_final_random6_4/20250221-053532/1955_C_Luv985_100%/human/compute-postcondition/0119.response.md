Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. Here, `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. Therefore, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. The other variables (`k` and `a[l]`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
