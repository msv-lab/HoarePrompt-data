You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of ships \( n \), the durability reduction limit \( k \), and a list of ship durabilities \( a \). It then iteratively reduces the durability of the ships from both ends towards the center until no further reductions can be made or \( k \) becomes zero. The function counts the total number of ships whose durability is reduced to zero and prints this count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship and stores them in a list `a`.

2. **Main Logic Loop:**
   - The program uses a while loop to process each test case.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to represent the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Attacking Ships:**
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are still ships to attack (`l < r`) and there are still attacks left (`k > 0`).
   - In each iteration, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - If the total durability of both ships (`mi * 2`) is less than or equal to the remaining attacks (`k`), it reduces the durability of both ships by `mi` and decreases `k` by `2 * mi`.
   - If either ship's durability reaches 0, it increments the `ans` counter and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - If the remaining attacks are not enough to reduce both ships' durability by `mi`, it calculates the exact number of attacks that can be made on the first ship (`t = k % 2`).
   - If the first ship's durability after these attacks is exactly 0, it increments the `ans` counter and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After exiting the main loop, if the left and right pointers meet (`l == r`), it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship (`ans += k >= a[l]`).

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the number of sunk ships `ans`.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `n=4, k=5, a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Output: `2`

- Initial Durabilities: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
- After 1st attack: `[0, 2, 4, 3]` (1 ship sunk, `ans = 1`)
- After 2nd attack: `[0, 1, 4, 3]` (1 more ship sunk, `ans = 2`)
- After 3rd attack: `[0, 1, 3, 3]` (no change, `ans = 2`)
- After 4th attack: `[0, 0, 3, 3]` (2 more ships sunk, `ans = 4`)
- After 5th attack: `[0, 0, 2, 3]` (1 more ship sunk, `ans = 5`)

The program correctly outputs `2` ships sunk.

#### Other Examples:
- Similar verification can be done for other examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
