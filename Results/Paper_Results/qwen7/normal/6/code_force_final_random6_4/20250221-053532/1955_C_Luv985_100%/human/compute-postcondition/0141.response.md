Output State: **`k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`; `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`; `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

In this step, the value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `k`, `mi`, `a[l]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
