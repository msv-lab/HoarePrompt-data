Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an input integer**.

The code simply reassigns the variable `day` to 'AM', which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
