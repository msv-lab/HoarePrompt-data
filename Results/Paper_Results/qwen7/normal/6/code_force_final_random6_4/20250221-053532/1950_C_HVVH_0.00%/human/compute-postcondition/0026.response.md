Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers separated by a colon from the input and assigns them to `h` and `m` respectively. The values of `t`, `day`, `n`, and the original `h` (if it was 0) are not affected by this operation. The condition for setting `h` to 12 and changing `day` to 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h` is outside the given code snippet. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged, and only `h` and `m` are updated with the input values.
