### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case.
2. **Time Conversion Logic**:
   - For `h == 0`, it correctly converts this to `12 AM`.
   - For `h > 12`, it correctly subtracts 12 to convert to the 12-hour format and sets `day` to `PM`.
   - However, there's an issue with the logic when `h` is between 1 and 11. It incorrectly sets `day` to `PM` regardless of whether `h` is 12 or not.
   - Specifically, the line `if h == 12: day = 'AM'` should be removed or handled more carefully.
3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the time in the correct format with leading zeros and the appropriate AM/PM indicator.

### Corrected Logic:
- When `h` is 12, it should remain `12` and set `day` to `PM`.
- For `h` between 1 and 11, it should set `day` to `AM`.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in handling the case where `h` is 12. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
