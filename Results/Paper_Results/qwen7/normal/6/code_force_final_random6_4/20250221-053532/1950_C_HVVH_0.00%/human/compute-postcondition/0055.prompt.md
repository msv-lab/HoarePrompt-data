Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
    if h == 0:
        h = 12
        day = 'AM'
    elif h > 12:
        h = h - 12
        day = 'PM'
    else:
        day = 'PM'
        if h == 12:
            day = 'AM'
    print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is either 12 or an input integer (not equal to 0), and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12, `day` becomes 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` becomes 'PM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by ':'. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, the value of `day` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12 or less, `day` remains 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it is adjusted to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
