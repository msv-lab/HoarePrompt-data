Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The logic to convert the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format is flawed:
   - When `h` is 0, it should be converted to 12 and the day should be 'AM'.
   - When `h` is greater than 12, it should be reduced by 12 and the day should be 'PM'.
   - When `h` is 12, it should remain 12 and the day should be 'PM'.
   - For all other values of `h`, the day should be 'AM'.
4. The current implementation incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12, and it does not handle the case when `h` is 0 properly.
5. The final print statement formats the hours and minutes correctly but uses the wrong logic for determining the AM/PM period.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format.

Correctness: **False**
