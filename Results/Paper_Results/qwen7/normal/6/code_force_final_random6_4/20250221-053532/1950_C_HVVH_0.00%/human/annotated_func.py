#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input after each iteration. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is 12 or less, `day` remains 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it is adjusted to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of times in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to a 12-hour clock format, printing the converted time along with 'AM' or 'PM'. It iterates `n` times, where `n` is provided as input, and adjusts the hour values accordingly. After processing, it prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM" for each input time.
