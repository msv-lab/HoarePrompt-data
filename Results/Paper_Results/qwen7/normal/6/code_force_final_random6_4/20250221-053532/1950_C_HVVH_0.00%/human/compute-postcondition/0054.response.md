Based on the initial state and the provided conditions:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input.
- If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'.
- Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12` and `day` is set to 'PM'.
- If `h` is 12 or less, `day` remains 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it is adjusted to 0.

The `print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)` statement will print the time in 12-hour format followed by the AM/PM indicator.

Given these conditions, the values of `h` and `m` will be formatted to two digits (e.g., `05` instead of `5`), and `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the value of `h`.

Therefore, the output will be in the format of `hh:mm AM/PM`.

Output: **{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}**
