Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It returns information based on the time represented by `s` and the integer `t`.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include the actual logic for processing `t` and `s`, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and their expected formats.
