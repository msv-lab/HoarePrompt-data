Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` and `m` are updated to integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code simply changes the value of `day` from 'PM' to 'AM'. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `h`, or `m`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged except for `day`, which is now 'AM'.
