Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is `0`.
2. The variable `a` is a list, but no specific elements of `a` are provided. We only know that `len(a)` must be at least `1`, meaning `a` contains at least one element.
3. The print statement accesses `a[i]`, where `i` is `0`. Therefore, it will print the first element of the list `a`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **[first element of list a]**
