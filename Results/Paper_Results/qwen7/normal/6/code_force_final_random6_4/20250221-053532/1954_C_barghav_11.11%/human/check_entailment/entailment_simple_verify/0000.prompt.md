You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` is a non-empty string, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from `x`, and `b` is a list of characters. For each index `i` in `a` and `b` up to the length of `a`, if `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, `b[i]` will be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` will be the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus one, `b[i]` will be the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` will be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `a` and `b` are modified according to the described rules, and the loop has executed for as many times as there are elements in `a`.
    #
    #To explain this in natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. This means the loop has run once for each element in `a`. The lists `a` and `b` have been modified such that for each index `i` up to the length of `a`:
    #- If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, `b[i]` is set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is set to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
    #- If `i` is greater than half the length of `a` minus one, `b[i]` is set to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
    #
    #The loop body only prints the current value of `a[i]` without affecting the values of `a` and `b` directly during the print operation. Therefore, the final states of `a` and `b` reflect the transformations applied during each iteration based on the conditions provided.
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `i` is 4, `b` is a list with the same length as `a`, where for the first half of the list (up to the midpoint), `b[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and the original `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and the original `b[i]`. For the second half of the list, `b[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and the original `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and the original `b[i]`.
    print()
    #This is printed: None



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. Specifically, the swapping logic in `func_1()` does not ensure that the largest digits are swapped between corresponding positions in `x` and `y` to maximize their product. Instead, it simply swaps the minimum and maximum digits within each position without considering the overall impact on the product.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
19
91
```
The program outputs:
```
91
19
```
However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits such that both numbers are as large as possible. In this case, swapping the digits results in `99` and `11`, which does not maximize the product. The correct approach would be to ensure that the highest digits are aligned in the most significant positions.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the digits of `x` and `y` in descending order and then pairing the largest digits from each number together. This ensures that the product is maximized.
