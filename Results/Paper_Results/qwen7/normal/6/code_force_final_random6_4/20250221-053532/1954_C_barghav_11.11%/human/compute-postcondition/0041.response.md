Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to `1`.
2. It also states that `len(a)` must be at least `2`, meaning the list `a` has at least two elements.
3. The `print` statement accesses `a[i]`, which translates to `a[1]` since `i` is `1`.

Given these conditions, `a[1]` refers to the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1]**
