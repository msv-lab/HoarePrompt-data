Output State: **The loop will continue to iterate as long as \(i\) (which starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than or equal to the square root of \(x\). Once \(i\) exceeds the square root of \(x\), the loop will terminate.**

After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions will hold:
- `x` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
- `i` will be the largest integer such that \(i \leq \sqrt{x}\).
- `output1` will contain all integers \(i\) such that \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{x}\) and \(x\) is divisible by \(i\).
- `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors of \(x\) for each divisor listed in `output1`.

In natural language, the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations would be:
- `x` remains within the specified range.
- `i` is set to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `output2` contains the corresponding quotient for each divisor in `output1`.
