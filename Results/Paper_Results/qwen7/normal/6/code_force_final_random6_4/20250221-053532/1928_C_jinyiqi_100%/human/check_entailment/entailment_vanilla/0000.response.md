Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
     - If `(n + x - 2)` is even, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)`.
     - If `(n - x)` is even, it calls `func_1(n - x)`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of `x`, including both the smaller and larger divisors.
   - The function iterates through numbers from `1` to `sqrt(x)` and collects divisors in `output1` and their corresponding pairs in `output2`.
   - It reverses `output1` and appends it to `output2`, ensuring all divisors are included.

4. **Processing Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if `(s + 2)` is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.

5. **Removing Duplicates and Counting:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The length of the set is printed, which gives the number of valid `k`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even correctly.
   - It ensures that only valid `k` values (where `k > 1`) are considered.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of `x`.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `k` is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the calculated `k` fits the given position `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to be correct based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
