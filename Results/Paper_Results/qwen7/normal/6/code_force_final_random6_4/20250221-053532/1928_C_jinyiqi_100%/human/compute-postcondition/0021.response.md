Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer. It returns the sum of `output2` and `output1`, where `output1` is the result of reversing a string or list that was iterated over until `i` (an index) exceeded the square root of `x`, and `output2` is undefined in the given information.**
