Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `output1` is a list containing `[1, 3]`, `output2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
- `output1` originally contains `[1]` and then appends `i`, which is 3, making `output1` now `[1, 3]`.
- The condition for `output2` to contain `[int(x / 2)]` if `x % 3 == 0` is not met since the value of `x` is not specified to be divisible by 3, so `output2` remains an empty list.
