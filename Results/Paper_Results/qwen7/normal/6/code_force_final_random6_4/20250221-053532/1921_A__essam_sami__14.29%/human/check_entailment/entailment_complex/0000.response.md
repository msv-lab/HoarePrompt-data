Reasoning:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the side length of the square. The program calculates the squared distance between the first and fourth corners, and the second and third corners, but it does not ensure that these distances correspond to the side lengths of the square. Instead, the diagonal distances are being considered, which would only be correct if the points were already assumed to form a square, but they are not. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the absolute difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the corners. Specifically, we should calculate the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of all possible pairs of points and identify the minimum non-zero difference, which represents the side length of the square.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square.

Correctness: **False**
