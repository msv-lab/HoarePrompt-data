You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t such sets of coordinates, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` will be equal to `t-1` after all iterations, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will each hold the last set of integers entered for their respective roles in the loop. The variable `n` will be equal to \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\) and `x` will be equal to \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\). If at any point during the loop, `x` is greater than `n`, `x` will retain its original value from that iteration; otherwise, it will be updated to `n`. After all iterations, the maximum value between `n` and `x` from the last iteration will be printed.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the final output will be the maximum value between `n` and `x` calculated in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes t sets of coordinates, where each set contains four integers (x_i, y_i) representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns nothing explicitly but processes each set to validate if the given coordinates form a valid square.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
