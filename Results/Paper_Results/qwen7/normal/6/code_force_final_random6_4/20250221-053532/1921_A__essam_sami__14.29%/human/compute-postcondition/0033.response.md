Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is an integer from the input split, `d` is an integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is the first integer from the current input split, `h` is the second integer from the current input split, `x` is \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\), `n` is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\). If \(x > n\), then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
