Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, steps is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split.**

The code `e, f = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `e` and `f`. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.
