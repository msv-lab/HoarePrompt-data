Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `d` is the second integer from the input split, `e` is the first integer from the next input split, `f` is the second integer from the next input split, `g` is an integer from the input split, `h` is an integer from the input split, `n` is (a - e)Â² + (b - f)Â²**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
