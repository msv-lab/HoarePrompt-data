Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 1 (though `steps` is not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers (their values are unknown but they are integers).
- `c` and `d` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively.
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the next input split respectively.
- `g` and `h` are integers from the input split (their values are unknown but they are integers).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\).

The print statement is `print(n)`, which will print the value of `n`.

Given the formula for `n`, it is \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\), where `a` and `b` are input integers, and `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the next input split respectively.

Output: **(a - e)² + (b - f)²**
