Output: **(c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 (where c and d are integers from the input split, and g and h are the first and second integers from the current input split respectively)**

Explanation:
- `x` is defined as \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).
- `c` and `d` are integers from the input split.
- `g` is the first integer from the current input split.
- `h` is the second integer from the current input split.
- Therefore, when the `print(x)` statement is executed, it will print the value of \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).
