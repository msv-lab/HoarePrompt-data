Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes t sets of coordinates, where each set contains four integers (x_i, y_i) representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns nothing explicitly but processes each set to validate if the given coordinates form a valid square.**

Note: Since the output is not specified in the problem statement, the function's primary action is described as processing the input without returning any explicit value.
