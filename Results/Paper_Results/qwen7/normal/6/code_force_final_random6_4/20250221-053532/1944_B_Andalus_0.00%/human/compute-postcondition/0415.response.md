Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

However, the initial state does not provide any explicit value or definition for the variable `elem`. Since `elem` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, the output will include the placeholder `elem` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function.

Output: **elem elem**
