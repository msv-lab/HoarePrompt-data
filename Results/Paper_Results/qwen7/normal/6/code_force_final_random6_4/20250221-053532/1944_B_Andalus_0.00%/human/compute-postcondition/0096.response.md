Output State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`, `sz` is `sz_prev + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of `sng`, `sz`, `sz_prev`, `k`, or `n`. It only indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
