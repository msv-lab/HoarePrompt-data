Output State: **`sz` is 2, `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, `elem` is the last element of `sng`, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it 2. The values of `sng`, `elem`, and `rdb` remain unchanged, and the condition that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2 now translates to `k - 2` being greater than or equal to 2.
