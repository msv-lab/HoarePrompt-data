Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1, `rdb` is an empty iterable, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is now ['']**.

Explanation: The code initializes `rdb` as an empty list, which is explicitly stated as `rdb = []`. This does not change the values of `sng`, `elem`, `sz`, or `ldb`, but it updates `rdb` to be an empty list.
