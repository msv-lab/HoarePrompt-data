Output State: **`sz` is exactly `k` minus 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k` and is now exactly `k` minus 2, the `break` statement does not change the value of `sz`. It only indicates that we are breaking out of the loop or conditional block we are currently inside.
