Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1, and `rdb` is an empty iterable, `n` is an integer obtained from input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer obtained from input split by space and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers separated by a space from the input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The other variables (`sng`, `elem`, `sz`, and `rdb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
