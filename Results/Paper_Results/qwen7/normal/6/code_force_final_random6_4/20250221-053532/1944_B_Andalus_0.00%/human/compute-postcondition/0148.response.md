Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in this loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rdb` must not be empty.
   - `sz` is equal to `k` + 2.
   - `sng` must not be empty.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is based on `sng`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `sng`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `sng` must still contain at least one element (since it must not be empty).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `rdb` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sz` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `sng` must still be non-empty for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + 2, `sng` must not be empty**.
