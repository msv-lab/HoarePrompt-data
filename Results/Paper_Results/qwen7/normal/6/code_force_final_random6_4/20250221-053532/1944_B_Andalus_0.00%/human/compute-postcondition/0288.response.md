Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `sng`, `sz`, or `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of `sng`, `sz`, and `k` remain unchanged.
