Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 before the loop starts.

4. **Determine the Range of `i`:**
   - The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes at least once.

5. **Check Other Provided Variables:**
   - `ldb` and `sng` are lists derived from `lft` based on certain conditions, but they are not directly involved in the loop head. Thus, their initial states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

6. **Combine the Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
