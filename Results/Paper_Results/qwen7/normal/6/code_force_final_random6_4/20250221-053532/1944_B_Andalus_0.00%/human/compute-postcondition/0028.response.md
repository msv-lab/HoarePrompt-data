Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The range of the loop is from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` includes values from 1 up to but not including `n`). 

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For `i = 2`, the next value will be `i = 3`.
   - For `i = 3`, the next value will be `i = 4`.

5. **Adjust the States Based on the Next Value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 2, then `i` will become 3.
   - If `i` was 3, then `i` will become 4.

6. **Update the Other Variables**:
   - `ldb` will be updated to `lft[i]` for both cases.
   - `lft[i]` should not be equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]` if `i` is 3.
   - `sng` will contain the elements `lft[3]` and `lft[i]` if `i` becomes 3.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- If `i` was 2, then `i` becomes 3.
- If `i` was 3, then `i` becomes 4.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be 3 if it was 2, or 4 if it was 3.
- `ldb` will be `lft[i]` for both cases.
- `lft[i]` should not be equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]` if `i` is 4.
- `sng` will contain the elements `lft[3]` and `lft[i]` if `i` is 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 3 or 4, `ldb` is equal to `lft[i]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]` if `i` is 4, and `sng` contains the elements `lft[3]` and `lft[i]` if `i` is 4.**
