Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `rgt[i]` (which is `rgt[1]`) is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`.
   - `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be updated to 2.
   - The condition for `n` remains the same: `n` must be at least 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The values of `rgt[1]` and `rdb` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, the value of `rgt[1]` is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`**.
