Based on the initial state provided, the variables `sz` and `rdb` have certain conditions but their exact values are not specified. The `print` statement simply outputs `elem` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not given, we cannot determine its precise value. However, we know that `elem` is a variable that exists in the context where this print statement is being executed.

Output: **elem elem**
