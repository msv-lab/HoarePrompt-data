Based on the initial state provided:

- `rdb` is not empty.
- `sz` is equal to `k` + 2.
- `sng` is not empty.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined or given any specific value in the initial state, we cannot determine its value from the provided information.

Given the print statement `print(elem, end=' ')`, it will print the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since we do not have the value of `elem`, we can only describe it as the value of `elem`.

Output: **elem**
