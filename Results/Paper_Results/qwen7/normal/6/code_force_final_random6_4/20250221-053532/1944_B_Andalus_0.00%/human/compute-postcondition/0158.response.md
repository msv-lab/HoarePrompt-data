Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by converting the input (which is a space-separated string of integers) into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial conditions for `rdb` and `sz` remain unchanged, and `n` and `k` are updated to the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The new list `lst` is created based on the input.
