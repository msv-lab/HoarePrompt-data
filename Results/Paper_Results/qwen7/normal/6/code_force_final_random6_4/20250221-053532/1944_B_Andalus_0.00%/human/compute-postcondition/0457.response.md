Output State: All elements in `sng` have been processed, `sz` is equal to the total number of elements in `sng`, and `rdb` remains empty.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Since `sz` increments by 1 with each iteration and the loop breaks when `sz` is no longer less than `k`, the loop will continue until all elements in `sng` have been processed. Given that the initial state ensures `sz` starts at a value where it can be incremented to match the size of `sng`, and considering the loop breaks when `sz` reaches `k` or more, all elements in `sng` will be printed exactly once, making `sz` equal to the total number of elements in `sng`. The variable `rdb` is not affected by the loop, so it remains empty.
