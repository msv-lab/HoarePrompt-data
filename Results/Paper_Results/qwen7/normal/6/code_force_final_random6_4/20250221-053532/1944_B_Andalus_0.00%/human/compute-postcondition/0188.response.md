Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`; `sng` is a list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list with the element `lft[i]` appended to it. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.
