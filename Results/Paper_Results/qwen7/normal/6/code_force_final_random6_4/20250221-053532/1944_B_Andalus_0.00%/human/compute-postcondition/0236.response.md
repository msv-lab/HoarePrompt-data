Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head objects**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `elem`**: Since the loop starts with `elem` being the first element of `sng`, `elem` must be initialized to the first element of `sng` before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the initial state of `sng`**: The variable `sng` is the iterable over which the loop iterates. For the loop to execute, `sng` must contain at least one element.

4. **Consider the given state**: The state before the loop starts is that `sz` is a value between 2 and 2 * len(ldb), inclusive, depending on the value of `k`. However, since `ldb` is an empty list (`len(ldb) == 0`), `sz` is effectively a value between 2 and 0, which means `sz` must be 2 (the minimum possible value).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Given that `ldb` is an empty list, the value of `sz` does not affect the execution of the loop directly. The key is ensuring that `sng` has at least one element.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `sng` must have at least one element.
- `elem` must be initialized to the first element of `sng`.

State: **`sz` is 2, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the first element of `sng`**
