Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` from the iterable `rdb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `rdb`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than it had before the current iteration started.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `rdb` is an iterable, and it had one less element at the end of the previous iteration, it will now have one less element again (if it was not empty).
   - The variable `elem` will take the value of the next element in `rdb`.

5. **Check the loop exit condition**: The loop will break if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't need to consider this condition yet.

Given the above reasoning, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `elem`, which will take the value of the next element in `rdb`.

**State:**
- `sz` remains 2.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than it had before the current iteration started.
- `elem` will be the next element in `rdb`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, `elem` will be the next element in `rdb`**.
