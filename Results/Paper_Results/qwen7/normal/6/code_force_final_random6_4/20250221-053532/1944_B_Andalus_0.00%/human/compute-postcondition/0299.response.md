Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
   - `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is the next element in `sng`, after processing `elem`, `sng` will now be an iterable without the first element.
   - `sz` is incremented by 1, so it needs to be updated to reflect this change.
   - `elem` will be the next element in the updated `sng`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `sng` will now be the iterable without the first element.
   - `elem` will be the next element in the updated `sng`.
   - `sz` will be the original value of `sz` plus 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable (excluding the first element), `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1**
