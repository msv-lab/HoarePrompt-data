Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` can be any positive integer, `rgt[0]` to `rgt[n-1]` will determine the contents of `rdb`, which will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. The other variables (`ldb`, `sng`, `lft`, and `rgt`) will retain their initial states as described in the problem statement. Specifically, `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, and `sng` will contain all unique elements from `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, provided they are not followed by the same element or are the last element in `lft`. `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from index 0 up to `n-2`. `lft` will contain the original elements from the input, and `rgt` will be empty.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `rdb` will hold all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, starting from the first element up to the second last element. The rest of the variables will stay in their initial states as per the given conditions.
