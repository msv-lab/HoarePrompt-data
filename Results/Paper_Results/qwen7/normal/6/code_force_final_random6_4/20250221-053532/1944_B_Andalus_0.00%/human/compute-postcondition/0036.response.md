Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `ldb` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `sng` is a list containing all elements in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1` that are not part of any consecutive duplicates.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. During each iteration, if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i-1]`, the element is added to `ldb`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to both `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]`, the element is added to `sng`. By the end of the loop, `ldb` will contain all elements that are part of consecutive duplicates (excluding the first occurrence of each group), and `sng` will contain all other elements that are not part of any consecutive duplicates.
