Output State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`. `sz` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1. The sequence `sng` and the conditions involving `k` and `n` remain unchanged since the code does not modify them. The if condition that checks `if sz >= k` is not explicitly mentioned to be executed here, but the postcondition ensures that `sz` is within the range `[k, n-1]` before the increment, and after the increment, `sz` will be in the range `[k+1, n]` if it was initially in `[k, n-1]`. However, the postcondition ensures that if `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `sz` is increased by 1.
