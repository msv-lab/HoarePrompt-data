Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `sng` will contain all unique elements from the list `lft` starting from index 1, `ldb` will contain all duplicate elements found in `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, and `rgt`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `n`, `lst`, and `lft` will retain their final states as they were after the last iteration of the loop.**

To explain this in natural language:
- `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and after the loop completes, `i` will be `n`.
- `sng` will be a list of all unique elements from `lft` starting from the second element (`lft[1]`) to the last element (`lft[n-1]`). This means `sng` will contain each element from `lft[1]` to `lft[n-1]` exactly once.
- `ldb` will be a list of all duplicate elements found in `lft` starting from the second element (`lft[1]`) to the second last element (`lft[n-2]`). If an element appears more than once in this range, it will be included in `ldb`.
- The other variables (`rgt`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `n`, `lst`, and `lft`) will remain in their state after the last iteration of the loop, which is consistent with the final values they had after the third iteration as described in the given output states.
