Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` and `sz` is increased by 2.**

Given the initial state where `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, and the condition that if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2; otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged, the code `sz += 2` directly increases `sz` by 2. This action satisfies the condition since `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k`, and now it is further increased by 2. Therefore, the updated state is that `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` and has been increased by 2.
