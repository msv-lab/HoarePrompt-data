Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is a list with at least one element. The variable `elem` is used in the `print` statement, but it is not explicitly defined in the given information. Since `elem` is not further defined or assigned a value within the scope of the provided code snippet, we can assume that `elem` refers to the first element of the list `sng`.

Given this, the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `sng`.

Output: **the first element of sng**
