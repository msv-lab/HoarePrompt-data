Postcondition: `sz` is either 2 or 4 depending on whether `k - sz >= 2`. If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is set to 4, `ldb` is a non-empty list with one fewer element, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz < 2`, `sz` remains unchanged, and `ldb` is still a non-empty list with one fewer element, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
