Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
- The value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, let's assume it has at least one element. For simplicity, let's denote the first element of `rdb` as `elem`.

Given that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, and `sz` is 0, `k` must be at least 2. This means that even if the code breaks out of the loop or if statement, `k` will still be at least 2, ensuring that `elem` is valid and can be accessed.

Therefore, the print statement will print the first element of `rdb` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
