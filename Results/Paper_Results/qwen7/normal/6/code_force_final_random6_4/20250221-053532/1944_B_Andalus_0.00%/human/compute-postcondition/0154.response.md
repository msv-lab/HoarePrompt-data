Output State: `rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + n, where `n` is the total number of elements in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` plus the total number of elements in the `sng` list. Additionally, the loop will have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that either `sz` reached `k` or `sng` became empty before completing all iterations.
