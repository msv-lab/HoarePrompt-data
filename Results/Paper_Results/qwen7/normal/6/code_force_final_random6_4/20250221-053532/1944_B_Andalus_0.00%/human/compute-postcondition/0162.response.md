Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `rdb = []` initializes `rdb` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `ldb`, `sz`, `k`, `n`, `lst`, `lft`, or `rgt`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
