Output State: **`sz` is either 2 or 0, `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `sng`, `elem`, `rdb`, or the condition `k - sz`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
