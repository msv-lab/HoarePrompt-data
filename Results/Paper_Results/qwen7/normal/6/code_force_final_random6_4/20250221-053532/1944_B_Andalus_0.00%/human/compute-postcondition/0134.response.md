Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state before the loop starts is given as "The loop continues until `sz` reaches `k`, or there are no more elements in `rdb`."

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues until `sz` reaches `k`, or `rdb` is empty.
   - This means that the loop will execute as long as `rdb` is not empty and `sz` has not reached `k`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `rdb` not being empty and `sz` not reaching `k`, these are the conditions that need to be ensured for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `elem` is used within the loop but its initial state is not relevant to the loop condition.

5. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - We need to ensure that `rdb` is not empty and `sz` has not reached `k` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` must not have reached `k`**.
