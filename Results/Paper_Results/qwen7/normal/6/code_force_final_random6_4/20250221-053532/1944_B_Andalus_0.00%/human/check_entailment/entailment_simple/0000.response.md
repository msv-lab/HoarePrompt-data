Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Splitting**: The program splits the list `lst` into `lft` and `rgt`, which correspond to the first `n` and last `n` elements of the original list, respectively.
3. **Duplicate Elements Identification**:
   - The program identifies duplicate elements in `lft` and stores them in `ldb`.
   - It also identifies unique elements in `lft` and stores them in `sng`.
4. **Subset Construction**:
   - The program constructs the subset `l` using elements from `ldb` and `sng`.
   - It ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` matches the XOR of elements in `r` constructed similarly from `rdb` and `sng`.

However, there are some issues with the logic and implementation:

- **Handling Duplicates in `rdb`**: The program does not handle duplicates in `rdb`. Since the problem guarantees that every integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, duplicates should be handled similarly to how they are handled in `ldb`.
- **Ensuring XOR Match**: The program does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` matches the XOR of elements in `r`. Instead, it just prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` without ensuring the XOR condition is met.
- **Incorrect Subset Construction**: The program does not properly construct the subsets `l` and `r` to ensure their XOR values match. It simply prints elements from `ldb` and `sng` without considering the XOR condition.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
