Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, `rdb` must still contain at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz` and `k`, nor does it modify the contents of the list `rdb`. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no other changes are made to the variables, the initial conditions remain valid.
