Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `sng` will contain all unique elements from the list `lft` starting from index 1, `ldb` will contain all duplicate elements found in `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, and `rgt`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `n`, `lst`, and `lft` will retain their final states as they were after the last iteration of the loop.

In more detail:
- `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
- `sng` will be a list of all unique elements from `lft` starting from the second element (`lft[1]`) to the last element (`lft[n-1]`).
- `ldb` will be a list of all duplicate elements found in `lft` starting from the second element (`lft[1]`) to the second last element (`lft[n-2]`).
- The other variables (`rgt`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `n`, `lst`, and `lft`) will remain in their state after the last iteration of the loop, which is consistent with the final values they had after the third iteration as described in the given output states.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is known but its exact value is not specified, `sng` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `rgt` retains its state after the last iteration with the current value of `rgt[1]` being equal to `rgt[0]`, `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`, `rdb` retains its state after the last iteration, `sz` retains its state after the last iteration, `k` retains its state after the last iteration, `lst` retains its state after the last iteration, `lft` retains its state after the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is now 2, `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` (which is `rgt[2]`) appended to it, and this is the final state regardless of whether `rgt[i]` equals `rgt[i - 1]` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `rdb` contains the element `rgt[3]` appended to it, and if `rgt[3]` is equal to `rgt[2]`, `rdb` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
