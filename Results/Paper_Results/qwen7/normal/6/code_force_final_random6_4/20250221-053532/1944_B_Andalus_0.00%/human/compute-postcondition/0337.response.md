Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `sng` has appended `lft[3]`**

Explanation: The code `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `sng` will append `lft[3]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
