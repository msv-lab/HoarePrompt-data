Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables used in the `for` loop. Here, the loop iterates over each element in `rdb` using the variable `elem`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `rdb`. This means the loop will continue until `rdb` is exhausted.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sz` is 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
   - The value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `rdb`, the variable `elem` will be updated to the next element in `rdb`.
   - The variable `sz` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, it is not modified inside the loop.
   - The variable `rdb` will be updated to the remaining elements in the iterable after the current element is processed.
   - The condition `k - sz` must still hold true for the loop to continue, meaning `k - sz` should still be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sz` remains 2.
   - `rdb` is now an iterable with at least one element (since it was non-empty and one element was processed).
   - `k - sz` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `sz` is 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.**
