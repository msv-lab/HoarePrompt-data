Output State: **`sz` is 5, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the third element of `sng`.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The values of `sng` and `elem` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement based on `sz` being greater than or equal to `k` is not specified with a particular value for `k`, so it remains as a general condition.
