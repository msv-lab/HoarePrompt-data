Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `elem` which iterates over the list `ldb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `ldb`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is 2.
   - `ldb` is a non-empty list.
   - Either `(k - sz)` is greater than or equal to 0, or there is no else part implying `(k - sz) < 2`.

4. **Analyze what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, the loop processes one element from `ldb`.
   - After processing an element, the length of `ldb` decreases by 1.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ldb` is a non-empty list, it must have at least one element left for the loop to continue.
   - After processing one element, `ldb` will have one less element.
   - Therefore, `ldb` must now be a non-empty list with one less element.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sz` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ldb` must now be a non-empty list with one less element.
   - The condition `(k - sz)` still needs to be considered. Since `sz` is 2, `(k - 2)` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to continue, or if there is no else part, `(k - 2) < 2`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `sz` is 2, `ldb` is a non-empty list with one less element, and either `(k - 2)` is greater than or equal to 0, or there is no else part (implying `(k - 2) < 2`).**
