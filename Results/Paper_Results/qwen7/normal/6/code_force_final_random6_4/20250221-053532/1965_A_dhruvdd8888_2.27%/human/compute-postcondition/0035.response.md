Postcondition: **`cd` is the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` that differ by exactly 1, and `i` is the index just beyond the last pair of consecutive elements that differ by exactly 1, or `len(nums) - 2` if such pairs exist throughout the list. The final value of `cd` is odd. `nums` remains unchanged from the initial state.**
