Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1` holds true for consecutive elements in the list `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, the variable `cd` will hold the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` that differ by exactly 1.

If there are no such pairs throughout the entire list, `cd` will remain 0. If there are one or more pairs of consecutive elements that differ by exactly 1, `cd` will be incremented for each such pair until the condition is no longer met, at which point the loop will break.

The final value of `i` will be the index just beyond the last pair of consecutive elements that differ by exactly 1, or it will be equal to `len(nums) - 2` if such pairs exist throughout the list.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be:
- `cd`: The count of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` that differ by exactly 1.
- `i`: The index just beyond the last pair of consecutive elements that differ by exactly 1, or `len(nums) - 2` if such pairs exist throughout the list.
- `nums`: Unchanged from the initial state.
- `cd`: Updated based on the conditions within the loop.
