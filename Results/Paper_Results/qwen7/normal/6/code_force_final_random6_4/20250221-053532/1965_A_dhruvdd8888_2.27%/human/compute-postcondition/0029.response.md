Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 3, `cd` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `cd` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial value (which was 1 since `i` was 2) to 1. The variable `i` is not directly affected by this line of code, but since `i` was 2 initially, it would now be 3 after an operation that typically increments it (though the exact operation is not specified here). The list `nums` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it.
