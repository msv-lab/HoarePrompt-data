Output State: **`cd` is 1, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 0 or 1, and the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cd` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number), making its new value 1. All other variables (`nums`, `i`) remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
