Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3, and the first element is 0; `cd` is 0.**

The code `cd = 0` initializes the variable `cd` to 0. Since `nums` was already defined as a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and its first element being 0, this definition remains unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is that `cd` is now set to 0.
