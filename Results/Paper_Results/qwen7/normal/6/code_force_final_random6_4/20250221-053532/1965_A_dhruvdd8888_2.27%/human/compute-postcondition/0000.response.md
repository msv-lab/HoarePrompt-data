Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5; the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_N` represents the initial number of stones in each of the N piles, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each pile.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `N`. This integer `N` represents the number of test cases. The initial values of `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `N` and retains the initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_N`.
