Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with a length greater than 3 and the first element is 0, `i` is 1 or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `nums` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition about the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` also remains the same.
