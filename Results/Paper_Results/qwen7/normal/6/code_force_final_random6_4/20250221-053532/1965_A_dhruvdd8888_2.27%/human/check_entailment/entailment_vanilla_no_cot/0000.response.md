Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` without processing any test case data. It should process each test case individually within a loop.

2. **Incorrect Parsing of Pile Sizes**: The program reads the number of piles and then attempts to read the pile sizes as a space-separated string into a set, which is not necessary and can cause issues. It should directly read the list of pile sizes as integers.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Game Determination**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program checks only the first two elements of the sorted list of pile sizes and does not correctly implement the game logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Sort the piles
    nums.sort()
    
    # If there is only one pile, Alice wins immediately
    if N == 1:
        print('Alice')
        continue
    
    # Find the minimum pile size
    min_pile = nums[0]
    
    # Determine the number of moves required to make all piles empty
    moves = 0
    for pile in nums:
        moves += pile // min_pile
    
    # If the total number of moves is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins
    if moves % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

```

This corrected version properly processes each test case, sorts the pile sizes, and determines the winner based on the total number of moves required to empty all piles.
