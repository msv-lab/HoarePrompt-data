Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the strings in the original set.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` takes the set `nums` containing strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, nums)`, and then sorts these integers in ascending order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `nums`, the only thing we can definitively say is that `nums` is now a sorted list of integers derived from the original set. The other variables (`t`, `N`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_N`) remain unchanged.
