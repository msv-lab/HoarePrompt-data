Output State: **`q` is `x_new`, the value of `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n`, and if `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains `(q + r) % n`, `ans` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained `(x + r) % n` and `(x - r) % n`, after adding `(q + r) % n`, `temp` now includes these three elements. The conditions regarding the value of `c` and the contents of `ans` remain unchanged.
