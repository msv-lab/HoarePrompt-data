Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` contains all possible players who could have the ball, including `n`.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` is updated to include `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*sorted(ans))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `ans` initially contains all possible players who could have the ball, including `n`.
- If `0` is already in `ans`, then adding `n` to `ans` would result in `ans` being `[0, n]` (or possibly `[n, 0]` if `n` was added after `0`).
- If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged and still includes `n`.

The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement sorts `ans` and then prints its elements separated by spaces.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1**: `0` is in `ans` initially.
  - `ans` becomes `[0, n]` (or `[n, 0]`).
  - After sorting, `ans` is `[0, n]`.
  - The output will be `0 n`.

- **Case 2**: `0` is not in `ans` initially.
  - `ans` remains `[n]`.
  - After sorting, `ans` is still `[n]`.
  - The output will be `n`.

Given the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities. However, since the initial state does not specify whether `0` is in `ans` or not, we must account for both scenarios.

### Conclusion:
- If `0` is in `ans`, the output will be `0 n`.
- If `0` is not in `ans`, the output will be `n`.

Since the exact state of `ans` is not explicitly stated, we need to present both possible outcomes.

Output: **0 n** or **n**
