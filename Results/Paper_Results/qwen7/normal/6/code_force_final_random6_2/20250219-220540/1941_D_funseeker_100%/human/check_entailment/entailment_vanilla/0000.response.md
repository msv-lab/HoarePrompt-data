Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**: The program correctly reads the input and processes it according to the problem statement. It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`. It then processes each throw, updating the set of possible players who could have the ball.

2. **Processing Each Throw**: 
   - The program correctly handles both clockwise (`0`) and counterclockwise (`1`) throws, as well as unknown directions (`?`).
   - For each throw, it calculates the new possible positions for the ball using modulo arithmetic to handle circular movement.
   - If the direction is unknown (`?`), it considers both clockwise and counterclockwise movements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the ball might wrap around the circle (e.g., when adding or subtracting the distance results in `0` or `n`).
   - It ensures that `0` is replaced with `n` if present in the set of possible players.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players and their sorted indices, which matches the required output format.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - The provided example and the structure of the program suggest that it should work for all given constraints and examples.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
