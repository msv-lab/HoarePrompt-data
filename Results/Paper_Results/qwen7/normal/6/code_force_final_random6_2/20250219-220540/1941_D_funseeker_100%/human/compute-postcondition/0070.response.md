Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `temp` contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already contained the value `(q + r) % n`, now it contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it was mentioned that its values would remain unchanged if `c` is '1' or '?'. The value of `c` also remains unchanged as per the precondition.
