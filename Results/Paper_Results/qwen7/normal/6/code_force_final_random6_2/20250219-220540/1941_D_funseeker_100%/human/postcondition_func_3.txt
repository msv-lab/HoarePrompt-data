The function accepts the number of players \( n \), the number of throws \( m \), the initial player \( x \), and a set \( ans \) initialized with player \( x \). For each throw, it updates the set \( ans \) based on the throw's distance \( r \) and direction \( c \). After all throws, it ensures that the set \( ans \) includes all players, and if player 0 is present, it replaces it with player \( n \). Finally, it prints the size of the set \( ans \) and the sorted list of players in \( ans \).
