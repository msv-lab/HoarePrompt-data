Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element less than before, `temp` now contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` where `q` is the first element of the updated `ans`, and `c` remains either '0' or '?'. `temp` has added the value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Here, `q` is the first element of the updated `ans`, and `r` is another element from `ans`. The operation `(q - r) % n` is performed and the result is added to `temp`. The value of `c` remains unchanged and is either '0' or '?'. The length of `ans` is reduced by at least one element, and `temp` now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
