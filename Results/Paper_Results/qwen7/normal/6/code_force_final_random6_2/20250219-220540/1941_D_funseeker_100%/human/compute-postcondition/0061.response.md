Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `r` is the integer value of the first split element from the result of `func_1()`.split(), `c` is the second split element from the result of `func_1()`.split().**

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. The value of `m` is decremented by 1. The values of `r` and `c` are derived from the split result of `func_1()`, but their types remain unchanged. The initial conditions about all players having the ball at least once are not affected by the code.
