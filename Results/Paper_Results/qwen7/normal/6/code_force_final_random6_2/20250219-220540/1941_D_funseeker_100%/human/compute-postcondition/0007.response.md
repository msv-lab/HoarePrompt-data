Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is an empty set, `ans` must not be empty (it already contains `x`). The current value of `c` is either '0' or '?'.**
