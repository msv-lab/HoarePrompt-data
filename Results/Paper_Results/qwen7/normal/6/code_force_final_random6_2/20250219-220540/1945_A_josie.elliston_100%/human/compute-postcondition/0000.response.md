Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.

Explanation: The code `ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)` calls the function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and assigns the return value of this function call to the variable `ret`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `ret`. However, we know that `ret` is the result of the function call, and the values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged from their initial state.
