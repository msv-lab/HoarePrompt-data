Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when calculating the minimum number of tents required for the given constraints. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. However, it does not correctly handle cases where the number of extroverts is less than 3 but more than 0, and there are no universals available to fill the remaining spots.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses the result from `func_1` to calculate the total number of tents needed. However, it does not account for the fact that introverts need individual tents, and it does not handle the case where the number of extroverts is less than 3 and there are no universals to fill the remaining spots.

### Example Cases Where the Program Fails:
- **Case: 1 4 1**
  - According to the problem, 1 extrovert cannot be placed in a tent with 2 universals since there is only 1 universal available. Hence, the answer should be `-1`.
  - However, the current implementation will incorrectly return `3`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of tents required for extroverts and universals using `func_1`.
2. Ensure that the number of extroverts is always paired with at least 2 others (either universals or introverts).
3. Handle the case where the number of extroverts is less than 3 and there are no universals to pair with.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of full tents needed for extroverts and universals
    full_tents = extroverts // 3
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts % 3
    remaining_universals = universals - (extroverts // 3) * 2

    # If there are remaining extroverts and no universals, return -1
    if remaining_extroverts > 0 and remaining_universals < remaining_extroverts:
        return -1

    # Calculate the number of additional tents needed
    additional_tents = ceil((remaining_extroverts + remaining_universals) / 3)
    return full_tents + additional_tents

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret == -1 else introverts + ret

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().strip().split())
        print(func_2(a, b, c))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all edge cases correctly and returns the right number of tents or `-1` when necessary.
