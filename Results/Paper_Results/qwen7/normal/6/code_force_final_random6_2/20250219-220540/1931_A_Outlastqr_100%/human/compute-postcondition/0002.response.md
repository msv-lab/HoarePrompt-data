Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is assigned the value of the integer entered by the user.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer entered by the user to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
