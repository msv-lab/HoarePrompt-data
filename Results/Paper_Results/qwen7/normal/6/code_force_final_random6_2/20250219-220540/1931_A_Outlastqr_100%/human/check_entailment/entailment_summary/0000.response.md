Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program against the problem statement and the given examples.

1. **Encoding Logic**: 
   - The program correctly identifies the range of values for \( n \) and maps them to the appropriate characters.
   - For \( n > 52 \), it should generate a word like "aaa" followed by "zz", but the current logic just adds "zz".
   - For \( n > 27 \) and \( n \leq 52 \), it should generate a word like "aa" followed by the corresponding character, but the current logic adds the 29th character of the alphabet instead.
   - For \( n = 27 \), it correctly sets the word to "aay".
   - For \( n \leq 26 \), it should generate a word like "aa" followed by the corresponding character, but the current logic adds the \( n \)-th character of the alphabet instead.

2. **Examples Analysis**:
   - For \( n = 24 \):
     - Expected: "aaa" + "zz" (since 24 - 53 = -29, which is not in the range, so it should be "aaa" + "zz")
     - Actual: "ava" (which is incorrect)
   - For \( n = 70 \):
     - Expected: "aaa" + "zz" (since 70 - 53 = 17, which is in the range, so it should be "aaa" + "zz")
     - Actual: "rzz" (which is correct)
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - Expected: "aaa" + "a" (since 3 - 3 = 0, which is in the range, so it should be "aa" + "a")
     - Actual: "aaa" (which is incorrect)
   - For \( n = 55 \):
     - Expected: "aaa" + "zz" (since 55 - 53 = 2, which is in the range, so it should be "aaa" + "zz")
     - Actual: "czz" (which is correct)
   - For \( n = 48 \):
     - Expected: "aaa" + "zz" (since 48 - 53 = -5, which is not in the range, so it should be "aaa" + "zz")
     - Actual: "auz" (which is incorrect)

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the lexicographically smallest word for all ranges of \( n \).

Correctness: **False**
