Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is a string based on the value of `n`, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The value of `t`, `word`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `n` as "an input integer" is updated to reflect that `n` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
