Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly generates the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - For `n > 52`: The program constructs a word by appending "zz" to the character at index `n - 53`. This is correct because the highest possible sum of three characters (each being 'z') is 78, and any `n` greater than 52 can only be formed by 'z', 'z', and the remaining character.
   - For `28 <= n <= 52`: The program constructs a word by appending the character at index `n - 28` followed by 'z'. This is correct because these sums can only be formed by 'a', the character at index `n - 28`, and 'z'.
   - For `n == 27`: The program sets the word to "aay". This is correct because the sum 27 can only be formed by 'a', 'a', and 'y'.
   - For `3 <= n <= 26`: The program constructs a word by appending "aa" followed by the character at index `n - 3`. This is correct because these sums can only be formed by 'a', 'a', and the character at index `n - 3`.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the generated word for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program logic matches the requirements and constraints of the problem statement. It correctly handles all edge cases and generates the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
