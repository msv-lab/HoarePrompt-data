Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is "zz", `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'` to the string `word`. However, since `alphabet` is not defined in the given context, we assume it is a predefined string containing all alphabets (e.g., `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`). Given that `n` is an input integer, the exact character appended depends on the value of `n`. But without knowing the exact value of `n`, we can only say that `word` is updated to include `'zz'` at the end. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
