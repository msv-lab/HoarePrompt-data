Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variables `i` and the input value for the range function.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `word` is a string based on the value of `n`.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, meaning the loop has already run once (since `i` starts from 0).

4. **Calculate the Next Value of `i`:**
   Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

5. **Determine the Input for the Loop:**
   The number of iterations is determined by the user input, which hasn't changed from the previous iteration. Therefore, the input for the loop remains the same.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - The input for the loop remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an input integer, `word` is a string based on the value of `n`, `i` is 3**.
