Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. It simply reassigns `t` to its current value, which means `t` remains either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. All other variables (`a`, `n`, `i`, `b`, and `t1`) remain unchanged as well.
