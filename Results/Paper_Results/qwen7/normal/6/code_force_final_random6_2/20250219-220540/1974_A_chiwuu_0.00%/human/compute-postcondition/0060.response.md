Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is `t + (a - t1) // 15`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` depending on whether `t % 5 == 0`.
- `t1` is calculated as `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`.
- `t1` is then updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- The code then updates `t` to `t + t2 // 15`.

Since `t2` is `a - t1`, the new value of `t` becomes `t + (a - t1) // 15`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
