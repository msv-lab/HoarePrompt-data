Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y` (number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively).

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`t`).
     - `t = b * 2`: This calculates the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
     - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means the icons perfectly fit into complete 5-cell units, so `t = t // 5`.
     - Otherwise, `t = t // 5 + 1` to account for any remaining cells that need an additional screen.
   - The program then calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons (`t1`).
     - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space in terms of 15 cells (since each screen has 15 cells).
   - It checks if there is enough space for the 1x1 icons (`a`).
     - If `t1 >= a`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space, so no additional screens are needed.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2`).
       - `t2 = a - t1`: This calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need placement.
       - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, it means the remaining icons perfectly fit into complete 15-cell units, so `t = t + t2 // 15`.
       - Otherwise, `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` to account for any remaining icons that need an additional screen.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement to verify the logic:

- For the first test case: `1 1`
  - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`, which is not divisible by 5, so `t = 2 // 5 + 1 = 1`.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`.
  - Since `11 >= 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- For the second test case: `7 2`
  - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`, which is not divisible by 5, so `t = 4 // 5 + 1 = 1`.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`.
  - Since `7 < 7`, we need additional screens.
  - `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0`, so no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `1` (correct).

- For the third test case: `12 4`
  - `t = 4 * 2 = 8`, which is not divisible by 5, so `t = 8 // 5 + 1 = 2`.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`.
  - Since `22 >= 12`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Result: `2` (correct).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
