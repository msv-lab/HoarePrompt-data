Output State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

In this output state, the value of `t2` is updated to `a - t1`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
