Output State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, and the current value of `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`; it simply reassigns `t` to its current value. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `i`, `b`, and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` also remains true.
