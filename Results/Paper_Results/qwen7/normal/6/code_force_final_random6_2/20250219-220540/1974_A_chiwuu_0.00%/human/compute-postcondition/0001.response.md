State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
4. The value of `t` (which is between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution conditions directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
- `i` must be 0 as it is the initial value before the loop starts.

The final state is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.
