Postcondition: **`a` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is updated based on the value of `t2 % 15`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4`, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`.**
