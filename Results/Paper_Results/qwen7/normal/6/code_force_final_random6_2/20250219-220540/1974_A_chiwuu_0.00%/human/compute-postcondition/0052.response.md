Output State: **`a` is now the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is now the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is now an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4**.

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts the string value of `b` into an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
