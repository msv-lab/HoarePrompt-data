Output State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t1` is less than `a`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t2` is not divisible by 15**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. Given that `t2` is `a - t1` and `t1` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, substituting `t2` gives us `t + (a - (t * 15 - b * 4)) // 15 + 1`. This simplifies to `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
