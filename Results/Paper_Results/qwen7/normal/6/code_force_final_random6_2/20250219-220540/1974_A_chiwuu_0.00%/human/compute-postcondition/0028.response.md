Postcondition: `a` is an integer value, `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t1` is updated to `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + t2 // 15` where `t2` is `a - t1`, and if `t2` is divisible by 15, then `t2` is set to `t2 // 15`.
