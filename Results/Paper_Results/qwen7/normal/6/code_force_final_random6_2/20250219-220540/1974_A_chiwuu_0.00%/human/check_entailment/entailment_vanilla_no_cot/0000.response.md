Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to calculate the minimum number of screens is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of Spaces for 2x2 Icons**: 
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which is the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons. However, this calculation should directly give the number of 2x2 icons, so `t = b`.

2. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space should be calculated correctly. The formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. Instead, we need to calculate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation of the number of screens should consider both the 2x2 and 1x1 icons. The current logic does not handle this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of full 5x3 grids needed for 2x2 icons
        t = b
        # Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 5 * 3 * t - b * 4
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        t += -(-a // remaining_space)  # Ceiling division
        print(t)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens is calculated accurately by first determining the number of full 5x3 grids needed for the 2x2 icons and then calculating the remaining space to place the 1x1 icons.
