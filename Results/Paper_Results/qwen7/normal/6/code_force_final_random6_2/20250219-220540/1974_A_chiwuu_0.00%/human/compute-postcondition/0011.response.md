Output State: **`a` is an integer value, `t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is an integer value, and `t` is not divisible by 5**

Explanation: The variable `t` was originally equal to `b * 2`. After executing `t = t // 5 + 1`, `t` is now updated to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `i`, and `b`) remain unchanged and retain their original conditions. Additionally, the new value of `t` must not be divisible by 5.
