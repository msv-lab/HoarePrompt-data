Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Calculation**: 
   - `t = b * 2`: This doubles the number of 2x2 icons.
   - The next part checks if `t` is divisible by 5. If it is, `t` is divided by 5; otherwise, it is divided by 5 and incremented by 1. This calculation seems to be related to determining how many full 5x3 grids are needed to fit the 2x2 icons.
   
3. **Further Calculation**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The condition `if t1 >= a:` checks if there is enough space to fit the 1x1 icons. If so, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If not, it calculates the remaining number of 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`) and further adjusts `t` based on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not.

4. **Final Output**: The value of `t` is printed for each test case.

Now, let's verify if this logic correctly determines the minimum number of screens needed:

- The doubling of `b` and the division by 5 seem to be related to fitting the 2x2 icons into the grid.
- The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` ensures that the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons is considered.
- The final adjustment of `t` based on the remaining 1x1 icons ensures that the minimum number of screens is calculated correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to fit both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Correctness: **True**
