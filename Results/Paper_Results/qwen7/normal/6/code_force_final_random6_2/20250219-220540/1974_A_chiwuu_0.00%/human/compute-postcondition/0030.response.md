To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is an integer value.
   - `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `b` is an integer value.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

2. **Conditions for `t1`:**
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t1` is adjusted to `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + t2 // 15` or `t * 15 - b * 4 // 15 + 1`, where `t2` is `a - t1` and is set to `t2 // 15` if divisible by 15, otherwise `t2` remains as `a - t1`.

Given these conditions, we need to consider the possible values of `t` and how `t1` is adjusted. However, without specific values for `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `t1`. But we can describe the value of `t` based on the given formula.

- `t` is either `b * 2 // 5` or `b * 2 // 5 + 1`.

Since the exact value of `b` is not specified, we can only express `t` in terms of `b`.

Output: **t (where t is either b * 2 // 5 or b * 2 // 5 + 1)**
