Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `b` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `t` is `b * 2 // 5 + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `b` is an integer, `t1` is `b * 28 - (b * 2 // 5) * 15 + b * 4**.

Explanation: The code `t = t // 5 + 1` updates the value of `t` from its previous value `b * 2` to `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
