Output State: **`a` is now an integer value converted from the original string `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `b` is a string**.

The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
