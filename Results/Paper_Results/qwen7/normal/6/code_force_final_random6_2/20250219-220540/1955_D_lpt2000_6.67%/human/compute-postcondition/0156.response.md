Output State: **`nabors` is decremented by 1; `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `nabors` is decremented by 1 as per the initial state. All other variables (`D`, `C`, `E`, `tot`, `aa`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
