Postcondition: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` > 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1; `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1; `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.
