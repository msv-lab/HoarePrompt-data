Postcondition: `tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m+1:]`, and `aa[:n - m - 1]`; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; If `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 2, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 2; Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
