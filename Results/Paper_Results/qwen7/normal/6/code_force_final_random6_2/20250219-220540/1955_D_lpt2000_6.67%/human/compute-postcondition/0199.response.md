Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `tot`, `k`, `C[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `k` remain as per the initial conditions.**

This means that the value of `E[out_aa]` is reduced by 1, while all other variables (`tot`, `k`, `C[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `k`) retain their initial values. The condition for updating `fnd` based on `tot` and `k` remains unchanged, and the constraints on `m` and `n` ensuring elements are left in both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` also remain valid.
