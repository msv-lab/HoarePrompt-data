Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of counts of elements in `aa[:m]` and `bb`; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0; `C` contains counts of elements in `aa[m:]` that were never in `bb` and their count in `C` is incremented by the number of such elements; `E` is now the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `nabors` is decreased by 1; `aa` is updated to a list of integers from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `aa[:m]`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `bb` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `bb`; `C` is now `cnt_bb - D`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is either `fnd + 1` if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0 initially, then `D[out_aa]` is now 0, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If the condition `C[in_aa] > 0` is true, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m:]`, and `aa[:n - m]`; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; If `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 2, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 2; Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m+1:]`, and `aa[:n - m - 1]`, `fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
