Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `tot` (which is the sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`.**

This means that `fnd` is incremented by 1 only if the sum of the values in `D` (`tot`) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `fnd` remains the same. The values of `E[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]` are updated according to their respective conditions, and `tot` is recalculated as the sum of the values in `D`.
