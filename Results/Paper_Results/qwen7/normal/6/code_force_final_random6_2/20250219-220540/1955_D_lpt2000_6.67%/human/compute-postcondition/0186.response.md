Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, and `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0. Depending on the value of `D[out_aa]`, if `C[in_aa]` is initially equal to `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 1. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` becomes `C[in_aa]` + 1 and remains unequal to `D[in_aa]`, while `D[out_aa]` retains its original value.
