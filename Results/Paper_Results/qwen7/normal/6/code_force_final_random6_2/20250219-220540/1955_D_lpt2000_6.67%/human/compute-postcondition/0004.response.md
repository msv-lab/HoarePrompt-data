Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `bb`. The initial conditions for `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `aa` remain unchanged.
