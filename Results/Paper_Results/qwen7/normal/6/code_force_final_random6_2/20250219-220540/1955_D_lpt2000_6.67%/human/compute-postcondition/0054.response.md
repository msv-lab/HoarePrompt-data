Postcondition: `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`. Its value is either decreased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] > 0`), increased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] <= 0`), or decreased by 1 (if `D[out_aa] > 0`). `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`. If `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, then `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is met; if the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is not met, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise (`C[in_aa] != D[in_aa]`), `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is met; if the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is not met, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
