Postcondition: `out_aa` is the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]` with its value either decreased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] > 0` and `D[out_aa] > 0`) or increased by 1 (if `E[out_aa] <= 0` or `D[out_aa] <= 0`). `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`. `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is met. If the condition `D[out_aa] > 0` is not met, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
