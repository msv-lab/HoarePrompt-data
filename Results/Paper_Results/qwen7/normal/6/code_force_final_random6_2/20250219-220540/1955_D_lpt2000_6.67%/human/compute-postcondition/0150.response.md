Output State: **`tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m+1:]`, and `aa[:n - m - 1]`, `fnd` remains unchanged, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tot = sum(D.values())` calculates the sum of the values in dictionary `D` and assigns it to `tot`. This operation does not affect the values of `fnd`, `C[in_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, or `E[out_aa]`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged. The only change is that `tot` now holds the sum of the values in `D`.
