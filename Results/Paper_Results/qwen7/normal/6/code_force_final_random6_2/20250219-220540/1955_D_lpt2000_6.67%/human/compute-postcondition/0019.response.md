Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is still greater than -1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `C[out_aa] += 1` increments the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. Given the initial state, `D[out_aa]` is greater than -1, so it remains unchanged but is noted to be greater than -1. The value of `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and the condition that `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 remains unaffected.
