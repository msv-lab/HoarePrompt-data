Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, and the value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than -1. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
