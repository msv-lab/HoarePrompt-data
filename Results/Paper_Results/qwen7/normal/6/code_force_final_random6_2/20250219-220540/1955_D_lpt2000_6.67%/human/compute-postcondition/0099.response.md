Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now greater than 0 - 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
