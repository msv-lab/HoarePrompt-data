Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `D[out_aa]` exists but does not specify its initial value, the only change is that `D[out_aa]` is now one less than whatever its original value was.
