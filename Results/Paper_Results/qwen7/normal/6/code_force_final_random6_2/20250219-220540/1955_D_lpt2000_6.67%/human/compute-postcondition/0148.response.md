Output State: **`tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m+1:]`, and `aa[:n - m - 1]`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, if `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]` + 2, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 and `C[in_aa]` becomes `D[in_aa]` + 2; otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, depending on the value of `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]`, either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `E[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1, while all other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
