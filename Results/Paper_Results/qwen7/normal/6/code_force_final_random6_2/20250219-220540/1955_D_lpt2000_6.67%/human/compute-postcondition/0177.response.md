Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element**

Explanation: The variable `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Given the initial condition that `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, after subtracting 1, `D[out_aa]` becomes less than or equal to -1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
