Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, and depending on the value of `D[out_aa]`, if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 and remains unequal to `D[in_aa]`, and `D[out_aa]` retains its original value.
