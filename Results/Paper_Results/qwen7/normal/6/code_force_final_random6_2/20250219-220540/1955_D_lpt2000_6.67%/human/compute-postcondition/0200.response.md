Postcondition: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` > 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. The values of `tot`, `k`, `C[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, and `m` and `n` must be such that there are still elements left in both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`.**
