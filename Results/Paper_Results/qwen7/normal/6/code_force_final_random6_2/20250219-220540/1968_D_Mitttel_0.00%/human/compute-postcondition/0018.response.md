Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable `_` is not relevant for our adjustment since it is just a placeholder. The key variables here are `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer
   - `n` is an integer from `data[index]`
   - `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`
   - `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`
   - `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`
   - `index` is increased by 16
   - `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`
   - `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`
   - `index` is increased by `n`
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `index`, and `results`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is a positive integer (decremented by 1)
- `n` is an integer from `data[index]`
- `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`
- `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`
- `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`
- `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`
- `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`
- `index` is increased by 16 and then by `n`
- `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (decremented by 1), `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 16 and then by `n`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
