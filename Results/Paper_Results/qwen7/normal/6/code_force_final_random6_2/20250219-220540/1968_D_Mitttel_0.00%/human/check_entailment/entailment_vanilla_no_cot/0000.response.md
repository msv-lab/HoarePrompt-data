Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The `calculate_score` function correctly computes the score for a given starting position, taking into account cycles in the permutation. However, in `func_1`, the scores for Bodya and Sasha are calculated independently without considering their moves simultaneously. This means that the scores do not reflect the actual game scenario where both players make moves simultaneously.

To fix this, the `func_1` function should call `calculate_score` for both starting positions and then compare the final scores. Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

Additionally, the `calculate_score` function should take the permutation and array as arguments to ensure it works correctly when called from `func_1`. The rest of the code looks correct and follows the logic needed to solve the problem.
