Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`**.

In this output state, the `full_cycles` and `remaining_steps` variables remain unchanged from their initial values. The `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos` variables also remain unchanged. The `remainder_steps` variable stays the same as well. The `score` variable is updated by adding `full_cycles * cycle_score` to its current value.
