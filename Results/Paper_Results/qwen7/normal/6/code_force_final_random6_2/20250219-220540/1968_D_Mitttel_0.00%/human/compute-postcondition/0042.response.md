Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, and `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`. `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, and `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`. `index` is increased by `3 * n + 28`. `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it was decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, and `PS` will be as they were last updated within the loop. The lists `p` and `a` will also be as they were last updated. The variable `index` will have been incremented by the total amount required for all iterations, which is `3 * n + 28`. Finally, the `results` list will contain the outcomes of calling `func_1` for each iteration of the loop.
