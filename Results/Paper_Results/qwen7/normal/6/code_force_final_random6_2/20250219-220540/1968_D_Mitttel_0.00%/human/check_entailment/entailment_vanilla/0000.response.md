Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
- It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
- It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

#### Function `calculate_score`
- This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
- It simulates the game for `k` turns.
- It handles cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation when a cycle is detected.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
- It reads the entire input into a string, splits it, and processes each test case.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
- It prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**
   - The logic is straightforward and correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players.
   - It compares the scores and returns the correct result.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**
   - The function correctly simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It handles cycles efficiently by calculating the cycle length and score, then using modular arithmetic to determine how many full cycles fit within `k` turns and the remaining steps.
   - The implementation is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

3. **Function `func_2`**
   - The function reads the input correctly and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
   - The handling of input and output is correct and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the functions are implemented correctly according to the problem description. The logic in each function is sound, and the code handles the input and output as required.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
