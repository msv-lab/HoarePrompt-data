Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]` (and now updated), `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]` and remains unchanged, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 16 and then by `n + 4`.**

Explanation: The line `index += 4` increases the value of `index` by 4. The other variables remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes the increase in `index` by 4 after the original increase by 16.
