Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `PB` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 26`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 3]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`, `p` is updated to a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 4, `index` is increased by `n`**

Explanation: The line `index += n` increases the value of `index` by `n`. Since `index` was previously increased by `2 * n + 24`, the new value of `index` becomes `2 * n + 24 + n = 3 * n + 24`. However, the problem statement specifies that `index` is increased by `4` after the function call, making the final increase `3 * n + 28`. But since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we keep it as `3 * n + 24` for the sake of clarity and then add `4` as per the given code.
