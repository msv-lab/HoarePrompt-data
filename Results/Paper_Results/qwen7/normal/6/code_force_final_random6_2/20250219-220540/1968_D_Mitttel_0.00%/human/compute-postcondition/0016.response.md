Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 16, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index - n` and having length `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `index`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged except that `index` is increased by 16 and then by `n`. The function call returns a value, which is assigned to `result`.
