Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 8, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`, `index` is increased by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increases the value of `index` by the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, the new value of `index` will be the original value of `index` plus `n`. Additionally, the precondition that `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n` remains valid, and now `index` has been increased by `n` to point to the next position in the list. Therefore, `index` is increased by 4 (from the initial increase) plus `n` (from the current line of code), making it increased by 8 in total.
