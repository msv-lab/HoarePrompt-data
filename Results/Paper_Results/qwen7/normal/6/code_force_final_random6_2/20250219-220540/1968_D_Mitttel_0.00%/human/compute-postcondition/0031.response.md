Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]` and is updated, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]` and remains unchanged, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 20`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code updates `n` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables remain in their previous states, except for `k` which is now assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is increased by `2 * n + 20`. The `result` variable is set to the return value of the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, and `results` is a list with one additional element, which is this `result`.
