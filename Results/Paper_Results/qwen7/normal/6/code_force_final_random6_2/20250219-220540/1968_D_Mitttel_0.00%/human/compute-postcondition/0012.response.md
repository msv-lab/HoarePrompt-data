Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 4, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a list `p` by converting each element in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` (inclusive) into an integer. The values of `t`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, and `index` remain unchanged, but `index` is increased by 4 due to the slice operation. The new list `p` contains the integer values from the specified slice of `data`.
