Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable), but we don't need to worry about it since it doesn't hold any state. The relevant variables that can be adjusted are `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `index`, `result`, and `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `t` is a positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the New State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be a positive integer. Therefore, `t` should be decremented by 1 from its previous value.

4. **Adjust Other States**: Since the loop does not modify `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `index`, `result`, or `results` within the loop, these values remain unchanged.

5. **Construct the New State**: Based on the above reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now a positive integer decremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]` and is updated, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]` and remains unchanged, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 20`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`.**
