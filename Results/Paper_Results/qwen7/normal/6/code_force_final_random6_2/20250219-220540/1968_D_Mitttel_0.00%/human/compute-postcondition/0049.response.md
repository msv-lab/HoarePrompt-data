Output State: **All elements in the `results` list have been printed.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `result` will have iterated through every element in the `results` list, printing each one. Since the loop continues until there are no more elements in `results`, once the loop finishes, `results` will be empty, and all elements within it have been printed out.
