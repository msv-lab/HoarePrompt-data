Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the provided code.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
   - It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic is straightforward and correct.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function simulates the game for `k` turns starting from a given position.
   - It handles cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation.
   - The cycle detection and scoring mechanism is implemented correctly.
   - The use of modular arithmetic to handle the remaining steps after completing full cycles is also correct.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
   - The handling of input and output is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall structure of the program is sound.

Final: **True**
