Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length - 1` and must be greater than 0, `score` is `score + 2 * score`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `score += a[current_pos - 1]` adds the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to `score`. From the initial state, we know that `a[current_pos - 1]` is equal to `2 * score`. Therefore, `score` becomes `score + 2 * score`, which simplifies to `3 * score`. All other variables remain unchanged.
