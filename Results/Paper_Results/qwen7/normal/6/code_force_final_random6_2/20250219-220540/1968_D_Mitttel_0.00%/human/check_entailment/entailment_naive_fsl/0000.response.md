Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the scores for both players. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function only considers the direct path from the starting position without accounting for the possibility of moving to the position indicated by the permutation value. This means that the function does not fully simulate the game rules where players can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation value.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Bodya
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  Draw
  ```

In this example, let's walk through the game for both players:

**Bodya:**
- Start at position 3.
- First turn: Score = 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5, stays at position 3.
- Second turn: Score = 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10, stays at position 3.
- Final score: 10.

**Sasha:**
- Start at position 2.
- First turn: Score = 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2, moves to position 1.
- Second turn: Score = 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9, stays at position 1.
- Final score: 9.

Since Bodya has a final score of 10 and Sasha has a final score of 9, Bodya should win. However, the program incorrectly returns "Draw" because it does not properly account for the possibility of moving to the position indicated by the permutation value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
