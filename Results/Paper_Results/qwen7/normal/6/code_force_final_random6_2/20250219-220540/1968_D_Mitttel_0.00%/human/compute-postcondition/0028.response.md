Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]` (and now updated), `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]` and remains unchanged, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 20`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. The function call does not provide any further details about what `func_1` does, so we know that `result` will hold whatever `func_1` returns. All other variables remain unchanged except for `index`, which is increased by `n + 20 + n = 2 * n + 20`.
