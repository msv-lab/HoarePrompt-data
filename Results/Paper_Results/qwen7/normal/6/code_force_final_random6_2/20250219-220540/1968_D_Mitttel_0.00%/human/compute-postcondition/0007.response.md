Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`.**

The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be a positive integer remains unchanged. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
