Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `PB` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `2 * n + 26`, `k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is updated to the integer from `data[index + 3]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1`, `p` is updated to a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by 4, `index` is increased by `n`, `a` is a list of integers converted from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n**.

Explanation: The code `index += n` simply increments the value of `index` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
