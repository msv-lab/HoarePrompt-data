Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the value of the first integer input, `k` is the value of the second integer input, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `c` is 0**.

Explanation: The code sets `maxi` to 0, which updates the initial state where `maxi` was being updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`. Since `c` is initially 0, `maxi` is now explicitly set to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
