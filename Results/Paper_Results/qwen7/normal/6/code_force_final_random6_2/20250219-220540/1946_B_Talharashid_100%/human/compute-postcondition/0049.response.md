Output State: **`l` must have at least one element; `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `maxi` to be the maximum of the current value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. Since `l` must have at least one element, the value of `c` is assumed to be one of the elements in `l`. The value of `maxi` is updated accordingly, but the list `l` remains unchanged.
