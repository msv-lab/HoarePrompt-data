Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is an empty list, `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

This means that the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the integers obtained from the input split by space. The variable `l` remains an empty list, `c` and `maxi` are yet to be updated based on the loop conditions, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains unchanged as it is outside the scope of the given code snippet.
