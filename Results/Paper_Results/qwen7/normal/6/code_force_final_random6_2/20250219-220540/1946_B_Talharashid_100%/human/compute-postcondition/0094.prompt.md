Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxi` is 0, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the value of the first integer input, `k` is the value of the second integer input, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `c` is 0
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is now 0, then `maxi` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of `ele` from the list, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi` before the operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c + ele` and the current `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements (one less than before), `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
