Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int that must have at least one element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `c` is 0.**

The code `c = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `c`. Since the initial state already sets `c` to 0, the value of `c` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values as well.
