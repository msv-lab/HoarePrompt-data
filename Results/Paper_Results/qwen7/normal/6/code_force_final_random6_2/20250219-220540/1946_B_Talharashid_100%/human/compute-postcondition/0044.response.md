Output State: **`l` must have at least one element, `ele` is a non-negative number, `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`, and `c` is now `c + ele`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by `ele`. Since `ele` is a non-negative number, `c` becomes `c + ele`. The conditions for `l`, `ele`, and `c` remain the same as the initial state, except for `c` which is updated to `c + ele`.
