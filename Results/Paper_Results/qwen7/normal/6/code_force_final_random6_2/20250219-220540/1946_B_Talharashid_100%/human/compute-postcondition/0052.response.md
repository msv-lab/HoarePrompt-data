Output State: **`l` must have at least one element; `c` is increased by the value of `ele`; `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and `ele`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between the current value of `c` (which was increased by `ele`) and the previous value of `maxi`. The list `l` and the variable `ele` remain unchanged from their initial state.
