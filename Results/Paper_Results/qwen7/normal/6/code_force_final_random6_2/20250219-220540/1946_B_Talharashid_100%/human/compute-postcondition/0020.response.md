Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element removed), `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` remains 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` retain their initial values, `c` is updated based on the condition `ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele)`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.
