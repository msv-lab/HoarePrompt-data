Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int, `c` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `t`, `n`, `k`, or `l`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `c` is now set to 0.
