Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element removed), `c` is the sum of `c` and `ele` if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` remains 0, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code `c += ele` updates the value of `c` by adding `ele` to its current value. The condition for updating `c` is that `ele` should be less than 0 and `c` should be less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`. If these conditions are met, `c` is updated; otherwise, `c` remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi`) remain unaffected by this operation.
