Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element removed).
   - `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value if `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)`, otherwise `c` remains 0.
   - `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `l`, the next element `ele` will be the next item in the list `l`.
   - After processing the current `ele`, `c` will be updated based on the condition provided.
   - `maxi` will be updated to the maximum of the new `c` and 0.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` will be the list without the current `ele` since the loop will process the next element.
   - `c` will be updated based on the condition provided.
   - `maxi` will be updated to the maximum of the new `c` and 0.

Given the above, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the removal of the current `ele` from `l` and the update of `c` and `maxi`.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
- `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element and the current `ele` removed).
- `c` is updated based on the condition provided for the current `ele`.
- `maxi` is the maximum of the updated `c` and 0.

Since the exact value of `ele` and the updated values of `c` and `maxi` depend on the specific value of `ele`, we cannot provide concrete values for them. However, we can represent the general form of the state.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int (with the first element and the current `ele` removed), `c` is updated based on the condition provided for the current `ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of the updated `c` and 0.**
