Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers using the `map` function. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`. The variables `t` and `i` retain their initial values from the initial state.
