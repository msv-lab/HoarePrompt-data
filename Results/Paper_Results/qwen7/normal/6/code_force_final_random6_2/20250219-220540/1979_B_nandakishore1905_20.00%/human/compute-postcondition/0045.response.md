Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the absolute difference `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new variable `l` is assigned the binary string representation of `k`.
