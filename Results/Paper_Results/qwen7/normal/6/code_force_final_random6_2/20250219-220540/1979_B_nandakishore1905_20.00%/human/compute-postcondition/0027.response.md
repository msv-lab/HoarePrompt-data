Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, but since its calculation is not explicitly shown in the code, it is mentioned as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
