Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `i` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2. Otherwise, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.
