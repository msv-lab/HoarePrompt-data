Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of two, and if `n` is 0 and `m` is even, then `n` remains 0 and `m` remains even. Otherwise, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.
