Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is equal to `t`, so `i` is also a positive integer within the same range.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
- `k` is a power of 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k)
```

Given that `k` is a power of 2, it means `k` can take values like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, `k` could be any power of 2.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2)**
