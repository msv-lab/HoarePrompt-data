Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the two integers. Depending on the value of this difference, it prints one of three possible outcomes: the difference itself if it is a power of 2, 1 if the first integer is 0 and the second is odd, or the difference minus the highest power of 2 less than or equal to the difference otherwise.**
