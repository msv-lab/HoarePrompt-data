Output: **2**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `i` is defined as `t + 1`, so `i` will be one more than the value of `t`. The variables `n` and `m` are defined as the first and second input integers, respectively, but their specific values are not provided. Lastly, `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, but again, the specific values of `n` and `m` are not given. 

The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the output is **2**.
