Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `n` and `m` to `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated as follows:
- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` remains `t + 1`.
- `n` remains the first input integer.
- `m` remains the second input integer.
- `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
