Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `t + 1`.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `m` is the second input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
