Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is an even number and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, the problem requires checking if it's possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.

For example:
- A \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
- A \(2 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The function `func_1` fails to account for these conditions. It only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
