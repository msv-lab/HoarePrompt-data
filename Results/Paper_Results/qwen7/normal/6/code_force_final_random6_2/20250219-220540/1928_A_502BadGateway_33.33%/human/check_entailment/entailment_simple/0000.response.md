Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. 

Let's analyze the logic in `func_1`:
- If \(b\) is even, the function returns 'yes'.
- If \(b\) is odd, the function returns 'no'.

This logic is based on the following observations:
- If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle along the width \(b\) into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles. These two smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
- If \(b\) is odd, Bob cannot achieve a different rectangle through any cut and rearrangement because any cut will result in at least one dimension being odd, and the resulting rectangles can only be rearranged to form the original dimensions or their 90-degree rotations.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the function correctly identifies whether a different rectangle can be formed based on whether \(b\) is even or odd.

Therefore, the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
