Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, but this is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the original rectangle. According to the problem statement, Bob can form another rectangle if the original rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. **1x1**: This cannot be cut into two rectangles, so the function correctly returns 'no'.
2. **2x1**: This can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, and no new rectangle can be formed, so the function correctly returns 'no'.
3. **2x6**: This can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, so the function should return 'yes'.
4. **3x2**: This can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, so the function should return 'yes'.
5. **2x2**: This can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, so the function should return 'yes'.
6. **2x4**: This can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, so the function should return 'yes'.
7. **6x3**: This can be cut into two 6x1.5 rectangles, but since we are dealing with integer dimensions, this cannot happen directly, and no new rectangle can be formed, so the function should return 'no'.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. It only checks if `b` is even, which is not a sufficient condition for forming a new rectangle.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
