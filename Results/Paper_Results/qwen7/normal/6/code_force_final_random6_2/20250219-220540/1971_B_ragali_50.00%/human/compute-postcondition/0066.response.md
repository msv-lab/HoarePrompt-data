Output State: **`a` now contains the set `{i}`, `i` is the next element in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `a.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `a`. Since `a` initially contained the next element from `s` and `i` was the next element in `s`, after executing the code, `a` will contain both elements, but since sets do not allow duplicate values, `a` will only contain one instance of `i`. The value of `i` remains the next element in `s`.
