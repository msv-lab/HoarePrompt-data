Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input().strip(' '))` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. This integer is then assigned to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, the new state reflects that `t` now holds the input integer, which is still within the specified range.
