Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string without leading or trailing spaces, `i` is the first character of the original string `s`, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`, `newstr` is the string `s` split into two halves and concatenated in reverse order, `isreverse` is the reversed version of string `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` remains unchanged. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` becomes equal to `s`.**
