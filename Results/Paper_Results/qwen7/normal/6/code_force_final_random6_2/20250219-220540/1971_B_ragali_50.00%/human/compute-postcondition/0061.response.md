Output State: **`a` contains the element `i`, and the other variables are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a.add(i)` adds the element `i` to the set `a`. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that `a` now contains the element `i`.
