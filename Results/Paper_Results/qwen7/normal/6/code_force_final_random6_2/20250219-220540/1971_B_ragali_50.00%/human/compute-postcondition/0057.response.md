Output State: **`s` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `i` is the second-to-last character of the new `s`, `a` is a set containing each unique character from the new `s` once, `t` is reduced by 1, and `isreverse` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s = input().strip(' ')` takes an input string, strips any leading and trailing spaces, and assigns the result back to `s`. The value of `i` is updated to be the second-to-last character of the new `s`. The set `a` contains each unique character from the new `s`, and `t` is reduced by 1. The variable `isreverse` remains unchanged.
