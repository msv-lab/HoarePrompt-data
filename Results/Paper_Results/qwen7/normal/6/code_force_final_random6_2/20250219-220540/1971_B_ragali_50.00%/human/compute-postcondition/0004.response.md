Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. Here, `i` is the loop variable and `s` is the iterable being iterated over.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head objects**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable, and its initial value is not specified in the loop head. However, since the loop is iterating over `s`, `i` will take on each element of `s` during each iteration.
   - `s`: This is the iterable being iterated over. The problem states that `s` is a string without leading or trailing spaces.

3. **Adjust the states of the objects in the loop head**:
   - Since `i` will take on each element of `s` during each iteration, the initial value of `i` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition. We only need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string (since an empty string would result in no iterations).
   - `s` must be a non-empty string because if `s` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Consider other given states**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0: This state is not related to the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `i` must be 1: This state is not relevant to the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `a` is an empty set: This state is not related to the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `s` must be a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string without leading or trailing spaces**
