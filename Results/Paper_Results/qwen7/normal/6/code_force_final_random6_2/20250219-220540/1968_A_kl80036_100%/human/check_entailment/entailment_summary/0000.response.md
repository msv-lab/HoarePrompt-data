Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The provided program simply sets \( y = x - 1 \) for each test case and prints it. This approach does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
- For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
  - If \( y = x - 1 = 9 \), then \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
  - However, if \( y = 5 \), then \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the same value but with a different \( y \).
- The program's logic does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. It only checks the largest possible \( y \) less than \( x \).

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
