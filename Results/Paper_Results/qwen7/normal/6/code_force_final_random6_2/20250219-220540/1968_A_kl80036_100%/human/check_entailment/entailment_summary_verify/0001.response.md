### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The provided solution sets \( y = x - 1 \).
   - It then prints \( y \).

3. **Checking the Solution**:
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be at least 1 because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and hence coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x \).

4. **Verification**:
   - We need to check if this \( y \) always gives the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - Consider another potential \( y \). If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) other than 1 (since \( y \neq 1 \) because \( y < x \)), then \( \gcd(x, y) \) would be greater than 1, but \( y \) itself would be less than \( x - 1 \). Hence, \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) would be less than \( x \).
   - However, we must also consider the possibility that \( y \) could be a larger divisor of \( x \) that still results in a higher sum. For example, if \( x = 10 \), then \( y = 5 \) (a divisor of 10) would give \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \), which is equal to \( x \). But \( y = 9 \) would give \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \), which is also equal to \( x \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - While \( y = x - 1 \) ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) and thus \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x \), it does not necessarily guarantee the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for all \( x \). There could be other divisors of \( x \) that yield the same maximum value.
