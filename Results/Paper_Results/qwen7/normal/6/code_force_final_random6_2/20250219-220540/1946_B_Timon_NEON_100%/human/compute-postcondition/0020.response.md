Postcondition: **`segments_variants` is a list containing either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] when `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] when `max_segment[0]` is equal to `new_segment[0]`. `new_segment` is now an empty list `[]`. `max_segment` is updated to either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] based on the comparison. `max_sum` remains -1. `arr` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list `[]`.**
