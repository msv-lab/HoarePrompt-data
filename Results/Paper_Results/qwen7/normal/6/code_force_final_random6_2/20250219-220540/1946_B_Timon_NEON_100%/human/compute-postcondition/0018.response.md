Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0 + arr[i], 0], `max_sum` is -1, `arr` is not an empty list.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. Since the initial value of `max_segment[0]` is 0, after the operation, `max_segment[0]` becomes `0 + arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
