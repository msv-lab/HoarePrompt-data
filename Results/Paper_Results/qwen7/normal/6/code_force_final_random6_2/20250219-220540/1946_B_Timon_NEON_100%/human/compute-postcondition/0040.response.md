Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is non-negative, otherwise it is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`. `max_segment` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `i` is `i + 1`.
