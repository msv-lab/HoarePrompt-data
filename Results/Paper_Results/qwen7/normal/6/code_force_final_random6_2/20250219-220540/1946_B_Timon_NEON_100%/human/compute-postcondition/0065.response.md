Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` reflects the current best segment found, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list. This new element is created by concatenating `new_segment` (which is initially an empty list) with `[len(arr) - 1]`. Since `new_segment` is empty, the new element added to `segments_variants` is simply `[len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
