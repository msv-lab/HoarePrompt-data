Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`.
   - `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i]` is non-negative or not.
   - `max_sum` remains `-1`.
   - `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, but since we don't know the exact value of `arr[i]` from the previous state, we cannot assume any change in `arr`.
   - `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum` are not directly affected by the loop head, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State:**
**`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i]` is non-negative or not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1.**

State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i]` is non-negative or not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**
