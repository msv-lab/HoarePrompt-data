Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i-1]` is non-negative or not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `new_segment + [i - 1]` to the list `segments_variants`. The value of `new_segment` might have been updated based on the condition of `arr[i]` being non-negative or not before this line of code. The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged at `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.
