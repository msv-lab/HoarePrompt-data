Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains one additional element which is `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` reflects the current best segment found, `max_sum` remains -1, and `i` is equal to the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `segments_variants`. This new element is composed of the `max_segment` (which is a list containing the sum of the segment and the end index of the segment) plus the end index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`). All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
