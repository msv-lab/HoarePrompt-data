Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list containing either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] when `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] when `max_segment[0]` is equal to `new_segment[0]`. `new_segment` remains unchanged in both cases. `max_segment` is updated to either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'] based on the comparison. `max_sum` remains -1. `arr` remains unchanged. The current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.
