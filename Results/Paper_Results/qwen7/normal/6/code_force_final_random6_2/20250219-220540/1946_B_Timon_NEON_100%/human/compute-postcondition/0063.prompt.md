Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(arr)):
    if new_segment:
        if arr[i] < 0:
            if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
            else:
                segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                max_segment = new_segment
            new_segment = []
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            new_segment[0] += arr[i]
    else:
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            new_segment = [arr[i], i]
        max_segment[0] += arr[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either ['max_segment + [i - 1]'] or ['new_segment', 'i - 1'], depending on the comparison between `max_segment[0]` and `new_segment[0]`. `new_segment` is an empty list. `max_segment` is updated accordingly. `max_sum` remains -1. `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes [arr[i], i] and `max_segment` is updated to [max_segment[0] + arr[i], i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i]` is non-negative or not. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, otherwise `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment` and `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`. `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i - 1]'` or `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i-1]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is non-negative, and `max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
