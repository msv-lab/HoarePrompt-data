Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]'` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i]` is non-negative or not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
