Postcondition: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i]']` or `['new_segment', 'i']`, `new_segment` is an updated list with its first element increased by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`, otherwise `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment` and `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`. `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. `i` is incremented by 1.**
