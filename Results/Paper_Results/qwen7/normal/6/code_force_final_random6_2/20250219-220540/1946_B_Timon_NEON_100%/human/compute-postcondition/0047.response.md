Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment`, `new_segment` is updated based on whether `arr[i-1]` is non-negative or not, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `max_segment = new_segment` assigns the current value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
