Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list that may contain either `['max_segment + [i - 1]']` or `['new_segment + [i - 1]']`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `arr` remains unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than 0, in which case `new_segment` is updated to `arr[i] + new_segment`, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, and `new_segment` is reset to an empty list. If `arr[i]` is non-negative, `new_segment` becomes `[arr[i], i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_segment` to an empty list. This does not affect any other variables or their conditions. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state, with only `new_segment` being explicitly set to an empty list.
