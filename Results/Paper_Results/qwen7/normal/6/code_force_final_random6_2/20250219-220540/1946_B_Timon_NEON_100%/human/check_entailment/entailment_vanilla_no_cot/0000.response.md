Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incomplete Function 3**: The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented. It is expected to calculate the maximum sum after performing `k` operations, but it currently does nothing.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: 
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of subarrays, but its logic is flawed. It does not correctly handle the merging of subarrays and the insertion of their sums.
   - The function does not account for the fact that we can insert the sum of any subarray anywhere in the array, which could potentially increase the sum more effectively than just considering contiguous subarrays.

3. **Lack of Handling `k` Operations**: The code does not implement the logic to perform `k` operations as specified in the problem statement. It only finds the maximum sum of subarrays without considering how to use these operations to maximize the final array sum.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Implement `func_3` to handle the `k` operations.
- Correctly merge subarrays and insert their sums into the array to maximize the final sum.
- Ensure the solution works efficiently within the constraints (e.g., using dynamic programming or other optimization techniques).

Here's a high-level approach to solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the initial sum of the array.
2. Determine the optimal strategy to maximize the sum by inserting sums of subarrays.
3. Use dynamic programming or other methods to handle up to `k` operations efficiently.
4. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
