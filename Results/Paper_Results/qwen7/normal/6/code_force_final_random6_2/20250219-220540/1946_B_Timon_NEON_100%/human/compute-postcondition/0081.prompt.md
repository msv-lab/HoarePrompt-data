Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `segments_variants` now contains `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` reflects the current best segment found, `max_sum` remains -1, `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` and the length of `segment` is not 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total_max_segment` is now equal to the next `segment` in `segments_variants` and the length of the next `segment` is not 1. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` remains unchanged and is still equal to the next `segment` in `segments_variants`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total_max_segment` is now equal to the current `segment` if the first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of `segment` and the length of `segment` is not 1. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
