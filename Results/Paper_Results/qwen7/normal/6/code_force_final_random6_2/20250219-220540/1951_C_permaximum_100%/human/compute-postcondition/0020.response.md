Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and now `price` and `day` are popped from the priority queue `pq`.**

Explanation: The code `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` pops the first element from the priority queue `pq` and assigns the first element to `price` and the second element to `day`. The other variables (`total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `tickets_to_buy`, and `price_increase`) remain unchanged according to their previous definitions.
