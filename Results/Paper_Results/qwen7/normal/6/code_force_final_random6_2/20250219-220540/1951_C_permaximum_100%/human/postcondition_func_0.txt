The function accepts four parameters: the number of sale days `n`, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the number of tickets to be bought at the end `k`, and a list of ticket prices for each day `prices`. It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets considering a price increase for each purchase. The function achieves this by using a priority queue to manage the lowest priced tickets available each day, ensuring that tickets are bought in the most cost-effective manner possible given the constraints.
