Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets under the given constraints.
2. The function `func_1` uses a priority queue (`pq`) to keep track of the cheapest tickets available each day.
3. It iteratively pops the cheapest ticket from the queue, calculates the cost considering any previous price increases, and updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought.
4. The function ensures that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed `m` and that the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.
5. The state analysis before the function call and after the function execution matches the expected behavior and data structures used.
6. The provided example test cases match the expected output, indicating that the function works correctly for the given constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
