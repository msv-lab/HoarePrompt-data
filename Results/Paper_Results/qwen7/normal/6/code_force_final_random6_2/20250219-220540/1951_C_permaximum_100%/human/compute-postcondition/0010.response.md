Output State: **`tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` remains the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` remains the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`.**

Explanation: The variable `tickets_bought` is incremented by `tickets_to_buy`. All other variables (`total_cost`, `pq`, `price`, and `day`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The updated value of `tickets_bought` is calculated as the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought` plus `tickets_to_buy`.
