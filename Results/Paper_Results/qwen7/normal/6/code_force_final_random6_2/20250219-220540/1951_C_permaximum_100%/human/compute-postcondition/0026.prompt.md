Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tickets_bought` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `price_increase` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while tickets_bought < k:
    price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
    price += price_increase
    tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
    total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
    tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
    price_increase += tickets_to_buy


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought) + tickets_to_buy`, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` remains the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` remains the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`; `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is the sum of its previous value and `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price_increase` is increased by `tickets_to_buy` + `tickets_to_buy`, `price` is increased by `price_increase` + `tickets_to_buy` + `tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy` + `tickets_to_buy`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
