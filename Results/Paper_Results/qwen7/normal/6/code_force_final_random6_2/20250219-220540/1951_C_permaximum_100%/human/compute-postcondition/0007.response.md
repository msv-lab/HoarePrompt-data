Output State: **`tickets_bought` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` is the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` is the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`**.

Explanation: The code `price += price_increase` increments the value of `price` by `price_increase`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
