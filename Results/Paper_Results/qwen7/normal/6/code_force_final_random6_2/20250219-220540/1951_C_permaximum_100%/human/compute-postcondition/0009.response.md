Output State: **`tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` remains a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index excluding the one just popped, `price` remains the price of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` remains the index of the lowest price tuple popped from `pq`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total_cost` by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `tickets_bought` is updated to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)` as per the initial state.
