Output State: **`pq` is a heap from which an element (price, day) was popped; `price` is the first element of the popped tuple; `day` is the second element of the popped tuple.**

Explanation: The line `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` pops the smallest element from the heap `pq` and assigns the first element of the popped tuple to `price` and the second element to `day`. The heap `pq` is modified to remove the element that was just popped.
