Output State: **`tickets_bought` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap.**

The code simply initializes the variable `tickets_bought` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the initial values of `total_cost`, `pq`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `pq` remains a heap.
