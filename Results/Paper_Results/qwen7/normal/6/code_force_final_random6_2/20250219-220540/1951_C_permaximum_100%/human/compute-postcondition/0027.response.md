Output State: **The program returns total_cost which is the sum of the cost of buying k tickets considering the price increase for each purchase.**

This means that the program returns the total cost calculated based on the initial state where `tickets_bought` equals `k`, and the cost of each ticket increases with each purchase. The exact value of `total_cost` depends on the initial price of the tickets and the specified increase for each subsequent ticket purchase.
