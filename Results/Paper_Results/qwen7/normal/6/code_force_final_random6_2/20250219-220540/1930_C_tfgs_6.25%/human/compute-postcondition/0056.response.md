Output State: **`ans` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.
