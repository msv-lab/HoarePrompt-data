Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `adv` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the elements `a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1`, `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, and `a[i - 1] - 1`, `j` is now `j + 3`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `a[i - 1]` will be `a[1]` or `a[2]` respectively. The value of `j` is increased by 3, and since `adv` is 0, there is no change in `cnt` or `counter[a[i - 1]]`. Therefore, the updated list `ans` includes the new element `a[i]` and the previous elements remain unchanged.
