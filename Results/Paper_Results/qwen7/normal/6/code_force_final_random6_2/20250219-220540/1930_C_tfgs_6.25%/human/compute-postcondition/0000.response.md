Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user, constrained to be between 1 and 3⋅10^5.
