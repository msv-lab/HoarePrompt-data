Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition involves `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 (assuming it was less than `n`).
   - Therefore, if `i` was previously `k`, now `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`:
- If `i` was `k`, then `i_new` is `k + 1`.

Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i_new` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` must still be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\).

So, the updated state is:
State: **`a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\)**.
