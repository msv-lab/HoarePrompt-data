Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `adv` is min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]]), `ans` now includes `a[i]`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `adv` is assigned the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `counter[a[i]]` are updated according to the initial state, and no other variables are affected.
