### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene, who also plays optimally to minimize your score.
2. **Given Program Analysis**: The provided function `func()` reads input from standard input, but its logic does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the function is trying to calculate the length of a list minus the length of a set of tokens from the input line. This operation does not reflect the logic needed to solve the problem.
3. **Expected Logic**:
   - For each test case, we need to analyze the cards in your hand.
   - Determine how many cards Nene will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
   - The key insight is that Nene will always play a card that is not yet on the table to avoid giving you points, and if forced to give you a point, she will do so in a way that minimizes your future points.
4. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - Count the frequency of each card in your hand.
   - For each unique card, if there is another card of the same value in your hand, Nene will play one of those cards to avoid giving you a point.
   - Otherwise, Nene will play the card to give you a point.
   - The maximum number of points you can get is the number of pairs of cards in your hand minus the number of unique cards that appear only once.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func()` does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
