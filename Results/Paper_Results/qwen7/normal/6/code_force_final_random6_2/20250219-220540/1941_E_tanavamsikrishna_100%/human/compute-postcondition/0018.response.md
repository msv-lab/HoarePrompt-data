Output State: `i` must be at least `2d + 2` and the minimum value in `min_heap` must remain less than or equal to `-2`.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be at least `2d + 2`, and the minimum value present in `min_heap` will still be less than or equal to `-2`. The condition inside the loop ensures that the loop continues as long as the minimum value in `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Given that the loop has run for at least 3 iterations, it implies that `i` has incremented sufficiently to satisfy the condition with the current minimum value in `min_heap`.
