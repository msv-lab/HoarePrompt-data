### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports for a single row of the river under the given constraints.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the smallest value within a sliding window of size `d` and updates the row accordingly.
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements of the row and then uses a sliding window approach to update the rest of the row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges across `k` consecutive rows.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible segment of `k` consecutive rows and stores these in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case by calling `func_2`.
   - The input and output handling is correct, reading the number of test cases and processing each one individually.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost for multiple rows is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies noted in the provided code.
