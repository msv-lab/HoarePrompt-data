Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `d`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = d` and continues as long as `i < len(row)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least `2d + 2`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `2d + 3`.

4. **Check if the loop condition is still satisfied**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(row)`.
   - Given that `i` is now `2d + 3`, we need to ensure that `2d + 3 < len(row)`.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - The state of `min_heap` and `row[i]` does not change based on the loop head alone, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, but this update is not part of the loop head and thus remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `i` and the condition for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2d + 3, `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to -2 and now includes (row[i], i), and `row[i]` is updated to e[0] + row[i] + 1**.
