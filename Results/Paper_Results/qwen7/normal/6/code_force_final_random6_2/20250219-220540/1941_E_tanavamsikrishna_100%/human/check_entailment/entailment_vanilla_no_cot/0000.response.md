Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of building bridges with the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row of the river, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports in the current segment of the row.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function processes the input for each test case. It reads the dimensions of the river (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of each cell in the river (`rows`). It then applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost for placing supports in that row. Finally, it calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

The program handles all the specified constraints and examples provided in the problem statement. It correctly computes the minimum cost for placing supports in each row and then finds the optimal placement of `k` bridges across consecutive rows to achieve the overall minimum cost.
