Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(costs) - (k - 1) - 1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Initial State of `costs`**: The `costs` list is defined such that each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`. Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the initial state of `costs` is important.

4. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` should be `0` for the loop to start executing.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Given that `costs` is a list of `n` elements, the condition simplifies to `i < n - (k - 1)` or `i < n - k + 1`.

6. **State Adjustment**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is `0` and that the length of `costs` is at least `k`.

Based on these points, the required adjustments are:

- `i` should be `0`.
- `costs` should have at least `k` elements.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is a list of `n` elements, each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`, and costs must have at least `k` elements, `i` is 0**.
