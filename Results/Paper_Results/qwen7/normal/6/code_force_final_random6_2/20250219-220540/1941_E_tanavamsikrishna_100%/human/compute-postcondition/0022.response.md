Output State: **`i` is at least `2d + 2`, `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2` and now includes `(row[i], i)`, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(row[i], i)` onto the `min_heap`. Since `row[i]` was previously updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, the new value of `row[i]` is included in the heap. The precondition that `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2` remains valid, and now includes the new tuple. The value of `i` and the structure of `min_heap` are updated accordingly.
