Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` is `2d + 3`
  - `min_heap` contains values including `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`
  - `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`
  - The second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `d + 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop continues as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` was less than or equal to `d + 1`.

2. **Current State of Variables:**
   - `i = 2d + 3`
   - The second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is `d + 1` (since it was less than or equal to `d + 1`).

3. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Substituting the current value of `i`:
     \[
     d + 1 \leq (2d + 3) - (d + 2)
     \]
   - Simplifying the right-hand side:
     \[
     d + 1 \leq d + 1
     \]
   - This condition is always true, but we need to ensure that the tuple popped from `min_heap` still satisfies this condition in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the condition is already satisfied, we need to ensure that the tuple popped from `min_heap` in the next iteration still has its second element less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - The second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is `d + 1`, and `i` is `2d + 3`. Therefore, the condition will be satisfied as long as the second element remains `d + 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` to ensure it remains `d + 1` in the next iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` contains values including `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`, `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`, and the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `d + 1` and remain `d + 1` in the next iteration.**
