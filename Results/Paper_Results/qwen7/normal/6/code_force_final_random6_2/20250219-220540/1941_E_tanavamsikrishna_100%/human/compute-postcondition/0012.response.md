Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the situation:

- `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements of `costs` starting from the first element up to the second-to-last element of `costs`.
- `rows`, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values.
- `d` retains its original value.
- `costs` is unchanged.
- `i` is now equal to `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which means `i` is the index where a segment of length `k` can still fit within the list `costs`.

Given this, the `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value among all the sums of consecutive segments of length `k` in the `costs` list.

Since the exact values of `costs` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, we know it will be the smallest sum of any consecutive `k` elements in the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs contains the sums of all possible consecutive segments of length k within the costs list)**
