### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to build \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
- Each bridge must have supports installed such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than \( d \).
- The cost of installing a support in cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row under the given constraints.

1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   row[0] = 1
   for i in range(1, d):
       row[i] = row[i] + 2
   ```
   - This part initializes the first \( d \) elements of the row. While it seems to add a fixed cost, it doesn't reflect the actual problem constraints.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   ```python
   min_heap = [(e, i) for (i, e) in enumerate(row[:d])]
   heapify(min_heap)
   ```
   - A min-heap is initialized with the first \( d \) elements of the row.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   ```python
   for i in range(d, len(row)):
       while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
           pass
       row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
       heappush(min_heap, e)
       heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
   ```
   - The heap operations are intended to manage the placement of supports, but they do not correctly enforce the distance constraint \( d \). The while loop is supposed to remove elements from the heap that are too far away, but it does not handle this correctly. The cost calculation also seems incorrect as it adds a fixed value without considering the actual depth.

#### Function `func_2`
This function processes the entire grid and calculates the minimum cost for building \( k \) bridges.

1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
   rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
   ```
   - Reads the dimensions and the grid.

2. **Calculating Costs**:
   ```python
   costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
   ```
   - Calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of placing supports.

3. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**:
   ```python
   total_costs = []
   for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
       total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
   print(min(total_costs))
   ```
   - Calculates the sum of costs for each set of \( k \) consecutive rows and prints the minimum.

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Heap Implementation**:
   - The heap is used to find the minimum cost of placing supports, but the logic inside the heap operations is flawed. The while loop does not correctly manage the distance constraint \( d \).
   - The cost calculation is fixed and does not depend on the actual depth of the cells.

2. **Distance Constraint**:
   - The function does not enforce the distance constraint \( d \) correctly. The placement of supports is not managed properly, leading to incorrect cost calculations.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation in `func_1` is fixed and does not reflect the actual problem requirements. The cost should depend on the depth of the cells, but the current implementation does not account for this.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic for building bridges and calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports. The heap usage and cost calculation are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
