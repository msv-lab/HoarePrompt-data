Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is a list of `n` elements, each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.**

The code initializes `total_costs` as an empty list. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `total_costs` being an empty list.
