Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is a list of `n` elements, each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is not yet defined.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `costs` where each element is the result of calling `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`. The values of `rows`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `total_costs` remain unchanged, but `costs` is now defined and populated with the results of the function calls.
