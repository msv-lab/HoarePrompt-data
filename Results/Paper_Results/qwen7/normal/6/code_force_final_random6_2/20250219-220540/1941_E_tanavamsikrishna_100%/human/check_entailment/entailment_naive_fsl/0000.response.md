Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for building bridges and calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Support Placement**: The `func_1` function attempts to place supports in a way that does not guarantee the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. For example, consider the following row of depths:
   ```
   0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
   ```
   According to the problem description, the supports should be placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`. However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint. For instance, if `d = 4`, the function might place supports in positions that violate this rule.

2. **Heap Usage Misunderstanding**: The use of a min-heap in `func_1` is intended to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a certain point. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The while loop inside the for loop is not correctly managing the heap to ensure the distance constraint is met. This results in incorrect placement of supports and thus incorrect cost calculations.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific example:
- Given `d = 4`, the row `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]`, and the function should place supports in such a way that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most 4. The correct placement would be at positions `(1, 1)`, `(1, 5)`, and possibly others, ensuring the distance constraint is met. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

Since the program does not correctly handle the placement of supports and does not meet the problem's constraints, the program is incorrect.
