Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The only variable here is `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `h` is an integer from the input split by ':' and its value is either greater than 12 or equal to 12.
   - `m` is an integer from the input split by '.'.
   - `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `n`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than 0 and decremented by 1, so it must be greater than -1 but less than or equal to the original value of `n`.
- `h` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `day` remains unchanged.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0 initially, after decrementing by 1, `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer from the input split by ':' and its value is either greater than 12 or equal to 12, `m` is an integer from the input split by '.', and `day` is either 'PM' or 'AM'.**
