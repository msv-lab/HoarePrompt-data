Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `day` is initialized to `'AM'`.
   - The number of test cases `n` is read from the input.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads a time string in the format `hh:mm`.
   - It splits the string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`), converting them to integers.

3. **Convert 24-Hour Format to 12-Hour Format**:
   - If `h` is 0, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to `'AM'`. This correctly handles midnight (00:00).
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This correctly handles times after 12:00 PM.
   - Otherwise, it sets `day` to `'PM'`. However, this is incorrect because it doesn't handle the transition between 12:00 PM and 12:00 AM properly.
   - Additionally, setting `day` to `'AM'` when `h` is 12 is incorrect because 12:00 PM should remain `'PM'`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the time in the 12-hour format followed by the `day`.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for determining whether it is `'AM'` or `'PM'` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if h == 12: day = 'AM'` is incorrect.
- The correct logic should be:
  - If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to `'AM'`.
  - If `h` is 12, set `day` to `'PM'`.
  - If `h` is greater than 12, subtract 12 from `h` and set `day` to `'PM'`.
  - Otherwise, set `day` to `'AM'`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h -= 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in determining the 12-hour format. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
