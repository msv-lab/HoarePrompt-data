Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer from the input split by ':', `m` is an integer from the input split by ':'**

The code splits the input string by the colon (`:`) character and converts the resulting strings into integers, assigning them to `h` and `m`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
