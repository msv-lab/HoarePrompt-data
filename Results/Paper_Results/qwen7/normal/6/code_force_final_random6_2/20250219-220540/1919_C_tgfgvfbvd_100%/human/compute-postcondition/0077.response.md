Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`. If the element at index `x` in list `l` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains equal to the original value of `a`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1, and `a` is updated to the element at index `x` in list `l`, while `b` remains equal to the original value of `a`.
