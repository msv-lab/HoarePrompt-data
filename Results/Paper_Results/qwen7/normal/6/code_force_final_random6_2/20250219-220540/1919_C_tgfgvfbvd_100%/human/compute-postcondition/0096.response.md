Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, `b` is now equal to `l[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. Given that `x` is 2, `b` is now equal to `l[2]`. The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, and the relationship between `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
