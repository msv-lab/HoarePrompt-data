Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 4` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is equal to either `l[x+1]` or `l[x]` depending on the condition, `b` is equal to either `l[x]` or `l[x+1]` depending on the condition, and `c` is 1 if either `l[x+1]` or `l[x]` is greater than `b`, otherwise `c` remains 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `c` is 1; otherwise, `c` is 2.
