Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `l[0]`, `b` is equal to positive infinity, `c` is 1, `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c` is 0, so after executing `c += 1`, `c` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
