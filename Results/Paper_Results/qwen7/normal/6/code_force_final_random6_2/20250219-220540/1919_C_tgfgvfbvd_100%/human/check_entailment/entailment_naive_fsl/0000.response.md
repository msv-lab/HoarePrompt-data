Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find the minimum number of splits needed to ensure that each subsequence is sorted in non-decreasing order, but this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution for the given problem.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
4
1 2 3 4
3
1 3 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
0
```

This is incorrect because for the second test case, the optimal split would be `s = [1]` and `t = [3, 2]`, which results in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1`. The program incorrectly counts the penalty as `0`.

The program's logic does not account for the optimal way to split the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty. It instead tries to find the minimum number of splits needed to ensure each subsequence is sorted, which is not equivalent to minimizing the penalty as defined in the problem statement.
