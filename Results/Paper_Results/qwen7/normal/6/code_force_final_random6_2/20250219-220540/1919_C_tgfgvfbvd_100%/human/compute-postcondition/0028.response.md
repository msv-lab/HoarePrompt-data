Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to positive infinity, `b` is equal to `a` (which is positive infinity), `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 1.**

Explanation: The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to positive infinity. After swapping, `a` becomes positive infinity and `b` becomes `a`, which is also positive infinity. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `c`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
