Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` and the condition `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `initial_iterations - 2` is the number of remaining iterations.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `a` is now equal to `l[x]`.
   - `b` is equal to `a`.
   - `c` is 1 if `l[x]` is greater than `b` (which is `a`), otherwise `c` remains 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `x` in the range of `n`. This means `x` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `x` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `x` will be the previous value of `x` plus 1.
   - The number of remaining iterations will decrease by 1.
   - The value of `a` will be updated to `l[x]` where `x` is the new value.
   - The value of `b` will be updated to `a`.
   - The value of `c` will be updated based on the comparison between `l[x]` and `b`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The number of remaining iterations will be `initial_iterations - 3` because one more iteration will be performed.
   - `x` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `x` will be the previous value of `x` + 1.
   - `a` will be updated to `l[x]` where `x` is the new value.
   - `b` will be updated to `a`.
   - `c` will be updated based on the comparison between `l[x]` and `b`.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`initial_iterations - 3` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is now equal to `l[x+1]`, `b` is equal to `a`, and `c` is 1 if `l[x+1]` is greater than `b` (which is `a`), otherwise `c` remains 0.**
