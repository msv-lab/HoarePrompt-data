Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value. Since `t` was between 2 and 500, after decrementing it will still be within the same range but now it will be one less than its previous value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` is now one less than its previous value, still within the range of 2 to 500.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
