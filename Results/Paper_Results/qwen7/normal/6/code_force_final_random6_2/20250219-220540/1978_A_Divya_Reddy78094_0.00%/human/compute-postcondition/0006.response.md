The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, but since `_` is a dummy variable used for iteration, it does not affect the loop condition. The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was between 1 and 500 at the end of the previous iteration, decrementing `t` by 1 will still keep it greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
