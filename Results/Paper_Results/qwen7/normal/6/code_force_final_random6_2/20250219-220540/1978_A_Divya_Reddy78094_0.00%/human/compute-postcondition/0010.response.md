Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

We need to determine the output of the statement `print(nums[0] + nums[1])`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Since `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, the first element (`nums[0]`) is the largest integer in the list, and the second element (`nums[1]`) is the second largest integer in the list.
2. The expression `nums[0] + nums[1]` adds the largest and second largest integers from the list.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the two largest numbers in the `nums` list.

Output: **the sum of the two largest numbers in the `nums` list**
