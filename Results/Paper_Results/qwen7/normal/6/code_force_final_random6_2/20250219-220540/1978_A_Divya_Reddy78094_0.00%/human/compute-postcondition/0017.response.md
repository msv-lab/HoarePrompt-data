Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting.

This output state describes the situation after the loop has executed all its iterations. Since the loop runs `t` times and `t` starts from 1 and can go down to 497 (after 497 iterations, `t` would become 0, which is out of the allowed range of 1 to 500), `t` will be reduced by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 1. The variable `n` and the list `nums` will retain their last updated states after the final iteration of the loop, which is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
