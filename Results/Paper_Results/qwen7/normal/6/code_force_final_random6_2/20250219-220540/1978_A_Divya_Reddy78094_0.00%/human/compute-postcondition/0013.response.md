Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial state.
