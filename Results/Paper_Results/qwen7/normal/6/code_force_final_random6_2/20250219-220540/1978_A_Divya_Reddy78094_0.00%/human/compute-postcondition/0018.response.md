Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting.

This output state occurs because the loop runs `t` times, and since `t` ranges from 1 to 500 initially, after running the loop 500 times, `t` will be reduced by 500 - 3 = 497. The values of `n` and the list `nums` remain as they are after each iteration of the loop, with `n` being an input integer and `nums` being a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting.
