Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles such that each pile contains at least one book and Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.
- The provided solution sorts the list of page counts in descending order and then prints the sum of the pages of the two books with the most pages. This approach works because it ensures that the two largest values are placed in different piles, maximizing the total number of pages read.
- The solution correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually.
- The sorting step ensures that the two largest values are always chosen, which aligns with the requirement to maximize the total number of pages read.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
