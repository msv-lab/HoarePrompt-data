Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 499.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. This means the largest integer is at index 0, the second largest at index 1, and so on.
2. The expression `nums[0] + nums[1]` adds the two largest integers in the list.

Since the exact values of `nums` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements in the list.

Output: **the sum of the two largest integers in the list nums**
