You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1

    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting.
    #
    #This output state occurs because the loop runs `t` times, and since `t` ranges from 1 to 500 initially, after running the loop 500 times, `t` will be reduced by 500 - 3 = 497. The values of `n` and the list `nums` remain as they are after each iteration of the loop, with `n` being an input integer and `nums` being a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the pages of each book stored in `nums`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of book pages in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`.

3. **Pile Division and Reading**:
   - After sorting, the program takes the first two largest numbers from the sorted list (`nums[0]` and `nums[1]`).
   - It prints the sum of these two numbers, which represents the maximum number of pages Alice can read by putting the two largest books in different piles.

### Problem Description Analysis

- The goal is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the largest book from each pile.
- The optimal strategy is to place the two largest books in different piles because this ensures that the sum of the largest books from each pile is maximized.

### Verification

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum number of pages Alice can read. Here’s why:

- Sorting the list in descending order ensures that the two largest books are at the beginning of the list.
- Taking the sum of the first two elements after sorting guarantees that we are considering the two largest books, which are placed in different piles.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is correct.
