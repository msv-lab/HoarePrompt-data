Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).

3. **Adjust States for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Therefore, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`.

### Final State:

- `t` is now `t - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `nums` remains unchanged.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
