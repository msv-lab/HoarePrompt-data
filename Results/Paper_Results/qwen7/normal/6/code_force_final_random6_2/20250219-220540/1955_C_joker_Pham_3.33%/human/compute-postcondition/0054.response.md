Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is equal to \(0\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2, and the current value of `a[r]` is now less than the current value of `a[l]` by the amount of `a[r]`. Additionally, the current value of `a[l]` is 0.
