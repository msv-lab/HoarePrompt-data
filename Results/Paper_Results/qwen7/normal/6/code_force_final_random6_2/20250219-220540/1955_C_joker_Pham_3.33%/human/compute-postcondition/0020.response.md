Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\) reduced by \(2 \times a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0 or 1, and the current value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the current value of `a[r]`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by twice the value of `a[l]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` and `l` equals `r`, the condition for `a[l]` being less than or equal to `a[r]` is still satisfied.
