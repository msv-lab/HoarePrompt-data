Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if `a[r] < a[l]`, then `a[r]` is adjusted such that it is less than twice the current value of `a[l]` by the amount of `a[r]` if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] \times 2`. Otherwise, `sunks` is set to 1 and `a[r]` is set to \((k + 1) / 2\) if `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, and `l` is updated to `r` + 1, `r` is set to `n - 2`, and `sunks` is set to either 2, 3, or 4. If `a[r] >= a[l]`, then `sunks` remains either 0, 1, or 2.**
