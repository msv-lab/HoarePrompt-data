Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2] - 2 * a[l]\) or \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[l]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `r` is `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, or 9. If `k >= a[l] * 2`, then `a[n-3]` is decreased by `a[n-1]` if `a[r]` is not zero, and `sunks` is either 6, 7, 7, or 9. Otherwise, if `a[l] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is either 5, 6, 7, 7, or 8. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to `sunks`.
