Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 \cdot a[n]\) or 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is either `n + 1` or `n`, `r` is either `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 3, 4, 5, or 6, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is 4. Otherwise, nothing specific changes regarding `sunks`.**
