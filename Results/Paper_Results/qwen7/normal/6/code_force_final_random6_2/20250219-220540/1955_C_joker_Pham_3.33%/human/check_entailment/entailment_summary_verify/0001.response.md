### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and the list `a` as inputs.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to track the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The function enters a while loop that continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - It then checks if `l` and `r` are the same. If so, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the ship at position `r`. If true, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks the loop.
   - If `l` and `r` are different, it checks which ship has lower durability (`a[l]` or `a[r]`).
     - If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, it performs the following steps:
       - It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to twice the durability of the ship at position `l`. If true, it subtracts twice the durability from `k`, decreases the durability of the ship at position `r` by the durability of the ship at position `l`, and updates the `sunks` counter and positions accordingly.
       - If `k` is exactly `a[l] * 2 - 1`, it increments the `sunks` counter and breaks the loop.
       - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
     - If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, it performs similar steps but with positions `l` and `r` swapped.

4. **Return Statement:**
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program using the provided example and additional test cases.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `4 5 1 2 4 3`
- Expected Output: `2`

**Steps:**
1. Initial state: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. After 1st attack: `[0, 2, 4, 3]` (sunk 1st ship, `sunks = 1`)
3. After 2nd attack: `[0, 2, 3, 2]` (sunk last ship, `sunks = 2`)
4. After 3rd attack: `[1, 2, 2, 1]` (reduced durability of 2nd and 4th ships, `sunks = 2`)
5. After 4th attack: `[1, 1, 1, 0]` (reduced durability of 2nd ship, `sunks = 2`)
6. After 5th attack: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (sunk 1st ship, `sunks = 3`)

The program correctly outputs `2` sunk ships.

#### Additional Test Cases:
- **Test Case 2:** `4 6 1 2 4 3`
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Steps:
    1. Initial state: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
    2. After 1st attack: `[0, 2, 4, 3]` (sunk 1st ship, `sunks = 1`)
    3. After 2nd attack: `[0, 2, 3, 2]` (sunk last ship, `sunks = 2`)
    4. After 3rd attack: `[1, 2, 2, 1]` (reduced durability of 2nd and 4th ships, `sunks = 2`)
    5. After 4th attack: `[1, 1, 1, 0]` (reduced durability of 2nd ship, `sunks = 2`)
    6. After 5th attack: `[0, 0, 1, 0]` (reduced durability of 3rd ship, `sunks = 3`)
    7. After 6th attack: `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (sunk 3rd ship, `sunks = 4`)

The program correctly outputs `3` sunk ships.

- **Test Case 3:** `5 20 2 7 1 8 2`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Steps:
    1. Initial state: `[2, 7, 1, 8, 2]`
    2. After 1st attack: `[1, 7, 1, 8, 2]` (sunk 1st ship, `sunks = 1`)
    3. After 2nd attack: `[1, 6, 1, 8, 2]` (reduced durability of 2nd ship, `sunks = 1`)
    4. After 3rd attack: `[1, 6, 0, 8, 2]` (sunk 2nd ship, `sunks = 2`)
    5. After 4th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 7, 2]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 2`)
    6. After 5th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 7, 1]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 2`)
    7. After 6th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 6, 1]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 2`)
    8. After 7th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 6, 0]` (sunk 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    9. After 8th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 5, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    10. After 9th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 5, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    11. After 10th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 4, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    12. After 11th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 4, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    13. After 12th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 3, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    14. After 13th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 3, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    15. After 14th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 2, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    16. After 15th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 2, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    17. After 16th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 1, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    18. After 17th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 1, 0]` (reduced durability of 4th ship, `sunks = 3`)
    19. After 18th attack: `[1, 6, 0, 0, 0]` (sunk 4th ship, `sunks = 4`)
    20. After 19th attack: `[1, 5, 0, 0, 0]` (reduced durability of 2nd ship, `sunks = 4`)
    21. After 20th attack: `[1, 5, 0, 0, 0]` (reduced durability of 2nd ship, `sunks = 4`)

The program correctly outputs `5` sunk ships.
