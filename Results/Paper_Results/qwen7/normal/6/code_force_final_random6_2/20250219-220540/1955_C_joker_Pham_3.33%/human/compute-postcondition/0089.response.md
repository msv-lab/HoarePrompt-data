Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is `-2 * a[n]`, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 5 or 6, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l-1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` becomes `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
