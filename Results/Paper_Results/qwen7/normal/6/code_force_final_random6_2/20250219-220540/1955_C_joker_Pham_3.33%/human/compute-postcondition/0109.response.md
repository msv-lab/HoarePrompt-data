Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 \cdot a[n]\) or 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is either `n + 1` or `n`, `r` is either `n - 3` or `n - 2`, `sunks` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged from their initial states.
