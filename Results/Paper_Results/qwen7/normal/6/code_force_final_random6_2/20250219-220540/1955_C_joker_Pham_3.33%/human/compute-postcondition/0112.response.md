Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2]\) or \(-2 * a[n]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n - 3`, `sunks` is either 3, 4, 5, or 6. If `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`. If `k >= a[r] * 2` does not hold and `a[r] * 2 - 1 == k`, then `sunks` is set to 4. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to `sunks`.
