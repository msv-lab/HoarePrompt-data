Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is 0, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
