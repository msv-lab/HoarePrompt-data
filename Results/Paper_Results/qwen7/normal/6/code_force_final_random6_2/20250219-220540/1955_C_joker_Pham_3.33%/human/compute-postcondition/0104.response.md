Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is either \(-2 * a[n] - 2 * a[n-2]\) or \(-2 * a[n]\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is `n + 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 4, 5, or 6, `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`. If `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is updated to `n + 1` and `r` is updated to `n - 2`.**
