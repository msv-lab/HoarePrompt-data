The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l <= r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l <= r` must be true.

Given that `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `l <= r` will always be true as long as `n` is at least 1 (which it is, since `n` is a positive integer).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the states of `l` and `r`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is 0**
