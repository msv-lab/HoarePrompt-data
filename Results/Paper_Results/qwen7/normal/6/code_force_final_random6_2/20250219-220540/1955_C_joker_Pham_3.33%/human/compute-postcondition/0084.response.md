Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is `-2 * a[n]`, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) with length `n`, `l` must be equal to `n`, `r` must be `n - 2`, `sunks` is either 3 or 4, `a[r]` is `a[r] - a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` subtracts the value of `a[l]` from `a[r]`. Given that `l` is equal to `n` and `r` is equal to `n - 2`, the value of `a[r]` (which is `a[n-2]`) is updated to `a[n-2] - a[n]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
