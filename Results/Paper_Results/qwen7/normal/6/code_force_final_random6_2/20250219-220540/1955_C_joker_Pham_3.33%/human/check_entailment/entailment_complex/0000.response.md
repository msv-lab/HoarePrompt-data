Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program correctly reads the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` as specified in the problem statement.
2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` with the appropriate arguments, which is the correct approach.
3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the attacks by the Kraken, reducing the durability of the ships and counting the number of sunk ships (`sunks`).
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, updating the durability and counting the sunk ships appropriately.
   - The function correctly breaks out of the loop when `k` becomes zero or when there are no more ships to attack.
   - The function returns the correct count of sunk ships, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the detailed analysis, the function logic appears to be correct and matches the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
