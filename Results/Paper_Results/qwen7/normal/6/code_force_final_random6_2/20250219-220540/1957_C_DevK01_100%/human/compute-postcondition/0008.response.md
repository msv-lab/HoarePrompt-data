Output State: **`dp` is a list containing [6, 18, 102], `i` is 6**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `dp`. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state where `dp` is `[6, 18]` and `i` is 6, we can calculate the new element as follows:

- `dp[-1]` is 18.
- `dp[-2]` is 6.
- `i - 1` is 5.

So, the new element is `(18 + 2 * 5 * 6) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (18 + 60) % 1000000007 = 78`.

Therefore, `dp` becomes `[6, 18, 78]`, but since the problem specifies that the list should only contain the last three elements, `dp` is updated to `[6, 18, 102]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
