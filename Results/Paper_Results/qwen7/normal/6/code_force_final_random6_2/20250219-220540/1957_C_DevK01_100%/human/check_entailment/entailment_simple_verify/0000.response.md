### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move consists of placing a white rook at position \((r, c)\) and the computer placing a black rook at position \((c, r)\).
- The key constraint is that no two rooks can attack each other, meaning they cannot be in the same row or column.
- The program updates `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not. If the move is not mirrored, `n` is decreased by 2; otherwise, `n` is decreased by 1.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       L = list(map(int, input().split()))
       (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
   ```
   This part reads the number of test cases and initializes \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Processing Moves:**
   ```python
   for j in range(k):
       L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
       (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
       if a != b:
           n -= 2
       else:
           n -= 1
   ```
   This loop processes each of the \( k \) moves. If the move is not mirrored (\( a \neq b \)), `n` is decreased by 2. If the move is mirrored (\( a = b \)), `n` is decreased by 1.

3. **Calling Function:**
   ```python
   print(func_1(n))
   ```
   This calls the function `func_1` with the updated value of `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       dp = [1, 1]
       for i in range(2, n + 1):
           dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
           dp.pop(0)
       return dp[-1]
   ```
   This function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible configurations. The recurrence relation used is:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]
   The base cases are \( dp[0] = 1 \) and \( dp[1] = 1 \).

#### Verification:
- **Base Cases:**
  - For \( n = 0 \), there is only 1 configuration (no rooks).
  - For \( n = 1 \), there is only 1 configuration (one rook in the only available cell).

- **Recurrence Relation:**
  - The recurrence relation ensures that the number of configurations is correctly computed by considering the placement of rooks in each row and column.

- **Test Case:**
  - Consider the test case \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 1 \) with the move \( (1, 2) \).
    - Initial \( n = 4 \).
    - Move \( (1, 2) \) is not mirrored, so \( n \) is decreased by 2, resulting in \( n = 2 \).
    - The function `func_1(2)` should return the correct number of configurations for a \( 2 \times 2 \) board, which is 3.

Given the annotations and the explanation in the original assessment, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for updating `n` and the dynamic programming approach in `func_1`. The original assessment seems to have misunderstood the problem constraints and the correctness of the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given annotations.
