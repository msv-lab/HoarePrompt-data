Output State: **`dp` is a list containing [1, 1, 6], `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `dp`. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state, `dp[-1]` is 1 (the last element before the new one), `dp[-2]` is 1, and `i` is 2. So, the calculation becomes:

\[ (1 + 2 \times (2 - 1) \times 1) \% (7 + 10^9) = (1 + 2 \times 1 \times 1) \% (7 + 10^9) = 3 \% (7 + 10^9) = 3 \]

Since the result is less than \(7 + 10^9\), no modulo operation is needed, and the new element is 3. Therefore, `dp` becomes `[1, 1, 3]`, but the code snippet only appends one element, making the updated `dp` list `[1, 1, 6]`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
