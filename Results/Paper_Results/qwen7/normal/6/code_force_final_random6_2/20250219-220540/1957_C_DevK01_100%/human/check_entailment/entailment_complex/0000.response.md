### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of valid moves. Each move by the player is mirrored by the computer, and the goal is to compute the number of unique configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then iterates through the moves, reducing \( n \) by 1 for each move unless the move is along the diagonal (where \( a = b \)), in which case it reduces \( n \) by 1 instead of 2.
   - After processing all moves, it calls the function `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of configurations.
   - It initializes `dp` with `[1, 1]` and iteratively updates it based on the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`.
   - The final value returned is the second element of the `dp` list, which corresponds to the number of configurations for the given \( n \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct and follows the dynamic programming approach to count configurations.
   - The reduction of \( n \) based on the moves is also correctly implemented.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:
