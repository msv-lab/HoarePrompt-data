You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. It calculates a sequence using a dynamic programming approach and returns the last element of the resulting list. The sequence is generated by iterating from 2 to `n`, where each new element is computed based on the previous two elements modulo 10^9 + 7. The function ultimately returns the second element of the final list, which is 10302 for the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: 
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Size of the chessboard `n` and number of moves already played `k`.
     - `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made by the player.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of possible final configurations of the board after all moves are made, considering the mirroring rule.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Constraints**:
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
   - Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

### Provided Solution Analysis
1. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then processes `k` moves.
   - For each move, it checks if the row and column are the same (`a == b`). If they are not the same, it reduces the effective size of the board by 2 (since both positions are occupied). If they are the same, it reduces the board size by 1.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks without attacking each other.
   - The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.
   - For each subsequent value, it uses the recurrence relation: \(dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Verification
1. **Board Reduction Logic**:
   - The logic to reduce the board size based on the moves is correct. If a move is mirrored, it effectively reduces the board size by 2. If not, it reduces by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the number of configurations using dynamic programming. The recurrence relation used is appropriate for this problem.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct. It correctly handles the reduction of the board size based on the moves and computes the number of configurations using dynamic programming.
