Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(lst)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(lst)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is 3.
   - `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 9.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first one plus 9.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < len(lst)`, the next value of `i` will be 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - The length of the list `lst` remains unchanged.
   
5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `len(lst)` remains the same (since it is a function of the list itself, not a variable that changes within the loop).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst` plus 9, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the first one plus 9**.
