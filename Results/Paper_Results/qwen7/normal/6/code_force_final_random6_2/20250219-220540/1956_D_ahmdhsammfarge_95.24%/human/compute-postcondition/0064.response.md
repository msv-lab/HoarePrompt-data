Output State: **`over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`.**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, `over_sum` now holds the value of `sm`, while `r` and `l` retain their original values `i` and `j`, respectively.
