Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `ops` is a list containing `[r + 1, l + 1]` twice, and `n` remains unchanged. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function also does nothing.
