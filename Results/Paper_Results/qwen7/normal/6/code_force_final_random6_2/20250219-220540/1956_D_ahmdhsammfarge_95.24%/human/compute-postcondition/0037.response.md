Output State: **`j` is 3, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[4:]) + (3 - i + 1), `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `sm` to the variable `over_sum`. Since `sm` is defined as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[4:]) + (3 - i + 1)`, `over_sum` will also hold this value. All other variables (`j`, `lst`, `sm`, `r`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
