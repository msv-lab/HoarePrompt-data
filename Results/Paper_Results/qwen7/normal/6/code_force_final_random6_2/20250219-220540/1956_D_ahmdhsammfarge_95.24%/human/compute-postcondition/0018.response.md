Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(i + 1, len(lst))`.

2. **Determine the current values of the loop variables**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`.
   - `j` starts from `i + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`.
   - Currently, `j` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 (since `j` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `lst` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `over_sum` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `over_sum` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
