The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `lst` by replacing the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each set to `l - r + 1`. Additionally, it appends certain operations to the `ops` list and calls another function `func_2` with the same parameters. The function ultimately returns the modified list `lst`.
