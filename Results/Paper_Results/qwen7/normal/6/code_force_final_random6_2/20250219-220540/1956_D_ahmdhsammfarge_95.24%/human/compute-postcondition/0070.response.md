Output State: **The program returns the indices `r` and `l` which produce the maximum value of `sm`, where `sm` is defined as the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the program has determined the indices `l` and `r` that maximize the expression `sum(lst[:l]) + sum(lst[r+1:]) + (r - l + 1)**2`, and these indices are returned.
