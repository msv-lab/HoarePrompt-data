Output State: **`sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j + 1` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j + 1` and `i`, `r` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, and `sm` is updated to the new calculated value.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j + 1` in the list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j + 1` and `i`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
