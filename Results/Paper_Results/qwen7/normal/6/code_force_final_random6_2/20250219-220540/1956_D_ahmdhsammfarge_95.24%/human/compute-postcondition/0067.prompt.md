Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` remains as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` from index `i` to the second last element plus 1, `r` is `i`, and `l` is the last index of `lst`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sm` is the sum of the elements before index `i` and after index `j` in list `lst`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `i` and `l` is set to `j`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, there is no change to `r` and `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sm` is updated to the new calculated value. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` equals `sm` and `r` equals `[i, j]`. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sm` is updated to the new calculated value which is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` equals `sm`, `r` equals `i`, and `l` equals `j`. Otherwise, the values of `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
