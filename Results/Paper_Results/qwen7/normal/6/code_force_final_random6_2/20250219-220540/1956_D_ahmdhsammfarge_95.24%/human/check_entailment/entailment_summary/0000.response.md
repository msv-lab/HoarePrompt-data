### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of that subarray. The operations are limited to 5 * 10^5.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function finds the optimal subarray to modify to maximize the sum. It calculates the sum of elements before `l` and after `r` plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`. This logic seems to be flawed because the MEX operation should be considered directly rather than the sum plus squared distance.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function appears to be a recursive function that generates a sequence of operations but doesn't seem to directly relate to the MEX operation or sum maximization.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function performs the actual modification of the array and appends operations to the list. However, it doesn't correctly implement the MEX operation or the logic to maximize the sum.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the script tries to find the first occurrence of 0 in the array and replaces it with 1, appending the operation. If there's no 0, it doesn't perform any operations.
   - The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` do not seem to align with the problem requirements for finding and modifying the subarray with the MEX value.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array using the MEX operation.
   - The main logic does not ensure that the MEX operation is applied optimally to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
