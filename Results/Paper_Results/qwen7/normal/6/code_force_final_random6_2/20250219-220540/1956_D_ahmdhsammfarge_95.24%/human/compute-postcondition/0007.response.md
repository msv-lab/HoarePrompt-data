Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]].**

Explanation: The code appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` originally contained `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`, after appending, it becomes `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
