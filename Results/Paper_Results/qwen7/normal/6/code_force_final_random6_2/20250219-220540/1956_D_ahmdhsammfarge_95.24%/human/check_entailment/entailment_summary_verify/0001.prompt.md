You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `lst` by replacing the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each set to `l - r + 1`. Additionally, it appends certain operations to the `ops` list and calls another function `func_2` with the same parameters. The function ultimately returns the modified list `lst`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements of an array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times. The operation involves choosing a subarray and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray.

### Provided Functions
1. **func_1(lst):**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates the sum of the subarray plus the contribution from the remaining parts of the array, and keeps track of the best subarray found.
   - However, the logic here is flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX and the new sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.

2. **func_2(r, l, ops: list):**
   - This function recursively constructs a sequence of operations.
   - It seems to be intended to build a sequence of operations to transform the array, but it doesn't actually compute the MEX or update the array values.

3. **func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):**
   - This function is supposed to perform the actual operation on the subarray and record the operation.
   - It incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX value.
   - It also includes redundant operations and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is fundamentally flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value and the resulting sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is intended to build a sequence of operations but does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum sum.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray rather than the MEX value, and it includes redundant operations.

Given these issues, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
