Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to find the indices `l` and `r` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is defined as the sum of all elements in the list before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`. However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, the nested loops iterate over all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` to find the maximum value of `sm`. But the calculation of `sm` is incorrect because it incorrectly sums elements before and after the indices `i` and `j` without considering the actual subarray from `i` to `j`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to recursively append operations to the list `ops`. However, the function does not have a clear purpose or logic. It seems to be designed to create a sequence of operations but does not seem to be correctly implemented. The function does not return any value and its behavior is unclear.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is supposed to modify the list `lst` by setting the elements from index `r` to `l` to a value derived from the length of the subarray. However, the function logic is also flawed. It first appends operations to `ops` and then checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends another operation. Then it calls `func_2` and appends another operation. Finally, it sets the elements from index `r` to `l` to the length of the subarray. This function does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the overall program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The functions do not properly calculate the MEX or maximize the sum of the array as required.

Correctness: **False**
