Output State: The variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x` after the loop has executed all its iterations, because `i` is initialized to 3 and incremented within the loop but does not exit the loop until `i` equals `x`. The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `s` will be equal to `x * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)` after the loop has executed all its iterations. This is because `s` is updated in each iteration of the loop by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value, and this update happens `x` times.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the final value of `x`, `x` itself will remain unchanged, and `s` will be equal to `x` times the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`, repeated `x` times.
