Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 8, `i` is 3.

Explanation: The loop increments `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration. Starting from `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 2. After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4. After the third iteration, `s` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth (final) iteration, `s` will be \(6 + 6 // (k - 1) + 1\). Given the initial conditions and the nature of the loop, `s` will be 8 after all iterations. The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, so after 3 iterations, it will be 3. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
