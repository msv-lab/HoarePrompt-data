Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `x` is `new_x`, `s` is 3 * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)**

Explanation: The initial value of `s` is given by the expression `2 * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`. After executing the line `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, the value of `s` is updated to its original value plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `s` becomes `3 * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
