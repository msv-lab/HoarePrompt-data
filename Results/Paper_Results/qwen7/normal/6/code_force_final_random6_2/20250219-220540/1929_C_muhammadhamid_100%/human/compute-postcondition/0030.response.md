Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `x` is `new_x`, `s` is `2 * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state where `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, the new value of `s` becomes `2 * (s + s // (k - 1) + 1)`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
