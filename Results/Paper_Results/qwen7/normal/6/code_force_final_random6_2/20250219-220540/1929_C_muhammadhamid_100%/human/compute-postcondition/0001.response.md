Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, and now `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

This means that the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` have been updated based on the input provided, while the conditions for `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain valid. The specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are now determined by the input, but their ranges are still respected.
