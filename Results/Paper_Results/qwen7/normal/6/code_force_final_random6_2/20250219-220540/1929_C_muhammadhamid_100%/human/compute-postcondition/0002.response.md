Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is 1.**

The code initializes `s` to 1, which does not affect the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `s` to 1.
