Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `s` as the sum of Sasha's coins after `x` consecutive losses, but it does not account for the fact that Sasha needs to be able to win back his coins after losing. 

To illustrate, consider the test case `(k=2, x=1, a=1)`. According to the problem description, Sasha should be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants, but the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" because it calculates `s` as `1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`, which is greater than `a = 1`. However, this calculation does not reflect the actual strategy needed to ensure Sasha can always win back his coins after a loss.

A correct approach would involve a strategy that ensures Sasha can always recover from a loss and continue betting until he reaches the desired number of coins. The current implementation fails to capture this essential aspect of the problem.
