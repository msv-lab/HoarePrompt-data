The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 48 (since `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `t` being decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 48, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**
