Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50 remains unchanged.
