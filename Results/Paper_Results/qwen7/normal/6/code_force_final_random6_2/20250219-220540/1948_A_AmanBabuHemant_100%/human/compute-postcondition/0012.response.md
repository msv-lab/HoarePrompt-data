Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided:
- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, and the length of `s` is 200 or more.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` do not affect this print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string 'NO'.
