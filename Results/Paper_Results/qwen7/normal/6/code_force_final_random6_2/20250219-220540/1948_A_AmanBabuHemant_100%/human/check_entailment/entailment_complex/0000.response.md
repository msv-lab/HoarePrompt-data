Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases \( t \) and then processing each test case individually.
- For each test case, the function checks if \( n \) is odd or even.
  - If \( n \) is odd, it correctly prints 'NO', as an odd number of special characters cannot be formed with the given rules.
  - If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string \( s \) using 'AAB' repeated \( n // 2 \) times.
    - This approach ensures that every character except the first and last will have exactly one neighbor that is different, making them special.
    - The constructed string \( s \) will always have a length of \( 3 \times (n // 2) = 1.5n \).
      - Since \( n \) is even, \( 1.5n \) will be an integer and less than or equal to 200 for \( n \leq 50 \).
- The function correctly handles the output format for both 'YES' and 'NO' cases.
- The function does not return any value but prints the results directly, which is acceptable for this problem.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
