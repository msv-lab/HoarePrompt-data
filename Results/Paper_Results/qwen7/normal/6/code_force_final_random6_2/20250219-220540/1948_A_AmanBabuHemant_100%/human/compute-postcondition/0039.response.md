Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the conditions specified for variables t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 50, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 50. The function checks the relationship between t and n and returns a corresponding value based on the conditions given.**

Note: Since the specific return values for different conditions are not provided, the description focuses on the parameter constraints and the general behavior of the function based on those constraints.
