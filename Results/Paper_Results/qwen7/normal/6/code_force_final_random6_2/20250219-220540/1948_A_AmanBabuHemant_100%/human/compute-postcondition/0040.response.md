Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) and then \( t \) integers \( n \). For each \( n \), it checks if \( n \) is odd or even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string \( s \) consisting of 'AAB' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of \( s \) is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by \( s \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
