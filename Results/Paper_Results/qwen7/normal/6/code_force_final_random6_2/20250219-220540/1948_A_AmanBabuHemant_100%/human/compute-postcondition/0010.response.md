Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is an even input integer.
- `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.
- The length of `s` is less than 200.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(s)` executes.

First, let's break down the value of `s`:
- `s` is constructed by repeating the string 'AAB' `n // 2` times.
- Since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer representing half of `n`.

For example, if `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`, and `s` would be 'AAB' repeated 3 times, resulting in 'AABAABAAB'.

Since the length of `s` is less than 200 and `n` is an even integer, the value of `n // 2` will be such that the total length of `s` does not exceed 200. This means `s` could be any valid string formed by repeating 'AAB' a certain number of times, but it will always be less than 200 characters long.

Therefore, the output will be the string `s`, which is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times**
