Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, `t` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `t` remains unchanged and `s` is a string consisting of 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times, with the length of `s` being less than 200 if the condition `len(s) < 200` is true; otherwise, the length of `s` is 200 or more.
