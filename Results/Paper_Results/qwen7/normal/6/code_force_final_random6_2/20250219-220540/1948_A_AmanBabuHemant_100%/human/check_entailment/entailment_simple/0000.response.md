Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character has exactly one neighbor different from itself.
4. If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that every character in the string (except the first and last) will have exactly one neighbor different from itself, making it a special character.
5. The constructed string `s` is checked to ensure its length does not exceed 200. If it does, the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `s`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n`. It produces the correct output for each test case as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
