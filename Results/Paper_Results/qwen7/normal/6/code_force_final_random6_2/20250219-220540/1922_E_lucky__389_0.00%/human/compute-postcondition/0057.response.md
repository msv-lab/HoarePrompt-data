Output State: `i` is 0, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 489, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10].

Explanation: After the first three iterations, the value of `i` can either be 0 or 10. If `i` is 0, the loop breaks immediately as it does not satisfy the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. Therefore, `i` remains 0, and no further iterations occur. The value of `mx` remains 10 because it was last updated to 10 during the third iteration, and `x` is reduced to 489 after the third iteration. The list `subseq_lens` contains [10, 10] because `i` was 10 twice in the previous iterations. If `i` is 10, the loop continues, but since `x` is now 489, the inner while loop's condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` will not be satisfied for any `i`, leading to the same final state as when `i` is 0.
