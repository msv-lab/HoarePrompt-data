Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The approach involves using the binary representation of \(X-1\) to determine the lengths of the subarrays that contribute to the total count of increasing subsequences.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the binary representation of \(X-1\).
   - Each bit in the binary representation of \(X-1\) corresponds to a segment in the array where the elements are repeated a certain number of times.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly calculates the binary representation of \(X-1\) and uses this to construct the required array.
   - It initializes `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of segments and `mx` to track the maximum segment length.
   - The while loop calculates the necessary segment lengths and updates `subseq_lens` accordingly.
   - After determining the segment lengths, the code constructs the array `ansv` by repeating each segment length the appropriate number of times.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the array and the array itself.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where \(X = 2\) correctly by returning an array of length 1 with a single element.
   - For other values of \(X\), the code constructs the array based on the binary representation of \(X-1\).

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for constructing the array based on the binary representation of \(X-1\) is sound.
   - The code correctly handles the edge case of \(X = 2\).
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be correct for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
