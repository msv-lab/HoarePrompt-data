Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `mx` is 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
   - `x` must be at least 1
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop condition involves `i` and `x`.
   - We need to ensure that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` holds true for the next iteration.

4. **Evaluate the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - Substituting `i = 1` into the loop condition: `2 ** (1 + 1) = 2 ** 2 = 4`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `4 <= x + 1`.

5. **Determine the required state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `x + 1` must be at least 4.
   - Since `x` must be at least 1, the smallest possible value for `x` that satisfies `4 <= x + 1` is `x = 3`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs adjustment is `x`, which must be at least 3.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 1, `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
