Output State: **`i` is 10, `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 479, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10]**.

Explanation: The code `x -= 2 ** i - 1` subtracts the value of \(2^{i} - 1\) from `x`. Given that `i` is 10, \(2^{10} - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023\). Therefore, `x` is updated to `489 - 1023 = 479`. All other variables remain unchanged.
