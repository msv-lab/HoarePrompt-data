Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Subsequence Length Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the lengths of the required increasing subsequences using a while loop. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed.
   - Specifically, the loop aims to find the largest power of 2 that fits into `x + 1` and subtracts the corresponding value from `x`. This is intended to build the sequence of subsequence lengths.
   - The current implementation does not handle the case where `x` becomes less than the next power of 2, causing an infinite loop or incorrect values being appended to `subseq_lens`.

3. **Array Construction**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed based on the calculated subsequence lengths. However, the logic to construct the array is not fully implemented, and the provided explanation is misleading.
   - The loop that appends `subseq_lens[i]` to `ansv` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the construction of the array based on the subsequence lengths.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself. However, the array is not correctly constructed, and the output format does not match the expected requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
