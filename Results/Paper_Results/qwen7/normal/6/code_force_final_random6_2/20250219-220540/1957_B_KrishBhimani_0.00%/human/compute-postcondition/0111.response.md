Output State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`, `n` is an integer from the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is an integer from the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.**

The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` converts the elements of the list `l1` into integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since the exact values of `l1` are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `k` are the first and second elements of `l1` converted to integers. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
