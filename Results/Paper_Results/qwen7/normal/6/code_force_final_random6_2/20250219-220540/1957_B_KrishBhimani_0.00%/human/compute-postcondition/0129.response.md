Output State: **`i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` must be non-zero**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains [0, 1]. After appending, `arr` becomes [0, 1, 2]. The values of `i`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `k` still must be non-zero.
