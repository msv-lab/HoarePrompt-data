Output State: **`i` is 16, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768], `ans` is an empty list [], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. Since no elements are appended to `ans` within the given code snippet, `ans` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `arr`, `c`, `k0`, `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`) retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
