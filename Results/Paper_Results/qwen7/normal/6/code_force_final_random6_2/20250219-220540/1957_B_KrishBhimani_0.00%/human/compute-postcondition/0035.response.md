`c` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `c` is 0, so after executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, `ans` is a list containing the value `-sum(ans)`, `c` is 1.
