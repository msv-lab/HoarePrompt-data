Output State: **`i` is 32, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. Since no operations are performed on `ans` within the given code snippet, `ans` remains unchanged. The loop condition is not provided, but based on the initial state and the explanation, the loop runs 32 times, appending the value of `i` (which starts at 32 and does not change) to `arr` when `k` is odd. After 32 iterations, `k` becomes 0, terminating the loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `arr`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain as described in the initial state.
