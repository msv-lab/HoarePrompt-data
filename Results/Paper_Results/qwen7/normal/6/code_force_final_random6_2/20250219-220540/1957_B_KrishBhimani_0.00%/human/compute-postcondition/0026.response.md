Output State: `i` is 32, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. Each iteration of the loop divides `k` by 2 using the right shift operation (`k = k >> 1`). The variable `i` increments by 1 with each iteration. Given that the loop executes 31 times (from `i=0` to `i=31`), `k` becomes 0 after the 31st iteration. During these iterations, whenever `k` is odd (i.e., `k & 1 == 1`), the value of `i` at that moment is appended to `arr`. Therefore, `arr` contains the values from 0 to 31.
