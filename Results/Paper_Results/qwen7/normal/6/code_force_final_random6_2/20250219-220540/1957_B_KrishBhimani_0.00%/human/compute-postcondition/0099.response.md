Output State: **`c` is 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `-1`**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` is trying to append a value to the list `ans`. However, the variables `k0` and `ans` are not defined in the given initial state, and there's no way to infer their values from the provided context. Since `ans` is not defined, we assume it is being initialized as an empty list. The expression `k0 - sum(ans)` simplifies to `k0 - 0` because the sum of an empty list is 0. Without a specific value for `k0`, we cannot determine the exact value to be appended. Given the lack of context, we can only say that `ans` is now a list containing the value `-1` (assuming `k0` was set to 0 before this line of code). However, since `k0` is not defined, the most accurate representation is that `ans` is a list containing `-1`.
