Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is greater than 0 and now equal to `k // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables.
