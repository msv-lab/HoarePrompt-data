Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `n` is an integer from the input, `l1` is updated with the input split, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` reads an input string, splits it into a list of strings (`l1`), and does not affect the other variables. The value of `n` is set to the integer representation of the first element of `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
