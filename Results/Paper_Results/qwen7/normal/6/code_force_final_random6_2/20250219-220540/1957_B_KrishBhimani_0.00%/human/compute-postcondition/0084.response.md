Output State: **`i` is 16, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768], `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends a new element to the list `ans`. However, the values of `k0` and `ans` before this operation are not specified in the initial state. Since no specific values for `k0` and `ans` are given, we cannot determine the exact value of the appended element. But we know that `ans` will now contain one more element, which is the result of `k0 - sum(ans)`. The other variables (`i`, `arr`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
