Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is now `k // 2`, `arr` is a list containing the value [0], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1, and the value of `k` is now even.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the bits of `k` one position to the right, which is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2. Since `k` was initially an odd number, after the operation, `k` becomes even. All other variables remain unchanged.
