Output State: **`i` is 0; `arr` is a list containing the value [0]; `c` is 2; `ans` is a list containing the value [1]; `k0` must be non-zero, and the current value of k is odd.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i`, which is 0, to the list `arr`. Since `i` remains unchanged and all other variables (`c`, `ans`, `k0`) are not affected by this operation, their states remain the same as the initial state.
