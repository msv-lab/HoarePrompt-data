Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in arr:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is 1
   - `i` is 32
   - `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`
   - `ans` is a list containing the values `[-32, 4294967296]`

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.
   - The current value of `i` is 32, which is the last element in the list `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the last element in `arr`, the next value of `i` will be the first element of the list `arr` (which is 0).
   - The list `arr` will be updated to exclude the current value of `i` (32).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`c` is 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`**
