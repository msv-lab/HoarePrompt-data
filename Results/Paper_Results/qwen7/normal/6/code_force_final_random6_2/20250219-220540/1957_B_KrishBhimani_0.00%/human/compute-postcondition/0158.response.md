Output State: **`c` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value `-k0`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` was initially `n-1`. After executing `c += 1`, `c` becomes `n`. The values of `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
