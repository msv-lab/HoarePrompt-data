Output State: **`i` is 16, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768], `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the only effect is that the program exits the current loop or conditional context. The values of the variables `i`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
