Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `t` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4] is still valid. The value of `n` is now known and is an integer within the specified range, but its specific value is not provided in the input, so it is described as "an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5."
