Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array `a` is considered beautiful. Based on these inputs, the function returns information about the beautiful array `a`.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value of `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines and returns some characteristic or property of the beautiful array `a` for each test case.
