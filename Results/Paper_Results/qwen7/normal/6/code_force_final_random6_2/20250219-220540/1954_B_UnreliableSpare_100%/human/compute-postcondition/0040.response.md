Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if the value at index `i` in `arr` equals `val`, or reset to 0 if it does not
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and 0

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop has completed all iterations from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to 0 (the start of the next iteration).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration, we need to reset `i` to 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop and is determined before the loop starts.
   - `cnt` and `ans` are updated inside the loop body based on the condition, but their values are not directly affected by the loop head.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` is reset to 0
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 1)
   - `cnt` and `ans` retain their values from the previous iteration

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` retains its value, `ans` retains its value**
