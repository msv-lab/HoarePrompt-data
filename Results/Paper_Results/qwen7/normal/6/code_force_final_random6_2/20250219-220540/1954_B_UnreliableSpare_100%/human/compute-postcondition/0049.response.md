Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 1
- `cnt` retains its final value after the last iteration
- `ans` is updated to the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`
- `flag` remains `False`
- The if condition evaluates to `True` as `flag` is `True`

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. Since no other variables or conditions affect this print statement, it will directly print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
