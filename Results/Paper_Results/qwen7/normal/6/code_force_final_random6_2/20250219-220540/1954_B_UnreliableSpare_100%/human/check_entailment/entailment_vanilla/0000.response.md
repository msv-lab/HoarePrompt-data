Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Check**: The `func_1` function checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. **Counting Operations**: The function iterates through the array to count the maximum number of consecutive identical elements. This is used to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the "beautiful" property.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, it correctly outputs `-1`.
   - For other cases, it calculates the minimum number of removals needed to ensure the array is no longer "beautiful". This is done by finding the longest sequence of identical elements and subtracting this length from the total array length minus one (since removing one element can potentially break the "beautiful" property).
5. **Output**: The function correctly outputs the minimum number of elements to remove or `-1` if it's impossible to break the "beautiful" property.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
