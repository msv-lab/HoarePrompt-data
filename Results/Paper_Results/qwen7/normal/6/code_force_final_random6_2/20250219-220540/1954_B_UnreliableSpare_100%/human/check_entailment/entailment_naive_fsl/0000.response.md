Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has alternating elements properly. For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program should output `1` because removing the element at index `2` (value `1`) will make the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful. However, the current implementation does not detect this scenario correctly. It checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements but does not account for the possibility of needing to remove elements to break the beauty condition.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify and count the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition. The current logic only counts consecutive occurrences of the same value and does not handle the general case where the array might have a pattern that requires removals to break the beauty condition.
