Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` is False**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the variable `flag` to `False`. Since the initial state already had `flag` as `False`, the value of `flag` remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
