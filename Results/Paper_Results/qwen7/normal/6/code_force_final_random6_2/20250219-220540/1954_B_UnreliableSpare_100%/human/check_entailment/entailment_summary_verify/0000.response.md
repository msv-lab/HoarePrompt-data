### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the size of the array `n`.
   - Reads the array `arr`.
   - Checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements.
     - If the array is beautiful (`flag` is `True`), it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
       - It initializes `val` as the first element and `cnt` as `0`.
       - For each element in the array, if it matches `val`, it increments `cnt`.
         - If it doesn't match, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, then resets `cnt` to `0`.
       - After the loop, it updates `ans` with the last `cnt` value.
   - Prints the result based on the value of `ans`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a list of integers for multiple test cases.
- It checks if the list is beautiful (all elements are the same).
- If the list is beautiful, it prints `-1`.
- Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and prints it.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Beautiful Array Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies if the array is already beautiful by checking adjacent elements.
   - This part of the logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - This logic is also correct and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already beautiful by printing `-1`.
   - It correctly identifies the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the function summary and accurately solves the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly handles the problem and the logic described in the function summary is implemented accurately.
