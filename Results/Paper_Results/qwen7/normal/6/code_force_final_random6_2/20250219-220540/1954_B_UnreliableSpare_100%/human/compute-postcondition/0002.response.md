Output State: **`flag` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `flag` to `True`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
