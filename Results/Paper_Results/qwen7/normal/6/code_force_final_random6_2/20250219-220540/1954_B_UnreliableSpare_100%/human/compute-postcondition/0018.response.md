Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The values of `i`, `n`, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` remain unchanged.
