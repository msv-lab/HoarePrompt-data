Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`.
   - `flag` remains False.
   - If `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition `for i in range(1, n)` means that `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - Since the loop condition is `range(1, n)`, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 2).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2.
   - The conditions involving `arr` and `flag` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr[2]` is not equal to `arr[1]`, and `flag` remains False.**
