Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. Since `i` was initially 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ans` was the minimum between `ans` and `cnt` (which was also 0), `cnt` is now 0 and `ans` remains the minimum between `ans` and 0.
