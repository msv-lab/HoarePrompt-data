Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the value at index `i` in `arr` is not equal to `val`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `0`, `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `arr`, or `ans`. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value (which is unknown but assumed to be some value) and `cnt`, which is now 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
