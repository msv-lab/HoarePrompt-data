Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. All other variables retain their initial states.
