Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( n \) and \( m \), the array \( a \), and the command string \( t \).
2. The program initializes variables to keep track of the position and the current product value.
3. The program correctly handles the special cases for the last command ('L' or 'R') by adjusting the initial product value and positions.
4. The program iterates through the command string in reverse order, updating the product value and positions based on the command type ('L' or 'R').
5. The program stores the intermediate results in a list `y` and prints them out correctly.

Given the execution summary and the detailed reasoning above, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and performs the required operations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
