Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` holds the final value after all multiplicative operations, `y` is a list where all elements are 0 except for the last one, which is equal to `k`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. However, the initial values of `i`, `k`, and `y` remain unchanged. The list `y` still has all elements as 0 except for the last one, which is equal to `k`. The values of `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input.
