Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 2, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is 1**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. Given that `q1` was previously unspecified but now `q1 -= 1` is executed, if `q1` was initially set to 2 (or any value), it would become 1 after decrementing by 1. Since no other changes were made to `i`, `n`, or `k`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still -1, `n` is still 2, and `k` remains as `k * a[q1] % m`, with `q1` now being 1.
