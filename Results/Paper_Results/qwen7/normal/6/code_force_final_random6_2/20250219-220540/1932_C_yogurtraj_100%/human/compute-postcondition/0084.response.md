Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0 except `y[-1]` which is equal to `k`.
   - `y[i]` is updated to `k`.
   - `q2` is incremented by 1 if `t[i] == 'R'`.
   - `q1` is decremented by 1 if `t[i] != 'R'`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is running in reverse, the next value of `i` will be either `n - 4` or `n - 5`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The list `y` and its elements remain unchanged unless the loop body updates them, but since no such update is mentioned, they stay the same.
   - The counters `q1` and `q2` will be updated based on the condition `t[i]`, but since the loop hasn't run yet, these values remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `n - 4` or `n - 5` depending on the previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `y` remains the same.
- `q1` and `q2` remain the same.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and `n`, we only need to adjust these two variables.

**State: **`i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 5`, `n` is an integer**
