Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to find a common denominator (`den`) for the multipliers and then distributes the coins based on this denominator. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5
5 5 5 5 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
-1
```
- Actual Output:
```
125 125 125 125 125
```
In this case, the program outputs a distribution where the total amount of coins bet (625) is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome (625). This violates the requirement that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case and hence the overall correctness is **False**.
