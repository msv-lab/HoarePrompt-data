Reasoning:
- The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- `func_1(a, b)` computes the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). This function is used to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which helps in finding a common base for the distribution.
- `func_2()` reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome. It then calculates a denominator `den` by finding the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1()`.
- For each multiplier `r`, it computes `den // r` to get the maximum amount that can be bet on the corresponding outcome without exceeding the winning payout.
- It then adjusts `den` by subtracting the sum of these values to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the winning payout for any outcome.
- If `den` becomes non-positive after the adjustment, it means the conditions cannot be met, and `-1` is printed. Otherwise, it prints the distribution of bets.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the provided functions correctly implement the required functionality to solve the problem.
