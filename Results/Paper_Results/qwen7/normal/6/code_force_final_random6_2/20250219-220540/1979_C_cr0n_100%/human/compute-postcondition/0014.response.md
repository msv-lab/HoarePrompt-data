Based on the initial state provided:

- `N` is an input integer.
- `vals` is a list of `N` integers.
- `den` is the result of applying `func_1` successively to the elements of `vals` starting with the first element and using each subsequent element as the argument for `func_1`.
- `vprod` is a list of integers where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` using integer division.
- `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

Given this information, the code snippet `print(-1)` will execute and print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
