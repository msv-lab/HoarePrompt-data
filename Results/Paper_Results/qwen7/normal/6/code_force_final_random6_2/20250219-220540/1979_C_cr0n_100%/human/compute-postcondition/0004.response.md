Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers, `den` is the result of `func_1(den, x)`, `x` is the first element of `vals`**.

Explanation: The code `den = func_1(den, x)` assigns the value returned by the function `func_1(den, x)` to the variable `den`. The other variables (`N`, `vals`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
