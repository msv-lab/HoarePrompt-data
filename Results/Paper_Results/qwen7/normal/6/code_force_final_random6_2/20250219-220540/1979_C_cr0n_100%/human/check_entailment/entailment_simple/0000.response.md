Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the product of two integers `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Given the constraints \(2 \leq b \leq 20\) and \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), the function correctly computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `N` which represents the number of outcomes.
   - It then reads a list of integers `vals` representing the multipliers for each outcome.
   - The variable `den` is initialized to the first element of `vals`. For each subsequent element in `vals`, `den` is updated by calling `func_1` with `den` and the current element, effectively computing the LCM of all elements in `vals`.
   - After computing the LCM, `vprod` is calculated as a list of integers where each element is the result of dividing `den` by each corresponding element in `vals` using integer division.
   - `den` is then updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, `-1` is printed, indicating that no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, the function prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` aims to find a valid distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.
   - The LCM calculation ensures that the total bet is minimized while satisfying the condition.
   - The final check (`den <= 0`) ensures that the total bet is indeed less than the reward for any outcome.
   - The solution provided in the example matches the expected behavior of the function.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality.
