### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to verify its correctness.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - Computes the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - Ensures that the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - Computes the LCM of all multipliers using `func_1`.
   - Distributes the coins such that the total bet is equal to the LCM minus the sum of individual bets.
   - Prints `-1` if the total bet is not strictly less than the LCM.

#### Analysis of the Given Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 7`
   - Expected Output: `27 41 12`
   - Explanation: The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42. The distribution `27, 41, 12` ensures that the total bet (80) is less than the amounts received back (81, 82, 84).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `2 3 3`
   - Expected Output: `1 1`
   - Explanation: The LCM of 3 and 3 is 3. The distribution `1, 1` ensures that the total bet (2) is less than the amount received back (3, 3).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, and 5 is 5. The total bet (25) is not strictly less than the amount received back (25).

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
   - Expected Output: `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`
   - Explanation: The LCM of 7, 9, 3, 17, 9, and 13 is 16863. The distribution ensures that the total bet (16863 - sum of individual bets) is less than the amounts received back.

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `3 6 3 2`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The LCM of 6, 3, and 2 is 6. The total bet (6) is not strictly less than the amounts received back (18, 6, 12).

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
   - Expected Output: `8 18 12 9 24`
   - Explanation: The LCM of 9, 4, 6, 8, and 3 is 72. The distribution ensures that the total bet (72 - sum of individual bets) is less than the amounts received back.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers.
- It distributes the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM.
- For the test cases where the LCM is equal to the maximum value in `vals`, the program correctly prints `-1`.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all test cases correctly according to the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided test cases and the problem description.
