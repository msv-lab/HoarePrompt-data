Output State: **N is an input integer, and vals is a list of N integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The initial state of `vals` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it. The value of `N` is updated to the integer input, but the actual values within `vals` are not specified or modified by this code. Therefore, `vals` is still a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` satisfies `2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20`.
