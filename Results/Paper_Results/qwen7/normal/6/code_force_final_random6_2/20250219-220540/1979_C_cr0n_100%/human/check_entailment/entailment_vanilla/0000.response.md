Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. 

### Given Code Analysis
The code provided has two functions:

1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

2. **func_2()**: This function processes the input and outputs the required distribution of coins.

#### func_2() Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `N = int(input().strip())`: Reads the number of outcomes.
   - `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]`: Reads the multipliers for each outcome and stores them in a list `vals`.

2. **Calculating Denominator**:
   - `den = vals[0]`: Initializes the denominator with the first multiplier.
   - `for x in vals: den = func_1(den, x)`: Iterates through the multipliers and updates the denominator to the LCM of all multipliers.

3. **Calculating Values**:
   - `vprod = [den // r for r in vals]`: Calculates the value to bet on each outcome as `den // r` where `r` is the multiplier.
   - `den = den - sum(vprod)`: Adjusts the denominator by subtracting the sum of the calculated values.

4. **Output**:
   - If `den <= 0`, prints `-1` indicating no valid solution.
   - Otherwise, prints the values to bet on each outcome.

### Correctness Analysis
To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic and constraints:

1. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The denominator `den` is set to the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that the distribution is fair and balanced across all outcomes.

2. **Value Calculation**:
   - The value to bet on each outcome is calculated as `den // r`. This ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed and leverages the LCM property.

3. **Adjustment**:
   - Subtracting the sum of the calculated values from `den` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back by checking if `den <= 0` and printing `-1` if true.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to distribute coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. It handles edge cases appropriately and uses the LCM to ensure an even distribution.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
