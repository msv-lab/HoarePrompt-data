Output State: **`arr` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and the frequency count of `i` in `freq` is now two.**

Explanation: The code increments the frequency count of `i` in `freq` by 1. Since `i` was previously counted once, it is now counted twice. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
