Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in arr:`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\).
   - `freq` is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is initialized to 0.
   - We need to focus on adjusting the states of `i` and `arr`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will take on each value from `arr` in each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `arr` contains at least one element and `i` is set to the first element of `arr`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
