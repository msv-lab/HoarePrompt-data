Output State: **`cou` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than -1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, we continue the loop with these conditions. If `freq[i]` is less than 2, we also continue the loop with the same conditions.**

Explanation: The code `cou += 1` increments the value of `cou` by 1. Since `cou` was initially either 0 or 1, after this operation, `cou` becomes 1. The increment of `i` and the condition that `n` must still be greater than -1 remain unchanged. The conditions related to `freq[i]` (whether it is greater than or equal to 2) also remain the same.
