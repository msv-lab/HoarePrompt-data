Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The function `func_1` is designed to find the first unique integer in the array `arr` and print it, but this approach does not align with the game rules and objective described in the problem statement.

According to the problem, Alice and Bob are playing a game where Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, and Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The function `func_1` does not simulate the game or calculate the MEX of the final array `c` after both players have played optimally.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
1. Alice will always pick elements to maximize the MEX of `c`.
2. Bob will always pick elements to minimize the MEX of `c`.

Given these points, the optimal strategy involves ensuring that the smallest missing integer (MEX) is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob. The solution should involve counting the frequencies of elements and determining the MEX based on the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

The provided code does not reflect this logic and instead attempts to find the first unique integer in the array, which is irrelevant to the game's outcome.

Correctness: **False**
