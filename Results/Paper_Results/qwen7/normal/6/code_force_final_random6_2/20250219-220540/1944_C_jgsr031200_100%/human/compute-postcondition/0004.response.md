Output State: **`arr` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is incremented by 1, and the frequency count of `i` in `freq` is now one more than its previous value.**

This means that the second element of `arr` (denoted by `i`) had its frequency count in the `freq` list incremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
