State: **`cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than -1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop condition is `range(n + 1)`, which means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n` inclusive.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n + 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `n` must be greater than -1.
4. The variable `cou` is not involved in the loop condition and its initial value is 0, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` initialized to 0, `n` must be greater than -1, and `cou` remains as 0.
