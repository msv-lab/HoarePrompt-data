Output State: The list `arr` has been fully iterated over, and for each element `i` in `arr`, the corresponding value `freq[i]` in the `freq` list has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `arr`. Therefore, `freq` now contains the frequency count of each integer that appeared in `arr`.
