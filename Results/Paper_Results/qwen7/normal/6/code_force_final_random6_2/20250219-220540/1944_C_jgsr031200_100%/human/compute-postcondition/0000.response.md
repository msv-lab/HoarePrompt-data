Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\); freq is a list of length \(n + 1\) where each element is initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `freq` of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. The list `arr` remains unchanged from its initial state.
