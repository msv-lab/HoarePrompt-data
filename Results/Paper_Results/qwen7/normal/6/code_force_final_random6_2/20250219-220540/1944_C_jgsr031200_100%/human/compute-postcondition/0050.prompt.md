You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `arr` has been fully iterated over, and for each element `i` in `arr`, the corresponding value `freq[i]` in the `freq` list has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `arr`. Therefore, `freq` now contains the frequency count of each integer that appeared in `arr`.
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` has reached `n+1`. The value of `cou` is either 0 or 1, depending on how many times `freq[i]` was 1 during the loop's execution. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial value. If at any point `freq[i]` was 0, the loop would have broken early, and if `freq[i]` was greater than or equal to 2, the loop would have continued without breaking.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\). It returns a value based on the relationship between the elements in the list and the integer \(n\).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
