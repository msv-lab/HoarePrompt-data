Output State: **`cou` remains 0 or becomes 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` must still be greater than -1, and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. This means that regardless of the current state of `cou`, `i`, `n`, and the condition involving `freq[i]`, the loop will terminate. The values of `cou`, `i`, and `n` remain as they were before the `break` statement, but it is noted that we break out of the loop.
