You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = m
            b[i] = n
        else:
            n = min(a[i], b[i])
            m = max(a[i], b[i])
            a[i] = n
            b[i] = m
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9, and modifies them in place. For the first half of the strings, it ensures that the larger digit is placed in the first string (`a`) and the smaller in the second string (`b`). For the second half, it does the opposite, placing the smaller digit in `a` and the larger in `b`. Finally, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b` to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b`, which represent the numbers `x` and `y`.

2. **Swapping Digits:**
   - The program converts the strings `a` and `b` into lists of characters.
   - It then iterates through the digits of `a` and `b` up to the middle of the strings.
     - For the first half of the digits, it swaps the minimum digit between `a[i]` and `b[i]` with the maximum digit.
     - For the second half of the digits, it swaps the minimum digit between `a[i]` and `b[i]` with the maximum digit.
   - This ensures that the largest possible digits are moved towards the most significant positions in both `a` and `b`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the modified lists `a` and `b` as strings.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the pairs of numbers `x` and `y`.

- **Swapping Logic:**
  - The logic for swapping digits is implemented correctly. It ensures that the largest digits are moved towards the most significant positions in both `a` and `b`.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the requirement where each test case outputs two lines, one for `x` and one for `y`.

- **Additional Constraints:**
  - The program correctly handles the additional constraint that the digits are from 1 to 9.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their digits. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
