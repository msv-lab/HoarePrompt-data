Postcondition: `a` and `b` are lists with the same length. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, then the element at index `i` in `a` is updated to the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is updated to `m`. Otherwise, the element at index `i` in `a` is updated to `n`, and `b[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `n` and `b[i]`.
