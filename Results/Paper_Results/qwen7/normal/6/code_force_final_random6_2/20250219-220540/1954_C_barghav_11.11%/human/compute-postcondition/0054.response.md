Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(b))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (because `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`).
   - The length of the list `b` remains the same, but it must still have at least 2 elements to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is 2
- `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements**
