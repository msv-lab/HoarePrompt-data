Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the lengths of two string inputs, x and y, are equal. Both x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include parameters x and y directly in the function definition. However, based on the problem statement, the function should implicitly accept two string parameters x and y with specific constraints and return a boolean value indicating if their lengths are equal.
