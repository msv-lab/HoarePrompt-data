Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of the same length, `i` is `len(a)`, `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`**.

This means that `n` is assigned the minimum value between the `i`-th element of list `a` and the `i`-th element of list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
