Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of the same length, `i` is `len(a)`, `b[i]` is equal to `n`, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `a[i]` is now equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] = n` updates the value of `b[i]` to be equal to `n`. The value of `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `m`, and `a[i]`) retain their previous states.
