Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of the same length where, for each index `i`:

- For indices from 0 to 2 (inclusive), the element at index `i` in `a` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.
- For indices from 3 to the length of `a` - 1 (inclusive), the element at index `i` in `a` is the minimum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`, and the element at index `i` in `b` is the maximum value between the original elements at indices `i` in `a` and `b`.

This means that the first three elements of list `a` will be the maximum values of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, while the last part of the list will have the minimum values, following the described swapping rule.
