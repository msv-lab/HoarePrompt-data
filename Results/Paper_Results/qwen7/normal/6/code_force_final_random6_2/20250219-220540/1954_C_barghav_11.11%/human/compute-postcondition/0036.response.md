Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of the same length, `i` is `len(a)`, `m` is the maximum value between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, and `b[i]` is equal to `m`.**

This means that the value of `b[i]` has been updated to the maximum value between `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, while the other variables remain unchanged with their initial values.
