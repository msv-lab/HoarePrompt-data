Postcondition: `b` must be at least 0, `suma` is increased by 1, and `x` is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i). This is because if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true, then `suma` is increased by 1. If these conditions are false, no change is made to `suma`, and the other variables retain their original values as per the precondition.
