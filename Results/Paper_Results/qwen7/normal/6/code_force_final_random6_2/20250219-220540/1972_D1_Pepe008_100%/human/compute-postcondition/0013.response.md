Postcondition: `suma` is increased by 1, `b` must be at least 1, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, then the condition holds true and `suma` remains increased by 1. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, but `suma` still has been increased by 1.
