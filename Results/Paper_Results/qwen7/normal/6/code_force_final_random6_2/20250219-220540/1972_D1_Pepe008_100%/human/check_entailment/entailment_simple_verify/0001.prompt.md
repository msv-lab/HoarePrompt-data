You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` must be greater than 16, `i` is 17, `x` is calculated based on the current value of `i`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for each iteration, and the final `suma` is 103.
    #
    #To explain this output state in more detail:
    #- Since the loop increments `i` starting from 5 and runs through at least 7 iterations initially, and given that `i` must continue to increment, after all iterations, `i` will be 17.
    #- The value of `b` must be greater than 16 because the loop increments `i` up to the point where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` no longer holds true, which happens when `i` reaches 17.
    #- The value of `x` changes with each iteration of `i`. For `i=17`, `x` would be calculated as `(a - 17 * 16) // 289 + 1`.
    #- The `suma` variable accumulates the value of `x` for each valid iteration where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` holds true. Based on the pattern observed, the total increase in `suma` after all iterations is 103.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `suma` is initialized to 0. This will be used to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Loop Through Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The program iterates through all possible values of `b` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).

4. **Calculating `x`:**
   - For each value of `b`, it calculates `x` using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.

5. **Additional Condition Check:**
   - It checks if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0` are true.
   - If both conditions are met, it adds 1 to `suma`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Formula for `x`:**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be an attempt to count something, but it does not directly relate to the problem statement.

2. **Conditions Check:**
   - The conditions `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` do not seem to be relevant to the problem constraints.

3. **GCD Requirement:**
   - The problem requires `a + b` to be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The given code does not check this condition at all.

4. **Output Adjustment:**
   - The final output adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and does not align with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. It uses a formula and conditions that do not match the required constraints and does not properly account for the gcd requirement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
