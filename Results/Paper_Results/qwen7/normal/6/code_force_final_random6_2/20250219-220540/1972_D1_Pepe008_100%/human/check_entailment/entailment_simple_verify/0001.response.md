### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Formula for `x`:**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not related to the problem constraints. It seems to be an attempt to count something, but it doesn't align with the required conditions.

2. **Irrelevant Conditions Check:**
   - The conditions `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are irrelevant to the problem. These conditions do not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **GCD Requirement:**
   - The code does not compute or use the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) of \(a\) and \(b\). This is a critical part of the problem.

4. **Output Adjustment:**
   - The final output adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and does not align with the problem requirements.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)
```

This code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\), computes the gcd, and checks the required condition.

### Final Evaluation
Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original assessment was inaccurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

**Final: False**
