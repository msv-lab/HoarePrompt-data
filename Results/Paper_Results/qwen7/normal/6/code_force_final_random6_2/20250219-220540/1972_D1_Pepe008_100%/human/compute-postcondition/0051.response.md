Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `b` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `suma` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `b + 1`.

4. **Check the loop condition at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `b` is greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - Therefore, `b` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Final state**:
   - `b` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `x` remains 0.
   - `suma` remains 1.

**Answer**:
State: **`b` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `x` is 0, `suma` is 1**
