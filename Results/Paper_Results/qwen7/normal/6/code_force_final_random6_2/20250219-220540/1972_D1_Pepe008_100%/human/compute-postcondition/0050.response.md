Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x` is 0, and `suma` is 1. This is because if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is true, then `i` is set to 2, `x` is set to 0, and `suma` is set to 1. If the condition is false, the values of `b`, `i`, `x`, and `suma` remain unchanged.
