Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. It splits the input into `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Main Calculation Loop**: The loop iterates from `1` to `b` (inclusive). For each `i` in this range, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.

3. **Condition Check**: The code checks if the expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is greater than `0` before adding `x` to `suma`. This ensures that only valid values of `x` are considered.

4. **Additional Condition**: There is an additional check to see if `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`. If both conditions are met, `suma` is incremented by `1` again.

5. **Final Output**: After the loop, `suma` is printed minus `2`. This subtraction of `2` is not explained in the problem statement, so we need to verify if it is necessary or if it affects the solution.

Given the problem statement, the goal is to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the provided code does not directly implement this logic. Instead, it uses a different approach involving the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and additional conditions, which do not align with the problem requirements.

The provided example and the annotated program state that the code is supposed to work for specific values, but the logic does not match the problem's constraints. Therefore, the code is not solving the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
