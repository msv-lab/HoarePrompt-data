You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: Output State: `b` must be greater than 16, `i` is 17, `x` is calculated based on the current value of `i`, `suma` is increased by the sum of `x` values for each iteration, and the final `suma` is 103.
    #
    #To explain this output state in more detail:
    #- Since the loop increments `i` starting from 5 and runs through at least 7 iterations initially, and given that `i` must continue to increment, after all iterations, `i` will be 17.
    #- The value of `b` must be greater than 16 because the loop increments `i` up to the point where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` no longer holds true, which happens when `i` reaches 17.
    #- The value of `x` changes with each iteration of `i`. For `i=17`, `x` would be calculated as `(a - 17 * 16) // 289 + 1`.
    #- The `suma` variable accumulates the value of `x` for each valid iteration where the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` holds true. Based on the pattern observed, the total increase in `suma` after all iterations is 103.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m, with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of n and m.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
