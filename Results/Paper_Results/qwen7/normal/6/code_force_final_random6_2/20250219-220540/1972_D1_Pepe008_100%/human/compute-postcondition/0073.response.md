Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, b + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 5.
   - `b` is initially set to a value that is greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - Initially, `i` is 5, and `b` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, b + 1)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is 5, for the loop to start, `b` must be at least 5 (because `i` must be less than or equal to `b`).
   - The other variables (`x`, `suma`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `info`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` must be greater than or equal to 5 and `i` is 5.

**State: **`b` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5**
