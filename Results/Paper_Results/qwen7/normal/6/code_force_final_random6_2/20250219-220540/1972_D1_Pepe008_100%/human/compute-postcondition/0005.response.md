Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `range(1, b + 1)`).
   - `b` is an integer derived from `info[1]`, where `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1, so the loop will execute if `b` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer equal to `int(info[0])`.
- `b` is an integer equal to `int(info[1])`.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.
- `suma` is 0.

We need to focus on adjusting the states related to the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

Since `i` is already set to 1, we only need to ensure that `b` is at least 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`b` must be at least 1**.
