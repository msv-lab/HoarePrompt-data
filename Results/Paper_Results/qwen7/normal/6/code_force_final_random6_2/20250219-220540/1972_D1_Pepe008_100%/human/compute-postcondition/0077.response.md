Output State: **`b` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `x` is (a - 25) // 25 + 1, `suma` is increased by x**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is assigned the value of `suma + x`. Since `x` is defined as `(a - 25) // 25 + 1`, `x` remains unchanged. The other variables (`b`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `b` remains greater than or equal to 5, `i` remains 5, and `x` remains its original value. `suma` is increased by the value of `x`.
