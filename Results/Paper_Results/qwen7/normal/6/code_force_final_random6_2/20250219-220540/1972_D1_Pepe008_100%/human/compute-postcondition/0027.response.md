Output State: **`b` must be at least 0, `suma` is increased by `x`, and `x` is equal to ((a - i * (i - 1)) // i**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`. The value of `x` is calculated as `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)`. The initial conditions for `b` and the formula for `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` must still be at least 0, and `suma` now includes the added value of `x`.
