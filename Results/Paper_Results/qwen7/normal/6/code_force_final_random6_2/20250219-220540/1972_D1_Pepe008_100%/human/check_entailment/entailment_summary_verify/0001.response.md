### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not properly account for the gcd requirement and uses formulas that do not align with the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the code and the problem statement to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Statement Recap

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `suma` is initialized to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.

3. **Loop Through Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - The code iterates through all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

4. **Calculating \(x\):**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is used, which does not seem to be related to the problem constraints.

5. **Additional Condition Check:**
   - The conditions `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are irrelevant to the problem.

6. **Output:**
   - The final output is printed as `suma - 2`, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

#### Correct Solution Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

This corrected code:
1. Iterates through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Counts and prints the number of valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
