Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for c in s`. The objects involved here are `c` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `c` is the last element in `s` after all iterations.
   - `s` is the string or list being iterated over.
   - `n` is decremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `s`.
   - `c` takes on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `s`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `c` is the last element in `s` after all iterations, before the loop starts, `c` should be the first element of `s`.
   - `s` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `c` and `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is the first element of `s`, `s` is a non-empty sequence**
