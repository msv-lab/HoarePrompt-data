Output State: **`zeroes` is now equal to the count of 0s in the original list `s`; `ans` remains unchanged (as it was calculated before this line of code); `t` remains unchanged; `n` is now `n-1`; `cnt` is `[0, 0]`; `c` remains unchanged.**

The code `cnt = [0, 0]` initializes the list `cnt` with the values `[0, 0]`. All other variables (`zeroes`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
