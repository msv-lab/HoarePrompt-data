Output State: **`ans` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is [1, 0], `c` equals 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Since `cnt` is initialized as `[1, 0]`, `cnt[1]` is 0. Therefore, the condition `cnt[1] > 0` is false, and `ans` remains unchanged (still 0). However, the problem statement mentions that initially `ans` is 0, so after adding 0 to `ans`, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
