Output State: **`c` is the next element in `s`, `cnt[c]` is now `cnt[c] + 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0` else `ans` remains the same.**

This means that `c` remains the next element in `s`, `cnt[c]` is updated to `cnt[c] + 1`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 only if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 before the operation. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
