Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `c` is being iterated over the elements of `s`. The other variables involved are `ans`, `zeroes`, and `cnt[c]`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `s` to iterate over.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition**:
   - `ans` is incremented by either 1 (if `c` is 0) or `zeroes - cnt[0]` (if `c` is not 0).
   - `c` is not equal to 0.
   - `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the first element of `s`.
   - `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `c` is not equal to 0, it means the current element of `s` is not 0.
   - `ans` will be incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
   - `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ans` will be incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
   - `cnt[c]` will be incremented by 1.
   - `c` will be the next element in `s`.

Given the postcondition and the analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
- `c` is the next element in `s`.

Since `c` is not equal to 0, the next element in `s` will be the one that was previously `c`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in `s`**
