### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. This is the correct condition for determining if the digits form a stair.
   - **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. This is the correct condition for determining if the digits form a peak.
   - **Neither Condition**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program correctly prints "NONE".
4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
