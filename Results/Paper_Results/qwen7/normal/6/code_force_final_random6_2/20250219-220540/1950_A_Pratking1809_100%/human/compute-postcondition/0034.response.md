Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. The function reads the number of test cases from the user and then iterates through each case, performing the necessary comparisons and printing the result. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
