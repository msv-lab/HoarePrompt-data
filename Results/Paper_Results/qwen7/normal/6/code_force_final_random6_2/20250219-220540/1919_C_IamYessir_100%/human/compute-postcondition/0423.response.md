Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of the list `a`. `b` is a list with one more element than before and the appended element is `lit[1]`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If `x > y`, then `y` is updated to `lit[1]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, otherwise no change is made to `y`. If `x <= y`, then `a` is updated to include the element from `lit[1]` appended to the original list, and `x` is either infinity or the last element of the updated list `a`.
