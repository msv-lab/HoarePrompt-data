Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `len(b)` is greater than 1
   - `s` is 2 (though this variable is not part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `len(b)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `len(b)` is greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `len(b)` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `len(b)` is greater than 3, and `s` is 2**
