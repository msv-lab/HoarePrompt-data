Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are both empty lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)` + 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty. If `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x` and greater than `y`, `a` is now `['lit[i]']`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.**
