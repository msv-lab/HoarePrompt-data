Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list ending with either `x` (where `x` is greater than `y`) or `lit[0]`, `i` is 0, `y` is the last element of list `b`, and the condition `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y` holds true for the current value of `x`, unless `y >= lit[i]`, in which case `b` has an additional element equal to `lit[0]`.
