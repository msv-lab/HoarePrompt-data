Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[1]`, `i` is 2. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is positive infinity (`float('inf')`). Otherwise, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a.append(lit[1])` appends `lit[1]` to `a`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
