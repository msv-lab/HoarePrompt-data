Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding elements, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If `x` is greater than `y`, then `x` remains greater than `y`, `a` remains as it is, and `y` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then `x` is updated according to the following rules: 
- If `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is the last element of list `a`, then `x` is set to `lit[0]`.
- If `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is not the last element of list `a`, then `a` is updated to be a non-empty list with `lit[0]` as its last element, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`.
- If `x` is less than `y`, then `a` remains unchanged and `x` remains the last element of list `a`.
- If `x` is greater than `y` and `x` is less than `lit[0]`, then `lit[0]` is appended to list `b` if it is not already greater than `y`, otherwise it is not appended to list `b`.
- If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`, then `a` remains unchanged and `x` remains the last element of list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where `x` is either infinity or the last element of the list `a`. `b` is a list with one more element than before and the appended element is `lit[1]`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If `x > y`, then `y` is updated to `lit[1]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, otherwise no change is made to `y`. If `x <= y`, then `a` is updated to include `lit[1]` appended to the original list, and `x` is either infinity or the last element of the updated list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is either `float('inf')` or the value appended from `lit[i]`, `b` is a list with three elements where the last element is `lit[2]` if `x == y` is true, otherwise the last element is `b[1]` if `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x` is true, and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[2]`. Otherwise, depending on the condition in the else part, `y` is either updated to `b[1]` if `b` is not empty, or remains as `float('inf')` if `b` is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
