Postcondition: **`a` is now possibly containing the element `lit[i]` if `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`. `b` remains empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**
