Output State: **`cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `x` is positive infinity (`float('inf')`)**.

The variable `x` is assigned the value of positive infinity using `float('inf')`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
