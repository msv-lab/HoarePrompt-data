Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` ends with either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 0, `y` is the last element of list `b`, and the condition `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y` holds true for the current value of `x`, or `b` has an additional element which is equal to `lit[0]`.
