Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`, `i` is 4, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not). If `x >= lit[i]`, then `i` is 4 and `x` is `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `b` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` can be any list.
