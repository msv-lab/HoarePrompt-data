Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`, `i` is 0, `y` is the last element of list `b`, `y` is less than or equal to `lit[i]`, and the current value of `x` satisfies `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`.
