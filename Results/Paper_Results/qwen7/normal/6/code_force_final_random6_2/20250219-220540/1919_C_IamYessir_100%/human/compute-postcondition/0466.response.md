Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` (inclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `a` is a non-empty list

4. **Loop Body Behavior**:
   - If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i-1]`, then `s` remains 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If the condition is not met, the loop terminates.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will check if `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`.
   - If the condition is true, `s` will remain 1 and `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - If the condition is false, the loop will terminate.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` remains 1.
   - `i` will be incremented to 3 if the condition is true.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

Given that the condition `a[i] > a[i-1]` might or might not be true, we need to consider both scenarios. However, since the problem asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume the condition is true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `s` is 1
- `i` is 3
- `a` remains a non-empty list

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a non-empty list**
