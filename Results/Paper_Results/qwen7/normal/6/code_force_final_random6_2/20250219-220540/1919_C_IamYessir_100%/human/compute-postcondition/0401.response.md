Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`; `b` is a list with one additional element at the end which is `lit[i]`; `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty); `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 1, `lit[i]` refers to `lit[1]`. Since `i` is 1, the value of `lit[1]` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be appended to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
