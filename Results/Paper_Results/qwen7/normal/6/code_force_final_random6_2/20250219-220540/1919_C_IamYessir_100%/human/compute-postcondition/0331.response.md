Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, the list `b` is currently empty, `y` is infinity.**

This output state reflects that the variable `y` has been assigned the value of infinity (`float('inf')`), while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
