Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is less than `y`. If `x` (which is the last element of list `a`) is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`, then `a` remains unchanged and `x` is still the last element of list `a`. If `x` is less than `lit[0]`, then `lit[0]` is appended to list `b` if it is not already greater than `y`, otherwise it is not appended to list `b`.
