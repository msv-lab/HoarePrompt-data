Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 1, `x` is positive infinity (`float('inf')`), and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

The value of `x` is set to positive infinity (`float('inf')`), which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
