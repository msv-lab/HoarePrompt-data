Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`, `i` is 4, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is `lit[i]`), and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not).**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 3, after executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (becoming 4) because list indices start from 0. The last element of `a` is now `lit[i]`, which is `lit[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
