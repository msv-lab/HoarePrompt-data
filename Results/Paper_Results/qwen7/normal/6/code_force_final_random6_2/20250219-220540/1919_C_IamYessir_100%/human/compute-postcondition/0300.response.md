Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, len(b))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since `range(1, len(b))` starts from 1).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(b)` for the loop to execute.

4. **Final State of `i`:**
   - After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of list `b`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The problem states that after the loop executes all iterations, the variables `s`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `lit`, `x`, `y`, and `n` will retain their values from the final iteration of the loop or their initial states if they were not modified by the loop.
   - Since the loop head only involves `i` and `len(b)`, no adjustments are needed for `s`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `lit`, `x`, `y`, and `n`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(b)`.

**State:**
- `i` is 1 (initial value).
- `len(b)` must be greater than 1 (to ensure the loop can execute at least once).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than 1**.
