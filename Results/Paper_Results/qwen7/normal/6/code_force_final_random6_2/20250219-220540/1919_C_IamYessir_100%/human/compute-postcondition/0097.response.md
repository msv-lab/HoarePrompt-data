Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list containing one element which is `lit[1]`, `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is initially 1, after executing the code, `i` becomes 2 (since `i` is incremented by 1 due to the nature of the append operation in this context). The value of `lit[i]` is `lit[1]`, so `b` now contains `lit[1]`. Since `b` was previously empty or contained elements, appending `lit[1]` means `b` now has one element, and `y` is updated to be the last element of `b`, which is `lit[1]`.
