Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of the list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If `x < y`, then `a` is updated to include the element from `lit[1]` appended to the original list, and `x` is either infinity or the last element of the updated list `a`. Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged, with `x` being either infinity or the last element of list `a`.**
