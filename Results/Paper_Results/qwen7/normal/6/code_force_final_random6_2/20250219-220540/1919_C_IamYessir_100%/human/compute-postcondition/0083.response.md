Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 1. If `b` is an empty list, then `y` is positive infinity (`float('inf')`). Otherwise, `y` is the last element of list `b`.
