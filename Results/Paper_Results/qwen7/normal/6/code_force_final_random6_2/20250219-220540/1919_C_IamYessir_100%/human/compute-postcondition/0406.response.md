Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[1]` and `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, and `b` is a list with one more element than before where the appended element is `lit[1]`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `x` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
