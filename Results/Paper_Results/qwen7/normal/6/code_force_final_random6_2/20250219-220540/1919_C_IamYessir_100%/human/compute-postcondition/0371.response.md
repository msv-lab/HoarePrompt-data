Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than `lit[i]`.
