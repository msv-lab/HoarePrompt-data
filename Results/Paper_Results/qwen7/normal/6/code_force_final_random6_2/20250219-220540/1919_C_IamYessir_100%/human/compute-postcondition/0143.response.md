Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 4, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`), and `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of `b` (depending on whether `b` is empty or not). 

- If `x > y`, then:
  - `b` contains one additional element which is `lit[3]` if `y >= lit[i]`.
  - `lit[i]` becomes the last element of `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `y < lit[i]`.
  - Otherwise, the values of `cp`, `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
  
- If `x <= y`, then:
  - `i` remains 4 and `x` remains `lit[i]`.
  - If `x == y`, then `b` can be any list.
  - If `x < y`, then `b` can be any list.
  - If `x >= y` and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `b` is a list with its last element being `lit[i]`.
