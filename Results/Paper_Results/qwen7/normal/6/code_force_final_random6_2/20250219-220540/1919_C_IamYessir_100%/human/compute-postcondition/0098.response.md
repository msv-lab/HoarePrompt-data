Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 2, `b` is a list containing one element which is `lit[1]`. If `y` (which is the last element of list `b`) is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is set to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.
