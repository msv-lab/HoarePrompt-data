Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are both empty lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is the length of `b` or `len(b) + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and if `y >= lit[i]`, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` is updated to contain the i-th element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged and `b` is updated to contain the i-th element of `lit` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`.**
