Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being `x`, `i` is 0, `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`, `y` is the last element of list `b`, `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `y` was previously defined as the last element of `b`, after appending `lit[i]` to `b`, `y` will now be `lit[i]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
