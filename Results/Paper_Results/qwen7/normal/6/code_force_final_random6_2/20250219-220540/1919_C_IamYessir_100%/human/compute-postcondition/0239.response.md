Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are both lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces. If `a` is empty, `x` is float('inf'), otherwise `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]`. `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**
