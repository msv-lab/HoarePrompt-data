Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[0]` and `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty). The current value of `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and if the condition `(lit[i] > x and x >= y)` is satisfied, then `x` remains unchanged and the condition `x > y` still holds. If the condition is not satisfied, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` and the condition `x > y` may change.
