Output State: **`a` is a list, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `a` is not specified, `x` takes the value of `a[-1]`, which is the last element of `a`.
