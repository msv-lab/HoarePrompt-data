Output State: **`ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb` minus 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `r` is `m`, `ca[a[r - m]]` has been decremented by 1, `ca[a[r]]` has been incremented by 1, and `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0, so now it becomes 1. All other variables (`sm`, `m`, `r`, `ca[a[r - m]]`, `ca[a[r]]`, and `sm`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
