Output State: **`ans` is 0, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb` minus 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `r` is `m`, `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `sm -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `sm`. Since `sm` was initially the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`, after executing this line, `sm` will be that sum minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
