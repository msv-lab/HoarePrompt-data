#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `ans` is 1, `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1

            ans += 1
        
    #State: The final value of `ans` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is `n - m`. The value of `sm` will be the initial value of `sm` minus the total number of times `sm` was decremented (which is `n - m`). The variable `r` will be equal to `n - 1`. The list `ca` will have its elements updated based on the increments and decrements performed during each iteration, and `cb` will remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans`, which is `n - m`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five parameters: n, m, and k (integers with specific constraints), and two lists a and b (each containing integers within certain ranges). It calculates and returns the value of `ans`, which is `n - m`. During its execution, it compares the counts of elements in lists a and b, updates these counts as it iterates through list a, and increments a counter `ans` whenever the sum of minimum counts of common elements reaches or exceeds k.
