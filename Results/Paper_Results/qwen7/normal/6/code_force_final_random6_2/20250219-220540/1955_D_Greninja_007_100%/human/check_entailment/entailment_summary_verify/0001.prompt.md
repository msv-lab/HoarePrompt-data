You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Note

In the first example, all subsegments are good.

In the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1 , 2 , and 3 .

In the third example, good subsegments start at positions 1 and 2 .

- Program:
from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts five parameters: n, m, and k (integers with specific constraints), and two lists a and b (each containing integers within certain ranges). It calculates and returns the value of `ans`, which is `n - m`. During its execution, it compares the counts of elements in lists a and b, updates these counts as it iterates through list a, and increments a counter `ans` whenever the sum of minimum counts of common elements reaches or exceeds k.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, as well as the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Counter Initialization**: It initializes counters for the sorted versions of `b` and the initial segment of `a` of length `m`. This is done using `Counter(sorted(b))` and `Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`.

3. **Initial Good Subsegment Check**: It checks if the initial segment of `a` of length `m` contains at least `k` elements that are also in `b`. This is done by calculating `sum((ca & cb).values())`, which counts the intersection of the two counters.

4. **Sliding Window Technique**: The program uses a sliding window approach to check subsequent segments of `a` of length `m`. For each new element added to the window from the right (`a[r]`), it increments the corresponding counter value. For each element removed from the left (`a[r - m]`), it decrements the corresponding counter value. It also adjusts the sum of matching elements accordingly.

5. **Good Subsegment Count**: If the sum of matching elements is at least `k` after any adjustment, it increments the answer counter `ans`.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total count of good subsegments for each test case.

Given the logic and implementation, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. It handles the sliding window efficiently and accurately updates the count of good subsegments.
