Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the integer value of `math.ceil(k / m)`, `n` is the length of the list `N` minus 1, `L[0]` is assigned to `n`, `L[1]` is assigned to `m`, `L[2]` is assigned to `k`, `N` is the list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`**.

This means that after executing the line `cost = mu * w`, the variable `cost` has been calculated as the product of `mu` and `w`. All other variables retain their previous states, with `t` being greater than 1, `L` and `M` remaining as lists of integers, `N` as a list of the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, and `m`, `k`, `q`, `n`, `L[0]`, `L[1]`, `L[2]`, `w`, and `mu` retaining their previously defined relationships and values.
