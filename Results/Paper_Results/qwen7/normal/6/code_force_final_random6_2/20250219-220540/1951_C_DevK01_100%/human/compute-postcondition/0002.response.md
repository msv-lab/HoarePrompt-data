Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an int type using the map function, and then creates a list `L` from these integers. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
