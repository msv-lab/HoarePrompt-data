Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `mu` using the formula `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`. Here, `k` is the third element of `L`, `n` is the length of the list `N`, and `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`. The value of `mu` is computed and stored in the variable `mu`. All other variables remain unchanged.
