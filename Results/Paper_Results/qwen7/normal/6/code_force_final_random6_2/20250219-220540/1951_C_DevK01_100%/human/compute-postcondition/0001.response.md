State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
4. Other variables or states not mentioned in the loop head (like `t` itself) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is greater than 0.
