Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from the input string, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the integer value of `math.ceil(k / m)`, `n` is the length of the list `N` minus 1, `L[0]` is assigned to `n`, `L[1]` is assigned to `m`, `L[2]` is assigned to `k`, `N` is the list containing the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `mu` as `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `n` is updated to be the length of the list `N` minus 1, and then `L[0]` is assigned to `n`, `L[1]` is assigned to `m`, and `L[2]` is assigned to `k`. The list `N` remains as the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, and `w` is the last element of `N` before it is popped. The value of `mu` is computed using the updated values of `n` and `m`.
