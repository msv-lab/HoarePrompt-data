You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs left to process. The state of `L` will be a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the final list `N`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L` from the last iteration. `M` will be a sorted list of integers converted from the last input string. `N` will be a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, where `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`. The variable `m` will be the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`, and `k` will be `L[2]` from the last iteration. The loop will have completed all its iterations, and the `continue` statement will not be executed since the condition `t > 0` will be false when `t` becomes 0.
    #
    #The `cost` calculation will depend on the specific values of `N`, `m`, and `k` from the last iteration, but it will be printed for the last iteration before the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers t, n, m, k, and a list a of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the list a, calculates a cost based on the sorted list and given parameters, and prints the cost. The function ensures that the cost calculation respects the constraints on n, m, and k. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total cost for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a given day affects the prices of subsequent days. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a particular day. 

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```
- Expected output: `10` (as explained in the problem statement).

However, the program's logic does not correctly simulate the price increase mechanism. It sorts the list of prices and then tries to distribute the tickets across the days without accurately reflecting the price changes due to previous purchases. This leads to incorrect calculations of the minimum spending required to purchase the tickets.

To illustrate, let's walk through the provided example step-by-step:

1. **Initial Prices**: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
2. **First Day**: No tickets are purchased, so the prices remain `[8, 6, 4, 2]`.
3. **Second Day**: No tickets are purchased, so the prices remain `[8, 6, 4, 2]`.
4. **Third Day**: Purchase 1 ticket, so the price for the next day increases by 1 (from 2 to 3). The updated prices are `[8, 6, 4, 3]`.
5. **Fourth Day**: Purchase 2 tickets, so the price for the next day increases by 2 (from 3 to 5). The updated prices are `[8, 6, 5]`.

The correct minimum cost would be:
- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket at 4.
- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets at 3 and 5, which totals to 8.

Thus, the correct minimum cost is `4 + 3 + 5 = 12`, but the program incorrectly calculates this as `10`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
