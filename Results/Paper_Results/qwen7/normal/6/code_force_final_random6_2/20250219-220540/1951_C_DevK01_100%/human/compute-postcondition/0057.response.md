To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the formula for `cost`.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is the length of `N`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `L` is a list where:
     - `L[0]` is the length of the list `M`.
     - `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers.
     - `L[2]` is the third element of `L`.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers converted from input.
   - `N` is a sublist of `M` containing the first `q` elements of `M`.
   - `m` is the smaller value between `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
   - `k` is `L[2]`.
   - `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`.
   - `cost` is either:
     - `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`.
     - `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` if `n * m != k`, where `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`.

2. **Determine the Value of `cost`:**
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `N`, `L`, and other variables are not provided, we need to consider the conditions under which `cost` is calculated.
   - We know that `cost` depends on whether `n * m == k` or `n * m != k`.
   - Without specific values, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cost`, but we can describe it based on the given conditions.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(cost)` statement will print the value of `cost` based on the conditions described above.

Given the lack of specific values, the precise value of `cost` cannot be determined numerically. Therefore, the output will be described based on the conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is either m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m == k, or mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu if n * m != k, with mu = k - (n - 1) * m)**
