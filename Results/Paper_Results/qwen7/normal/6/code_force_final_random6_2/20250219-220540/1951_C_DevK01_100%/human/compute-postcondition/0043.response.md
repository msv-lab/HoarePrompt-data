Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers where `L[0]` is the length of the list `M`, `L[1]` is the minimum value between the input integers, and `L[2]` is the third element of `L`, `M` is a list of integers converted from input, `N` is a list containing the first `L[0]` elements of `M`, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `L[1]`, and `k` is `L[2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `L[0]`, `L[1]`, and `L[2]` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `t`, `L`, `M`, and `N` remain unchanged.
