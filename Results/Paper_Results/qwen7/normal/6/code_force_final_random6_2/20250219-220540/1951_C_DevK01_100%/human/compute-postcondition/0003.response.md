Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `M = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a string input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `M`. The initial state of `t` and `L` remains unchanged.
