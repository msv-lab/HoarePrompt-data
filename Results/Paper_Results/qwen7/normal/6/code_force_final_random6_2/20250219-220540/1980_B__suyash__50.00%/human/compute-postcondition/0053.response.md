Output: **MAYBE** 

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `i` is 1 and `k` is defined as `k - dic[l[0]]`. However, the value of `k` itself is not explicitly given, nor is the dictionary `dic` or the list `l`. The only thing we know for certain is that `l` has at least one element. The print statement simply outputs the string 'MAYBE', and does not depend on the values of `i`, `k`, `dic`, or `l`. Therefore, the output will be the string 'MAYBE'.
