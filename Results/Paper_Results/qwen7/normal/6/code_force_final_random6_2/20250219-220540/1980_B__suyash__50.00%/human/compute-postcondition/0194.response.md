Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[3]]`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` decrements `k` by the value of `dic[l[i]]`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[3]]`. Additionally, since `k` was already less than or equal to 0 before the execution of this line, it remains so after the decrement. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being 3, `k` being decreased by `dic[l[3]]`, and `k` still being less than or equal to 0.
