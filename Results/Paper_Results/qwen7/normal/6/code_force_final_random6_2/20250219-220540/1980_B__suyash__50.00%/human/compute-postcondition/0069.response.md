Output: **MAYBE** 

Explanation: The initial state only provides the value of `i` as 2 and mentions that `l` must have at least one element. It also states that `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]` but remains greater than or equal to 0. However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string 'MAYBE', and no other variables or objects are referenced in this statement. Therefore, the output is exactly 'MAYBE'.
