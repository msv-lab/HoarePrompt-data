Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is the same as before, `l` has been fully traversed, `k` is the third element of the list `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string `a` and converting each element to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `f` is the second element of the list `b`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the loop when `continue` is encountered, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and states mentioned in the initial state are still valid after the execution of the `continue` statement.
