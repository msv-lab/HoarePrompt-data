Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `l` must have at least one element, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]` and remains greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if and else parts. Whether `fav` equals `l[i]` or not, the final state includes `i` being 2, `l` having at least one element, `k` being decreased by `dic[l[1]]` and remaining non-negative, and the termination of the loop or if statement.
