Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k - dic[l[0]]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `k`. The value of `k` remains as `k - dic[l[0]]` because the code snippet does not modify it further. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the implied loop or conditional block.
