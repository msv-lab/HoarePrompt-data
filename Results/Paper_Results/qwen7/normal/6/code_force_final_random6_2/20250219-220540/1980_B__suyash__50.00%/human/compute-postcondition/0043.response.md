Postcondition: `i` is 0, `l` must have at least one element, `k` is adjusted based on whether `fav` equals the first element of `l`. If `fav` is not equal to the first element of `l`, then `k` remains less than or equal to 0. If `fav` equals the first element of `l`, then `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]` and is still greater than or equal to 0.
