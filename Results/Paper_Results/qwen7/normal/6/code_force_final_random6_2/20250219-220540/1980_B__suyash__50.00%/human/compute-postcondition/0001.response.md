State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. The loop condition `i in range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer, and it must be within the range of 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
4. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to 0 because `range(t)` generates values from 0 to `t-1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and `i` is initialized to 0.
