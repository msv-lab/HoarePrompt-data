Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly generate the shortest string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it simply repeats the first `k` lowercase letters `n` times, which does not guarantee the smallest length for `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct the shortest supersequence that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters. One approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, but for simplicity, we can construct the sequence by ensuring that each new letter added to the sequence extends the set of possible subsequences. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        # Generate the de Bruijn sequence for k symbols of length n
        def de_bruijn(k, n):
            def db(t, p):
                if t > n:
                    if n % p == 0:
                        yield ''.join(map(str, path))
                else:
                    for d in range(k):
                        path[t] = d
                        for x in db(t + 1, p + 1):
                            yield x
            path = [0] * (n + 1)
            return db(1, 1)
        
        result = ''.join(de_bruijn(k, n))
        print(result)

func()
```

This function uses a generator to create a de Bruijn sequence, which ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are included in the shortest possible string.
