Output State: The loop will have executed all iterations, meaning `i` will be equal to `t-1`. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, and the output will consist of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` repeated `n` times. The value of `t` will be the same as it was initially, and it must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.
