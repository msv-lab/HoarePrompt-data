Output State: **`temp` is [3, 3, 1], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 2) and takes the next 3 elements. Given the initial state where `temp` is `[1, 3, 3]`, the slice operation updates `temp` to `[3, 3, 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
