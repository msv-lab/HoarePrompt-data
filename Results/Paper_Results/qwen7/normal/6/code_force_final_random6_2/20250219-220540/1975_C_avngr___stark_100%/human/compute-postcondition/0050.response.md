Output State: **`temp` is [1, 3, 3], `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) and takes the next 3 elements. Given the initial state where `temp` is `[0, 1, 3]` and `i` is 1, the slice operation will take the elements from index 1 to 3 (inclusive), which are `[1, 3, 3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
