Output State: **`i` is 2, `temp` is [1, 3, 3], `max` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop or statement.**

Explanation: The line `max = 0` sets the variable `max` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
