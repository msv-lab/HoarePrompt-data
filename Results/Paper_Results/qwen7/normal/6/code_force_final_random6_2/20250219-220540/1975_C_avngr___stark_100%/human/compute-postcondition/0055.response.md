Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 2)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `temp` is [1, 3, 3]
   - `i` is 1
   - `max` remains 3 (though this variable is not directly involved in the loop head)

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, `n` is not modified.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state for the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`temp` is [1, 3, 3], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
