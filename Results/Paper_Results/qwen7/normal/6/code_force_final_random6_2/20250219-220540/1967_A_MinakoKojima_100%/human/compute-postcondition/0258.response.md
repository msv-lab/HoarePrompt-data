Postcondition: `ans` is the cumulative sum of differences added according to the conditions inside the loop plus `k // n`. `k` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the final value determined by the loop's logic, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]` since it is updated in each iteration but not stored outside the loop, `res` is increased by `k % n`.
