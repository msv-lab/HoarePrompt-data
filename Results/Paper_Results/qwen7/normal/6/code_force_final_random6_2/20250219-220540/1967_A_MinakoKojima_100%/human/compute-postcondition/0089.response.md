Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `ans * (n - 1) - n`, `res` is `-n`, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and the values of `i`, `dif`, `ans`, `res`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged from their previous values.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`, or the previously mentioned `int(input()) - 1`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and new values for `n` and `k` are introduced.
