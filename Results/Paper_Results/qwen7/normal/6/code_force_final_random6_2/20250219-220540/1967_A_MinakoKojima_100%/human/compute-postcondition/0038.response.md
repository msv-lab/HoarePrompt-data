Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -1, and `n` must be greater than 1.**

The code `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. Initially, `res` is 0, so after executing the code, `res` becomes -1. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
