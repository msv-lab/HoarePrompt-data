Output State: `ans_list` will contain the final computed value of `ans` for each iteration after all iterations of the loop have finished.

To break this down in natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `ans_list` will hold the final value of `ans` for each individual iteration. This final value of `ans` is determined by sorting the list `a`, then iteratively adjusting it based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `k`. After all such adjustments across all iterations, `ans` is further modified by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and the final value of `res`. The `res` variable tracks any remaining reductions that couldn't be fully applied due to insufficient `k` values, which gets added to `ans` at the end. Therefore, `ans_list` will contain these final values of `ans` for each iteration.
