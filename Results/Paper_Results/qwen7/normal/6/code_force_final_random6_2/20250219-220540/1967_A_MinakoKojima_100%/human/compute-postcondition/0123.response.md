Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n - 1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `dif` is not 0.
   - `res` remains -1 if `k` is 0 and `ans` is 0, or -2 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (0 + 1)`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `dif` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `res` and `ans` remain unchanged based on the given postconditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is not 0, and `res` remains -1 if `k` is 0 and `ans` is 0, or -2 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (1 + 1)`**.
