Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is 0, `res` is -1**

Explanation: The initial values of `i` and `dif` are 0. The line `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `res`. Since the initial value of `res` is not specified, we assume it to be 0 (as no other value is given). Subtracting 1 from 0 results in -1. Therefore, `res` is now -1, while `i` and `dif` remain unchanged.
