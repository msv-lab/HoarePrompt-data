Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -1 + 0 % (1 + 1), `res` is -1**

Explanation: The code `res += k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `res`. Initially, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, and `i` is 1. The expression `k % (i + 1)` evaluates to `0 % 2`, which is 0. Therefore, `res` is updated to `-1 + 0`, resulting in `res` being -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
