Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial values.
