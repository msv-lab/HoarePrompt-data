Output State: **`i` is 0; `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

Explanation: The code `dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `a[1] - a[0]`. The value of `n` is not used in this snippet, so it remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as no operation modifies it.
