Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `ans + dif`, and `res` is -3.**

Explanation: The line `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to `ans`. Since `dif` is defined as `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` is updated to its current value plus `dif`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged.
