Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers. It processes these inputs according to certain rules and returns a result for each test case.
