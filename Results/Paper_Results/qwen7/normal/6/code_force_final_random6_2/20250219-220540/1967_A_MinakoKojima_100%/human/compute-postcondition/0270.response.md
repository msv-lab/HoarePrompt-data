Based on the initial state provided, `ans_list` must contain at least one element. However, the specific value of the element in `ans_list` is not explicitly stated. Since the code snippet only accesses an element from `ans_list` without specifying an index, it implies that the code is trying to access the first element of `ans_list`.

Given that `ans_list` contains at least one element, let's denote the first element of `ans_list` as `a`. Therefore, when the code `print(a)` is executed, it will print the first element of `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is the first element of ans_list)**
