Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -2, `ans` is `a[2] - a[1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif`. Given that `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `ans` is updated to `a[2] - a[1]`. All other variables (`i`, `res`, and `dif`) retain their original values from the initial state.
