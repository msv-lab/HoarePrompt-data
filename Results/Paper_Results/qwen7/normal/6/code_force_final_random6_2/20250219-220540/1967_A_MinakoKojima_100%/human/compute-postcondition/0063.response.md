Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `k` is `-dif * 3`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, and `res` is -3**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. So, `k` is updated to `-dif * 3`. The values of `dif`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
