Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, `res` is -2, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is `ans` plus `dif`.**

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` was initially `-1`, after executing this line, `res` becomes `-2`. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
