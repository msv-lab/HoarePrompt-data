Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 0 initially, `i + 1` is 1. Therefore, `dif` is assigned the value of `a[1] - a[0]`. The condition that `i` must be less than `n - 1` is still valid, but since `i` is 0, it remains true as long as `n > 1`.
