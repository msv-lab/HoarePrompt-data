Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `dif` is not 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `res` is -1 (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `k` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `ans` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to continue.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the same as before**
