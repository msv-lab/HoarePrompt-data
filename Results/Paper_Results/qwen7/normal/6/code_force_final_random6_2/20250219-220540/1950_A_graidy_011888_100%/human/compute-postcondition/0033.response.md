Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `range(n)` and `n` can be up to 1000), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split for the last iteration of the loop. The values of `t` and `a`, `b`, `c` remain unchanged throughout the loop executions as no assignment to these variables is done within the loop body.
