Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**
