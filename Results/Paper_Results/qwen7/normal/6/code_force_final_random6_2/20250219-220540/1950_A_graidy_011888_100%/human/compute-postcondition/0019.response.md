Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.

The print statement is:

```python
print('STAIR')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'STAIR'` to the console. Since no values of `a`, `b`, or `c` are used in this print statement, they do not affect the output.

Output: **STAIR**
