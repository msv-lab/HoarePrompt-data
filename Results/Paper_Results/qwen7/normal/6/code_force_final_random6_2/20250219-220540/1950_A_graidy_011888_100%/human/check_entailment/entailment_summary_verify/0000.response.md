### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description and Expected Behavior:**
   - The problem requires determining whether three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a 'STAIR', a 'PEAK', or 'NONE'.
   - A 'STAIR' is defined as \(a < b < c\).
   - A 'PEAK' is defined as \(a < b\) and \(b > c\).
   - If none of these conditions are met, the output should be 'NONE'.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function processes a series of test cases.
   - For each test case, it checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR' if true.
   - It then checks if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\) and prints 'PEAK' if true.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

3. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the case when \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are equal (i.e., \(a == b == c\)).
   - According to the problem description, such a case should output 'NONE'.
   - The current implementation will incorrectly identify such cases as either 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' depending on the order of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - Consider the input `0 0 0`. The program should output 'NONE', but it will output 'STAIR' or 'PEAK' depending on the order, which is incorrect.
   - Consider the input `1 2 1`. The program should output 'NONE', but it will output 'PEAK' because \(1 < 2\) and \(2 > 1\), which is incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program indeed fails to handle the case where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are equal, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are equal, leading to incorrect outputs.
