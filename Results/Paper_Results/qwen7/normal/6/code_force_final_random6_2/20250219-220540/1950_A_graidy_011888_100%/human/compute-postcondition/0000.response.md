Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 1000.
