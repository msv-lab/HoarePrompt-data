### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a logical error in the peak condition check. The condition `a < b and b > c` does not correctly represent a peak. A peak should satisfy the condition `a < b > c`, which means `b` must be greater than both `a` and `c`. The current condition only checks that `b` is greater than `a` but does not ensure that `b` is also greater than `c`.

To fix this, the condition should be `a < b and b > c`. The current implementation uses `a < b and b > c`, which is incorrect because it allows for cases where `b` is greater than `a` but less than `c`, which does not constitute a peak.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment stated that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the given conditions. However, the peak condition check is incorrect due to the logical error described above. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as per the problem description.

Final: **False**
