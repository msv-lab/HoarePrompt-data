You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `position` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop performs two operations: `n >>= 1` (which means `n` is divided by 2 and truncated towards zero) and `position += 1`. Given that `n` becomes 0 after the third iteration, it implies that `n` was initially a power of 2 greater than or equal to 2^4 (since `n` became 0 after 4 divisions). Therefore, after 4 iterations, `position` will be 5, and `n` will be 0. The value of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 4



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, we need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized. However, the program only handles the case where `n > 1` and constructs the sequence `[2^counter - 1, k - (2^counter - 1), 0, ..., 0]`, which may not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 3
```

The expected output would be a sequence of three numbers that sum to 3 and maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. A valid output could be `[1, 1, 1]` because `1 | 1 | 1 = (111)_2` has three 1s, which is the maximum possible. However, the program will output `[2, 1, 0]` because it follows the logic of setting one number to `2^counter - 1` and another to `k - (2^counter - 1)`.

This example shows that the program does not always produce the optimal solution, thus it is incorrect.
