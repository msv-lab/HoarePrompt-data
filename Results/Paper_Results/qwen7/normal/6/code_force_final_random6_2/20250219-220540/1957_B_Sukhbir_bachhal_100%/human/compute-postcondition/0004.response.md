The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be equal to 0. However, right before the loop, the condition is `n` is not equal to 0. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be adjusted to be equal to 0.

State: **`position` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is 0, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9**
