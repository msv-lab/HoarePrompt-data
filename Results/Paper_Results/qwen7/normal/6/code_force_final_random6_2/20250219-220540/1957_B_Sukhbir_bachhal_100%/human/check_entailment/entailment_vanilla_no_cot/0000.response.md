Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Values**: The program only handles the case when `n > 1`. However, it should handle all cases, including when `n` is 1 or greater than 1.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` calculates the highest power of 2 less than the given number. While this is useful, it's not used correctly in the main logic. The function should be used to generate numbers that maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

3. **Incomplete Logic for Multiple Values**: When `n > 1`, the program only handles the case where `k` can be split into two parts, `2^counter - 1` and `k - (2^counter - 1)`. This does not cover all possible scenarios where `k` might need to be split differently among `n` values to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

4. **Zero Padding**: The program pads with zeros for the remaining positions, which may not always be optimal. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 7`, the correct output should be `[1, 1, 1, 2]` rather than `[3, 0, 0, 4]`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be revised to consider all possible ways to distribute `k` among `n` values to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    
    # Distribute k among n elements to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR
    for i in range(n):
        arr.append(min(k, (1 << (i + 1)) - 1))
        k -= arr[-1]
    
    print(*arr)
```

This revised program ensures that the sum of the array elements equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation by distributing the value as evenly as possible across the elements, starting from the smallest possible values.
