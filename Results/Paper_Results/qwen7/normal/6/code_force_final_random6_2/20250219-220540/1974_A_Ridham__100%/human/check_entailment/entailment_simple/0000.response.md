### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the icons.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `x` and `y` for each case.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements**:
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This correctly calculates the total space required for `x` 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This correctly calculates the total space required for `y` 2x2 icons, since each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells.

3. **Total Space Calculation**:
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x`: This sums up the total space required for both types of icons.

4. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`: This correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `y` 2x2 icons.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`: This correctly accounts for the additional screen needed when there is a remainder.

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.

6. **Checking if Remaining Space is Sufficient**:
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, so we append `screen_require_for_y` to the result.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`: This calculates the extra space required for 1x1 icons.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`: This correctly calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

7. **Appending Results**:
   - The program appends either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to the result list based on the above conditions.

8. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case, ensuring each value is on a new line.

Given the logical steps and the example provided, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
