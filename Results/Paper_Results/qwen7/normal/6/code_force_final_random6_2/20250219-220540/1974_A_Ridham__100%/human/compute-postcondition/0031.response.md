Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `result` now contains either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` depending on whether `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `n`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, and `remaining_cells` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `result` is determined based on the condition involving `space_x` and `remaining_cells`, but since the exact value of `result` depends on the inputs and the condition, it is described as containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` depending on the condition.
