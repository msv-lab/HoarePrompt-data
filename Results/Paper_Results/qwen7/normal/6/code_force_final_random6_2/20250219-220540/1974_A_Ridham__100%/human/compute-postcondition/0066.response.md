Output State: The final state of the loop will depend on the value of `n`, the number of iterations the loop runs. After all iterations, `result` will be a list containing the values calculated for each iteration according to the logic inside the loop. For each iteration, `x` and `y` are read from input, and based on the conditions provided, `screen_require_for_y` and possibly `extra_screen` are calculated. These values are then appended to `result`.

If `space_x` (which is initially `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells` (calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`), `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated and added to `screen_require_for_y`, and the sum is appended to `result`.

The final `result` will be a list of integers, each representing the calculated value for each iteration of the loop. The exact contents of `result` will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration.
