Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * (y // 2)` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1)` if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the value of `extra_space` by subtracting `remaining_cells` from `space_x`. Since `space_x` is equal to `x` and `remaining_cells` is defined based on the value of `y`, the value of `extra_space` is `x - remaining_cells`. All other variables remain unchanged.
