Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly calculates the space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and the space required for the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
3. It then calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`), which is `y // 2` if `y` is even, and `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
4. The remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
5. If there is enough remaining space to fit all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it directly uses the number of screens calculated for the 2x2 icons.
6. If there is not enough remaining space, it calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`) and adds them to the total number of screens.
7. The final results are stored in a list and printed out.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
