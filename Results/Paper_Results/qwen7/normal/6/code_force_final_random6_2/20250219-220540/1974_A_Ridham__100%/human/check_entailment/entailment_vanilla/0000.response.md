### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, which is `4y`.
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`, i.e., `x + 4y`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for `2x2` icons (`screen_require_for_y`).
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This represents the number of remaining cells after placing all `2x2` icons.
   - The logic here seems to be that each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

5. **Checking Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if `space_x` (i.e., `x`) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`.
   - If so, it directly appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result list.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons.

6. **Additional Screens Calculation**:
   - `extra_space` is the difference between `space_x` and `remaining_cells`.
   - `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`.

7. **Result Compilation**:
   - The final result is compiled and printed.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `remaining_cells`**:
   - The calculation of `remaining_cells` should consider the actual number of cells available per screen, which is 15.
   - The current logic subtracts `space_y` from `15 * screen_require_for_y`, which does not accurately reflect the available space.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space**:
   - The logic for calculating `extra_screen` assumes that the remaining space can always be perfectly divided into 15-cell blocks, which is not necessarily true.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly calculate the number of screens required, we need to:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons.
- Calculate the remaining space after placing these icons.
- Determine how many `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining space.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 1) // 2
        # Total cells used by 2x2 icons
        total_cells_2x2 = screen_require_for_y * 4
        # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - total_cells_2x2
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining cells
        if x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_icons = x - remaining_cells
            extra_screens = (extra_icons + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
            result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Conclusion:

After correcting the logic, the program should now correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the original program was incorrect due to the flawed calculations.

**Correctness: False**
