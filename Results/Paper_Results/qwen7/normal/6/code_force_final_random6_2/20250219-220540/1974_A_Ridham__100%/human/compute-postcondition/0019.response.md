Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `extra_space` which is `space_x - remaining_cells`. Given the initial conditions, `space_x` is equal to `x`, and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. Since `space_x` and `remaining_cells` are defined, `extra_space` is calculated as `x - (15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
