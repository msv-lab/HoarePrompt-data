Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - 2 * y`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1 depending on whether `y` is even or odd.
