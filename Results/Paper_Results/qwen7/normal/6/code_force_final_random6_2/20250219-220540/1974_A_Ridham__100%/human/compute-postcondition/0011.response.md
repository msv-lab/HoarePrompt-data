Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, and `y` is an odd number.**

Explanation: The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` calculates the value of `screen_require_for_y` based on the value of `y`. Since `y` is an odd number, `y // 2` (integer division) will give half of `y` rounded down, and adding 1 to that result gives the final value of `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
