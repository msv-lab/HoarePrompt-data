You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The final state of the loop will depend on the value of `n`, the number of iterations the loop runs. After all iterations, `result` will be a list containing the values calculated for each iteration according to the logic inside the loop.

These values are then appended to `result`.

Otherwise, `extra_screen` is calculated and added to `screen_require_for_y`, and the sum is appended to `result`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the icons:
     - `space_x = x * 1` (since each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell).
     - `space_y = y * 4` (since each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells).
     - `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons:
     - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons:
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Check if Remaining Space is Sufficient:**
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons:
     - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells, so the number of screens required is just the number of screens for 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`).

6. **Calculate Extra Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the extra space needed and determines how many additional screens are required:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
     - The number of extra screens required is calculated as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if there is any remainder.

7. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens required to the `result` list and prints the results at the end.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
  - The calculation of `remaining_cells` should consider that each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns). The current formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` does not correctly account for the placement of 2x2 icons across multiple screens.
  
- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space:**
  - The logic to calculate `extra_space` and `extra_screen` is flawed. The remaining space should be recalculated considering the actual placement of icons on the screens.

### Corrected Approach:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons directly without splitting into even and odd cases.
- Calculate the remaining cells on each screen after placing 2x2 icons.
- Distribute the 1x1 icons into the remaining cells on the screens.

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical errors in calculating the number of screens needed. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
