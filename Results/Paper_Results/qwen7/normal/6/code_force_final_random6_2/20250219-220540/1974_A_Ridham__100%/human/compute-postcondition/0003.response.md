Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `y`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
