Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `4 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `8 * y + 2 * x`, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd, `result` is either `screen_require_for_y` or a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` otherwise.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `remaining_cells` to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `screen_require_for_y` is determined based on whether `y` is even or odd, and `result` remains as either `screen_require_for_y` or a list containing `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on `extra_space`.
