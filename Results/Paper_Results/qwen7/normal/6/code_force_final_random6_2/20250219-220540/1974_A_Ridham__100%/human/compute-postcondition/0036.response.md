Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `2 * y`, `total_space` is equal to `7 * y + x + x`, `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - 2 * y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `space_y` is updated from `4 * y` to `2 * y` because `y` is halved (integer division) and then incremented by 1, effectively making it `2 * y`.
