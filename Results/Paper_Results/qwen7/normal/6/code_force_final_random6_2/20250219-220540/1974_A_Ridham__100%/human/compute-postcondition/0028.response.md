Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `y * 4 + x`, and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then `screen_require_for_y` is appended to the `result` list. Otherwise, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is calculated as `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if `(space_x - remaining_cells)` is not divisible by 15, otherwise it is `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15`, and `result` now contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.
