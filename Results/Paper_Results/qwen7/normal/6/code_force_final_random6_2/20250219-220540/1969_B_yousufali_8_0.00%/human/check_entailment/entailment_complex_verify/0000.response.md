### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why the assessment is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - Reads a list of integers from the user input, which is incorrect since the input is a binary string.
  - Counts the number of consecutive non-zero elements and adds `n + 1` for each occurrence where an element is 0 and there was a previous non-zero element.
  - This logic does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - Reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - This function also does not correctly handle the problem as it relies on `func_1` which is flawed.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
101011
```

- Expected output:
  ```
  9
  ```

- Actual output by the provided code:
  ```
  5
  ```

This discrepancy arises because the provided code simply counts the number of 1s and sums them up, which is not the correct approach. The correct solution would involve identifying the positions of the first and last 0s and calculating the cost of cyclic shifts accordingly.

#### Correct Solution Outline:
1. Identify the position of the first '0' from the left.
2. Identify the position of the last '0' from the right.
3. Calculate the cost of cyclic shifts needed to move all '0's to the front and all '1's to the back.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It fails to account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the binary string. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
