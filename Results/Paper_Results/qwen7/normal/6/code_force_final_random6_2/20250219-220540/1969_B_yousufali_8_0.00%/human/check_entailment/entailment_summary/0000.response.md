Reasoning:
The provided code does not actually solve the problem as described. The problem requires handling binary strings and performing cyclic shifts on substrings to sort the string in non-descending order. However, the given functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not perform any operations related to cyclic shifts or sorting binary strings.

- `func_1` reads a list of integers from the user input, which is not aligned with the problem statement where the input is a binary string.
- `func_2` calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` does not perform the required operations to solve the problem.

Given these observations, the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
