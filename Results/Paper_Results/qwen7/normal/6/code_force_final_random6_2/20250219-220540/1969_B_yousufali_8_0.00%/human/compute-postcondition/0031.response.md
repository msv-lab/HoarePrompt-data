Functionality: **The function reads a list of integers from the user input, counts the number of consecutive non-zero elements, and calculates the sum of 1 plus the count of non-zero elements immediately preceding each zero in the list. This sum is then printed as the final output. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
