Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads a list of integers from the user input, which should be a binary string converted to integers. However, the problem specifies that the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. This means `func_1()` is misinterpreting the input.
   - The function counts the number of consecutive non-zero elements and calculates the sum of 1 plus the count of non-zero elements immediately preceding each zero in the list. This logic is incorrect for solving the problem because it does not account for cyclic shifts and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

2. **Function `func_2()` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - However, since `func_1()` is incorrect, the overall solution will also be incorrect.

Given these points, the functions do not correctly solve the problem as specified. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed and does not account for the necessary operations to achieve the minimum cost for sorting the binary string through cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **False**
