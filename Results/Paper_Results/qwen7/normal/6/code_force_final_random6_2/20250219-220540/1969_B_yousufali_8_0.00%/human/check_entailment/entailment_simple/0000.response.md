Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
2. The provided solution has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` is intended to solve the problem for a single test case. It counts the number of cyclic shifts needed to move all '0's to the beginning of the string. This is done by iterating through the string and counting consecutive '1's (`n`). Whenever a '0' is encountered and `n` is non-zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`, which represents the cost of the cyclic shift.
4. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
5. The logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the cyclic shift operation. Instead, it calculates the cost of moving all '0's to the front, which is equivalent to the number of '1's plus one for each group of consecutive '0's.
6. The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

However, the problem statement specifies that the goal is to sort the string using cyclic shifts, not just to move all '0's to the front. The provided solution does not actually perform the cyclic shifts but rather calculates a cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.

Given the discrepancy between the problem's requirements and the provided solution, the program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
