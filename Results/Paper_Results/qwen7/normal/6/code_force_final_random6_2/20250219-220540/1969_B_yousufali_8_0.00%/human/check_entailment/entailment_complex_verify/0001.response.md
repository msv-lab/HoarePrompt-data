### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring that was shifted.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1()` is supposed to handle a single test case.
   - `func_2()` is supposed to handle multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

3. **`func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads a list of integers from input but does not actually use this list. Instead, it should read a single binary string.
   - It initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string (which is incorrectly treated as a list of integers).
   - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a '0' after encountering at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Issues with `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads a list of integers instead of a binary string. This will cause issues because the input should be a single string.
   - The logic to calculate the minimum cost is incorrect. The current logic does not account for the actual positions of '0's and '1's and how they need to be rearranged via cyclic shifts.

5. **Expected Correct Logic**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest prefix of '1's and then count the number of '0's that come after this prefix. The cost would be the sum of the lengths of these segments plus the length of the remaining part of the string.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly identifies that `func_1()` should read a binary string and not a list of integers.
   - However, the implementation in `func_1()` still has the issue of treating the input as a list of integers rather than a string.
   - The logic to calculate the minimum cost is still incorrect because it does not consider the positions of '0's and '1's and how they need to be rearranged via cyclic shifts.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to iterate through the string to find the longest prefix of '1's.
   - Then, we count the number of '0's that come after this prefix.
   - The cost is the sum of the lengths of these segments plus the length of the remaining part of the string.

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The annotated code correctly identifies the issues but does not provide a correct solution.

**Final: False**
