Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the problem as described. Specifically, the functions are attempting to count the number of 1s in the input, which does not solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
101011
```

Expected output:
```
9
```

However, the program will output:
```
5
```

This is because the program is counting the number of 1s and adding them up, which is not the correct approach. The correct solution involves identifying the positions of the first and last 0s and calculating the cost of cyclic shifts accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how the correct solution should work:
1. Identify the position of the first '0' from the left.
2. Identify the position of the last '0' from the right.
3. Calculate the cost of cyclic shifts needed to move all '0's to the front and all '1's to the back.

The provided code does not address these steps and thus fails to meet the problem requirements.
