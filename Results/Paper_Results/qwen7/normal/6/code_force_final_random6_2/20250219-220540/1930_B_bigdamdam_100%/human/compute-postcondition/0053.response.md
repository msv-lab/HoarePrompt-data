Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 5
   - `i` is 3
   - `p[1]` is 1
   - `p[3]` is 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1` (inclusive), with a step of 2.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3 at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 5.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ind` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` will be 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 5.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ind` is 5, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**
