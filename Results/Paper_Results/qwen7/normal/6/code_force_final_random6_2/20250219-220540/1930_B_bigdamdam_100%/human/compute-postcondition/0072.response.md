Output State: **`ind` is 6, `i` is 12, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[12]` is `8`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 8 to 6. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `p` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
