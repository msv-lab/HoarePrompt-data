Output State: **`ind` is 1, `i` is 1, `p[1]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` (which is 1) to the index `i` (which is also 1) in the list `p`. The initial values of `ind` and `i` are both 1, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged. Therefore, `p[1]` is now 1, while `ind` and `i` remain 1.
