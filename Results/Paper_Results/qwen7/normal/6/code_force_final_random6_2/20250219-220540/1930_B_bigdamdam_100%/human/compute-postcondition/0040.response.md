Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `p[0]` is `n`
   - `ind` is `n - 4`
   - `p[2]` is `n - 2`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Given `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is 2, the smallest value `n` can take for the loop to continue is 4 (since `i + 2` should be less than `n`).
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

5. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - `p[0]` remains `n`.
   - `ind` is `n - 4`, so if `n` is now 4 or greater, `ind` will be 0 or greater.
   - `p[2]` remains `n - 2`.

Given these considerations, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `p[0]` is `n`, `ind` is `n - 4`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`**
