Output State: **`n` is an input integer from the split operation, `i` is `n`, `p[i]` is `0`, `ind` is `n`, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code `ind = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ind`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` remains an input integer from the split operation, `i` is still `n`, `p[i]` is still `0` (since `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros), `ind` is now `n`, and `p` remains a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
