Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` loop statement `for i in range(0, n, 2):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is 8
   - `i` is 10
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 10
   - `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, and `p[10]` is `n-2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1` in steps of 2. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 10.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 10, the next value of `i` would be 12 (if `n` allows it).
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 10.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so it will become 12.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 10.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `ind` is 8, `i` is 12, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `p[8]` which is `n`, `p[10]` is `n-2`**
