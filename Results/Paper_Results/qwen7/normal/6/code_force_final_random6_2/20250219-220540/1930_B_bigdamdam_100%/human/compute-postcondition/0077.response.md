Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p[1]` is `ind`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the index `i` in the list `p`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `p[1]` is now `ind`. The initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
