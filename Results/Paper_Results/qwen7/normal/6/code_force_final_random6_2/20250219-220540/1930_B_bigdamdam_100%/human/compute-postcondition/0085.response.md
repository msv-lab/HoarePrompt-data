Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `ind` is `n+1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`. Given that the loop increments `ind` by 2 each time it runs, and we know the value of `ind` after 3 iterations (`ind` is 7), we can deduce that `n` must be at least 15 (since `ind` starts at 1 and increases by 2 each iteration, and after 7 iterations, `ind` would be `1 + 2*7 = 15`). Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` and `ind` will be `n+1`.
