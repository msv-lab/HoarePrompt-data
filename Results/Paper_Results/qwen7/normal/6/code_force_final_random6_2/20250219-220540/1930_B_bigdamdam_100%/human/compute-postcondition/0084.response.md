Output State: **`i` is 5; `n` must be greater than or equal to 10; `ind` is 7**

Explanation: The variable `ind` is incremented by 2, changing its value from its initial state of `ind` (which was part of the initial state) to `ind + 2`, which simplifies to 7. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
