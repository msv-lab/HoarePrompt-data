Output State: `ind` is 9, `i` is 7, `p[1]` is 1, `p[3]` is 3, `p[5]` is 5, `p[7]` is 7.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `ind` by 2 and assigns the value of `ind` to `p[i]` for each odd `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1`. Given the pattern and the fact that the loop has executed 3 times, it will continue until `i` reaches `n-1`. If `n` is at least 8 (since we've seen up to `i` being 5 after 3 iterations), then after the loop completes, `i` would be `n-1` which is 7, `ind` would be `7 + 2 = 9`, and `p` would contain the values `[n, 1, n-2, 3, n-4, 5, n-6, 7]` assuming `n` is 8.
