Postcondition: `i` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to either the sum of `max_segment[0]` and `arr[0]` if `arr[i] < 0`, or the original value of `max_segment[0]` plus the first element of `arr` if `arr[i] >= 0`. `new_segment[0]` is set to the first element of `arr` if the condition `arr[i] < 0` is false.
