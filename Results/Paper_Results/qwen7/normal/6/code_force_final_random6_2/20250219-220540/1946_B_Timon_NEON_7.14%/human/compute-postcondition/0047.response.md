Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative, `segments_variants` is a list containing the list `[max_segment + [i - 1]]`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which contains `max_segment` concatenated with `[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is either 2 or 3, `i - 1` will be either 1 or 2.
- The values of `arr`, `max_segment`, and `new_segment` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `segments_variants` now includes the newly appended list `[max_segment + [i - 1]]`.
