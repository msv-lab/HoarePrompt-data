Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either the list of segments generated during the loop's execution or `[-1]` if the length of `total_max_segment` was originally 1. The function identifies segments within `arr` where the sum of elements is maximized, considering both positive and negative contributions, and returns the segment with the maximum starting point. If no valid segments are found, it returns `[-1]`.**
