Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `segment` which iterates over `segments_variants`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `segments_variants`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `segments_variants` now contains a new list where the last element is `max_segment` followed by `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.
   - `total_max_segment` is currently `[-1]`.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since the loop depends on the existence of elements in `segments_variants`, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` is not empty.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider the initial state of `segment` when the loop starts.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `segments_variants` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The first element of `segments_variants` will be used as the initial value of `segment` in the first iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `segments_variants` must contain at least one element.
- The first element of `segments_variants` will be the initial value of `segment`.

Since `total_max_segment` is not directly involved in the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one element, and the first element of `segments_variants` will be the initial value of `segment`**.
