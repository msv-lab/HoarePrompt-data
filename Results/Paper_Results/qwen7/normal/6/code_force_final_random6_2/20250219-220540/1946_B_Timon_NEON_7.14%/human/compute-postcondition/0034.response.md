Postcondition: **`i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative, `segments_variants` is a list containing one additional element which is either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` depending on the condition of the if statement.**
