Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative, `segments_variants` is a list containing one additional element which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment variant to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment variant is formed by concatenating the `max_segment` (which is the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`) with the list `[i - 1]`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `i - 1` will be either 0 or 1. The values of `arr`, `max_segment`, and `new_segment` remain unchanged from their initial states.
