Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`, and `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is non-negative. If `arr[i]` is negative, `new_segment` remains as the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative.
