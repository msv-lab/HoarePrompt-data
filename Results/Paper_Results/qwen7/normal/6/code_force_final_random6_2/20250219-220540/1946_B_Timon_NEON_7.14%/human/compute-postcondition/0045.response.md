Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, and `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative, considering whether `new_segment` is truthy or falsy.
