Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum possible value starting from the first element of `arr`, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `arr` and 0 if the first element is non-negative, or just the first element of `arr` if the first element is negative, `segments_variants` is a list containing one additional element which is `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list. This new element is constructed by concatenating `new_segment` with `[i - 1]`. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, `i - 1` will be 0 or 1. The value of `new_segment` remains unchanged as the code only appends a new element to `segments_variants`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
