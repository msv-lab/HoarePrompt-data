Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is updated to the maximum of the original `max_segment[0]` and `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `new_segment` is an empty list, and `segments_variants` is a list containing at least one variant of the segments, either `[max_segment + [i - 1]]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `new_segment = []` initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `i`, `arr`, `max_segment[0]`, or `segments_variants`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as described in the initial state, with `new_segment` now being an empty list.
