Output State: `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` contains the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found during the execution of the loop, `segments_variants` is a list containing all possible variants of the segments that resulted in the maximum sum, and `new_segment` is an empty list if no new segment was added in the last iteration or it is a list containing the start and end indices of the last segment considered.

In this final state, `max_segment` will hold the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found throughout the entire array, and `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that contributed to this maximum sum. The variable `new_segment` will be empty if no new segment was added in the last iteration, indicating that the current maximum segment has been finalized.
