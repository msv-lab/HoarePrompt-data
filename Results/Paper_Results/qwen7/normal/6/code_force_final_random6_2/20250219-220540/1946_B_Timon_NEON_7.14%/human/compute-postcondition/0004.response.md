Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(arr))`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `0` at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the State of `arr`**: The value of `arr` is not specified in the initial state, but since the loop depends on `len(arr)`, we need to ensure that `arr` is a non-empty list. If `arr` were empty, `len(arr)` would be `0`, and the loop would not execute.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The variables `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `segments_variants` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `0`.
- `arr` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `arr` must be a non-empty list**
