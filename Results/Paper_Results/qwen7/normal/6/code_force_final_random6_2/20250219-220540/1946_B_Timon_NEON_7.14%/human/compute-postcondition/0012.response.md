Postcondition: `i` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list, and the new_segment is True. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` contains `[max_segment + [-1]]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` contains `[True, -1]`, `max_segment` remains unchanged, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0.
