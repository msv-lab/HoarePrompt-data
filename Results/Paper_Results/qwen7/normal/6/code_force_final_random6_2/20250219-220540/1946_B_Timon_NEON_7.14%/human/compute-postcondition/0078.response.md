Postcondition: `segments_variants` contains at least one element, and the first element of `segments_variants` will be the initial value of `segment`; if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.
