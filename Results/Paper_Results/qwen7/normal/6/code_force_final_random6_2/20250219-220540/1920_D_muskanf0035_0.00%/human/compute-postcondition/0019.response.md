Output State: `t` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is an input integer representing the number of operations for the last iteration, `q` is an input integer representing the number of queries for the last iteration, `queries` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers for the last iteration, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x` such that `b ∈ {1, 2}` and `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9` for the last iteration, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for the last iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will hold the total number of times the loop was executed. The final values of `n`, `q`, and `queries` will correspond to the inputs for the last iteration of the loop, while `operations` will contain the operations for that last iteration. The `result` variable will store the outcome of processing those operations and queries as defined by the `func_1` function.
