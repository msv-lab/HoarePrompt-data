n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (b, x), and queries is a list of positive integers. The operations list describes a series of append operations on an initially empty array a, where b=1 indicates appending an integer x to the end of the array, and b=2 indicates appending x copies of the current array a to itself. The queries list contains integers k_i representing the positions in the final array a for which the value needs to be determined.
