Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly simulates the operations on an initially empty array.
   - It handles both types of operations: appending a single element (type 1) and appending multiple copies of the current array (type 2).
   - After all operations are performed, it correctly retrieves the elements at the specified query positions using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the array growth.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the necessary inputs for each test case: `n`, `q`, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case and prints the results.
   - The overall logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the problem requirements. They handle the operations and queries as specified, and the code logic is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
