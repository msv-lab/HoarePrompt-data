Output State: **`queries` is a list with at least 2 elements, the first element is the second element of the previous `queries` list, `k` is the third element of the current `queries` list, `array` is unchanged, `result` is a list with three elements where the third element is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` to the `result` list. Since `result` was initially a list with two elements where the second element was `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, after appending, `result` now has three elements, with the third element being `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
