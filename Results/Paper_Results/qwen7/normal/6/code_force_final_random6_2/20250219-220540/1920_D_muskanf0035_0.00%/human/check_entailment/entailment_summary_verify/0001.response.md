### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program and the logic used. Let's break down the analysis further to ensure the program is indeed correct:

1. **Initialization and Operation Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes an empty array and processes the operations as specified. Appending elements and extending the array according to the given rules is handled accurately.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The function uses the modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` to handle queries. This approach works because:
     - The problem guarantees that the array will never be empty when handling queries.
     - The modulo operation correctly wraps around the index, ensuring that even if `k` is larger than the current length of the array, it will still point to a valid element within the current state of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly. Since the problem guarantees that there will be at least one operation of the first type before any operation of the second type, the array will never be empty when handling queries.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the query index is always valid within the current state of the array.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the results.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the necessary operations and queries as required.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description and the logic implemented in the functions.
