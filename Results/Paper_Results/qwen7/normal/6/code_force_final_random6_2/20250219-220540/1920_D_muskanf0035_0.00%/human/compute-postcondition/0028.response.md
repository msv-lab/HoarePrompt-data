Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers indicating the type of operation and the value associated with it), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the positions to query). It returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the specified indices after performing all the operations.**

This means the function processes a series of operations on an array and then retrieves specific elements from the modified array based on given queries.
