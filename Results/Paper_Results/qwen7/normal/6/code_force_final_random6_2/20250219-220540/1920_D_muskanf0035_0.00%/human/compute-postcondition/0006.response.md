Based on the initial state provided:

- `queries` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x` such that `b ∈ {1, 2}` and `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9`.
- `n` is the integer input for the number of operations.
- `q` is the integer input for the number of queries.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list unpacked, meaning it will print each element of the `result` list separated by spaces.

However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact contents of the `result` list. Therefore, the most precise description we can give is that `result` is the outcome of applying `func_1` to the inputs `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, operations, queries)**
