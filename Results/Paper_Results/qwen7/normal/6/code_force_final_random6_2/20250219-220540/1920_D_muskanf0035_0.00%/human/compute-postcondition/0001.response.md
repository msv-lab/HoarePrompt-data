State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) where c is the size of the array after performing all operations**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and does not require adjustment since it is not used within the loop.
2. The loop itself is controlled by the value of `t`, which represents the number of times the loop should execute.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute; they are part of the input data that will be processed within the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.
