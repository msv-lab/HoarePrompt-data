Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers indicating the type of operation and the value associated with it), and `queries` (a list of positive integers representing the positions to query). After performing the specified operations on an initially empty array, it returns a list `result` containing the elements from the array at the specified indices.**
