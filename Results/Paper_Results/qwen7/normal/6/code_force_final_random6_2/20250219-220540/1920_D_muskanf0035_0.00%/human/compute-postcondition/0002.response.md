Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) where c is the size of the array after performing all operations, `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `q`. The initial conditions for `t`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
