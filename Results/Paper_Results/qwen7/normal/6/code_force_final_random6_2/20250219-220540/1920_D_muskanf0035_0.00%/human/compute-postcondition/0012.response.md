Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is incremented by 1, so `t = t + 1`.
- `n` is reduced by 1, so `n = n - 1`.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `queries` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, unpacked into separate arguments. Since the exact value of `result` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the function `func_1`.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, operations, queries))**
