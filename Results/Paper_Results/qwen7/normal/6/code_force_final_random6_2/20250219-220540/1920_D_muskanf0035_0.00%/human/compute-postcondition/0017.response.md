Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `queries` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers obtained from input, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Since the function call does not specify what `func_1` does, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` will be the return value of `func_1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
