Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `operations` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x such that b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `n` is the integer input for the number of operations, `q` is the integer input for the number of queries, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact behavior or the value it returns. However, we know that `result` will be assigned the return value of `func_1`. All other variables remain in their initial states as no other assignments or changes are made to them within the given code snippet.
