### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness, especially focusing on the behavior of the modulo operation and the overall logic.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: An empty list `array` and an empty list `result` are initialized.
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation in `operations`, if the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, the value is appended to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, the entire `array` is extended by repeating itself `value` times.
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query `k` in `queries`, the `k`-th element of `array` (considering 1-based indexing) is computed using `(k - 1) % len(array)` and appended to `result`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q` are read.
   - The operations are read and stored in a list of lists `operations`.
   - The queries are read and stored in a list `queries`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments.
   - The result from `func_1` is printed.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles appending elements and extending the array as specified.
   - The logic for extending the array by repeating itself `value` times is correct and ensures the array grows as required.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)` is used to find the `k`-th element in the array. This operation is correct because:
     - The array is always non-empty due to the guarantee that there is at least one operation of the first type before any operation of the second type.
     - The modulo operation ensures that the index wraps around correctly, even if `k` is larger than the current length of the array.
     - The length of the array increases exponentially with each operation of the second type, ensuring that the modulo operation will always point to a valid element in the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem constraints ensure that the array will never be empty when handling queries.
   - The modulo operation will always correctly handle the wrapping around of indices, even for very large values of `k`.

### Conclusion

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly handles the operations and queries as specified. The modulo operation ensures that the queries are handled correctly, even when `k` is larger than the current length of the array.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
