Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `t > 0`: This condition is not directly relevant to the calculation of `ans`.
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `m` is at least 5.
   - `count` is initially 6.
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     ans = n + \frac{n}{4} / 2 - \frac{1}{4} + \left(\frac{n}{4} - 1\right) / 4 + 1 + \frac{g}{5} + 1
     \]
     where \( g = \frac{n}{5} - 1 \).
   - `countmins` is 4.
   - `g` is calculated as \( \frac{n}{5} - 1 \).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m`.
   - After 3 iterations, `count` is 5.
   - For the loop to complete all iterations, `m` must be at least 5.
   - In the final iteration, `count` becomes 6.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - Let's assume `n` is an integer, say `n = 20` (since it's not specified, we can choose a value to illustrate the calculation).
   - Calculate `g`:
     \[
     g = \frac{20}{5} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
     \]
   - Substitute `n` and `g` into the formula for `ans`:
     \[
     ans = 20 + \frac{20}{4} / 2 - \frac{1}{4} + \left(\frac{20}{4} - 1\right) / 4 + 1 + \frac{3}{5} + 1
     \]
     Simplify the expression step by step:
     \[
     ans = 20 + 5 / 2 - \frac{1}{4} + (5 - 1) / 4 + 1 + \frac{3}{5} + 1
     \]
     \[
     ans = 20 + 2.5 - 0.25 + 1 + 0.75 + 1
     \]
     \[
     ans = 20 + 2.5 - 0.25 + 1 + 0.75 + 1 = 24
     \]

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(int(ans))` statement will print the integer value of `ans`.

Output: **24**
