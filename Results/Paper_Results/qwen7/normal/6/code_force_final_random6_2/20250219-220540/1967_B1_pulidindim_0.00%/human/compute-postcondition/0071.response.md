Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series where each term is `g / count + 1` starting from `n / 2 - 3` and decreasing by `1 / count` for each subsequent iteration until `count` equals `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / (m + 1) - m`.

To explain this in simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of a series of terms. Each term in the series is calculated as `g / count + 1`, where `g` starts as `n / 2 - 3` and decreases by `1 / count` with each iteration. The loop continues until `count` reaches `m + 1`. The variable `countmins` is set to `m`, and `g` is updated to `n / (m + 1) - m` at the end of the last iteration.
