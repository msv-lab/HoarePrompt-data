Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 0, the value of `g` is less than `countmins`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional structure that was being executed. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or conditional block has been exited.
