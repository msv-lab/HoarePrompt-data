Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is 5, `ans` is equal to `n` + `n` / 4 / 2 - 1 / 4 + 2 + `g` / 4 + 1, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n` / 4 - 1**.

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
