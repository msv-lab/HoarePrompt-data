Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) does not match the problem statement's requirements.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The given code attempts to increment `ans` by a calculated value but does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**: The problem requires checking each pair \((a, b)\) within the specified ranges and verifying the condition. The current implementation does not perform this check for every pair.

To correctly solve this problem, you should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This solution iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly.
