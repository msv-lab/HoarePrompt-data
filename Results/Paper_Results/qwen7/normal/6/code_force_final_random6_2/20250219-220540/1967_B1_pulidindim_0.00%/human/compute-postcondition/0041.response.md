The code `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the value of `ans` is initially calculated as `n + n / 4 / 2 - 1 / 4 + (n / 4 - 1) / 4 + 1 + g / 5 + 1`. Since `g` is defined as `n / 5 - 1`, we can substitute `g` in the expression for `ans`.

Let's simplify the expression for `ans`:

1. Calculate `g`: `g = n / 5 - 1`
2. Substitute `g` into the expression for `ans`: 
   \[
   ans = n + n / 4 / 2 - 1 / 4 + (n / 4 - 1) / 4 + 1 + (n / 5 - 1) / 5 + 1
   \]
3. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   ans = n + n / 8 - 1 / 4 + (n / 16 - 1 / 4) + 1 + (n / 25 - 1 / 5) + 1
   \]
   \[
   ans = n + n / 8 - 1 / 4 + n / 16 - 1 / 4 + 1 + n / 25 - 1 / 5 + 1
   \]
   \[
   ans = n + n / 8 + n / 16 + n / 25 - 1 / 4 - 1 / 4 - 1 / 5 + 2
   \]

Since `ans` is now assigned the value of `n`, the expression simplifies to just `n`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `n / 5 - 1**
