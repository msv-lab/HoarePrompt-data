Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function verifies that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n and m does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function returns whether each test case meets these conditions.**
