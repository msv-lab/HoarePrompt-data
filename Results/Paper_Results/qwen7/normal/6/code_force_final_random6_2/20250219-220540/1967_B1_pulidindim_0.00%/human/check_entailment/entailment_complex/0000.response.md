Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Count Calculation**: The variable `count` is initialized to 2. This seems to be an attempt to calculate something related to the conditions of the problem, but the logic is flawed. The correct approach should involve checking pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m` and ensuring that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The current logic inside the `while` loop is not aligned with the problem statement. It attempts to increment `ans` by a fraction of `n` divided by `count` plus one, which does not correctly implement the required condition. Specifically, the calculation `g = n / count` and subsequent operations do not reflect the necessary checks for the gcd condition.

4. **GCD Condition Missing**: The code does not actually check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair `(a, b)`. Instead, it uses a heuristic that does not guarantee correctness.

5. **Output**: The final output is printed as an integer, which is correct since the problem asks for the number of valid pairs.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The logic for counting valid pairs is fundamentally flawed and does not adhere to the required conditions.

Correctness: **False**
