Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `t` is 2**.

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 2 because the condition `if a + b` is even, no changes are made to `t`. The initial state of `t` being 2 is preserved unless the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, which is not specified to change `t` in the given code.
