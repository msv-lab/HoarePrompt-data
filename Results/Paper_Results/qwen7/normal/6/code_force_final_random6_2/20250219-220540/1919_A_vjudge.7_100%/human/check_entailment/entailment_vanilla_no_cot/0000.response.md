Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Hereâ€™s why the logic works:

1. **Game Analysis**: 
   - Each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their own wallet.
   - The key observation is that the game essentially reduces the total number of coins by one per turn until one player cannot make a move.
   - If the initial total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves (swap or not swap) to ensure he is the last player to make a move when the total number of coins becomes odd.
   - Conversely, if the initial total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a situation where he cannot make a valid move when the total number of coins becomes even.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

This logic aligns perfectly with the game's rules and ensures the correct determination of the winner based on the initial conditions. Therefore, the given program is correct.
