Output State: **`a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user, `test` must be at least 1, `t` is 1, `a` and `b` are now the integers obtained from the input split by space**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts separated by a space, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `test` and `t` remain unchanged.
