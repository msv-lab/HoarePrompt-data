Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(num) - 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
   - `counter` is 2 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` also equals '0'.
   - `counter` is 1 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` does not equal '0'.
   - `counter` remains 0 if `num[len(num) - 1]` does not equal '0'.
   - `i` is -1 and the loop breaks out.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from its current value. Since `i` is -1 now, it cannot be decremented further within the loop. Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the condition `len(num) - 1 > i` will no longer be true.

5. **Final State**: Given that the loop will not execute again, the state remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`counter` is 2 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` also equals '0'. Otherwise, `counter` is 1 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` does not equal '0', or `counter` remains 0 if `num[len(num) - 1]` does not equal '0'. In either case, `i` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
