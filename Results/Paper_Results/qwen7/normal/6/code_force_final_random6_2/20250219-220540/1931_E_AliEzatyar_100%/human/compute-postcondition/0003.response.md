Output State: **`counter` is 1, `num` is a sequence-like object with a length greater than 0, `i` is initialized to `len(num) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` is 0, so after executing this line, `counter` becomes 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
