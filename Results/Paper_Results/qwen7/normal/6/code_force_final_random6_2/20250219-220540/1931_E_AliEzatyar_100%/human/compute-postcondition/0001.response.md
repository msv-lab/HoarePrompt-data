Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(num) - 1, -1, -1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `len(num) - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `len(num) - 1` for the loop to start.

3. **Determine the state of `num`**: The value of `num` must be such that `len(num)` is valid and non-negative. Since `num` is an integer, `len(num)` is not applicable as integers do not have a length. Instead, we should consider the context where `num` might be a sequence (like a string or a list). However, based on the given information, we assume `num` is an integer, and we need to ensure that `len(num)` is meaningful in the context of the loop, which implies `num` should be a sequence-like object (e.g., a string or a list).

4. **Loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i >= 0`. Therefore, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `num` (assuming `num` is a sequence-like object) to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `counter` is 0 (unchanged)
- `num` must be a sequence-like object (e.g., a string or a list) with a length greater than 0, so `i` can start from `len(num) - 1` and decrement until it reaches 0.
- `i` must be initialized to `len(num) - 1` for the loop to start.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`counter` is 0, `num` must be a sequence-like object with a length greater than 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
