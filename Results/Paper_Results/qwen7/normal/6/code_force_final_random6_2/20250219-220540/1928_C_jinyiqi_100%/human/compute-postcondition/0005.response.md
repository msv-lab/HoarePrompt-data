Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `output1` is a list containing 1 element which is `i`, `output2` is a list containing 1 element which is `int(x / i)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Given that `i` is 2, `output2` now contains the integer division of `x` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
