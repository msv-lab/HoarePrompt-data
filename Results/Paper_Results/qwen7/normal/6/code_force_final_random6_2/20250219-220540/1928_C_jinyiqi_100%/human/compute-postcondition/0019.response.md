Output State: **The program returns a list that combines the quotients from the division of `x` by its divisors (in descending order) with the divisors themselves (also in descending order).**

This means the returned list starts with the largest quotient followed by the largest divisor, then the second-largest quotient followed by the second-largest divisor, and so on until all quotients and divisors are included in the combined list.
