You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list. This list contains the divisors of `x` in descending order, followed by their corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by these divisors, also in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even.
     - If `(n + x - 2)` is even, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` to find all divisors of `(n + x - 2)`.
     - If `(n - x)` is even, it calls `func_1(n - x)` to find all divisors of `(n - x)`.

3. **Filtering Divisors:**
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.

4. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.

5. **Printing Result:**
   - The length of the `output` list is printed, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that the total number of positions considered is even, which aligns with the problem statement where the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - Similarly, `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensures that the starting point is correctly aligned with the settling pattern.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(x)` correctly calculates all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - The logic in the main loop to filter valid `k` values is also correct.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The filtering logic ensures that only those `k` values are considered which satisfy the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
