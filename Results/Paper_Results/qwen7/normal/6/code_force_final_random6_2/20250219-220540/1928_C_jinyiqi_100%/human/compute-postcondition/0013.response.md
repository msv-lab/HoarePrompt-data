Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `output1` is a list containing 3 elements `[3, 3, 4], `output2` remains an empty list**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `output1`. Initially, `output1` contains `[3, 3]`. After appending `i`, `output1` becomes `[3, 3, 4]`. The value of `x`, `i`, and the condition for `output2` remain unchanged, so `output2` stays as an empty list.
