Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` in descending order, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotients in descending order.**

Explanation: The line `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1` in-place, changing its order from ascending to descending. The list `output2` remains unchanged because it was not modified by this command. Therefore, `output1` now contains the divisors of `x` in descending order, and `output2` still contains the corresponding quotients in descending order.
