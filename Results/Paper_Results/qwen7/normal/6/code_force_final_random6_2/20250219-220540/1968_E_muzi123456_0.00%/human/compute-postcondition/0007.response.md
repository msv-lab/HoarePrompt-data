Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n`).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
