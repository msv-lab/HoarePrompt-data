The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a line containing `n` occurrences of '1' followed by the integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0, `n` retains its original value from the last test case, and `i` is equal to `n`.
