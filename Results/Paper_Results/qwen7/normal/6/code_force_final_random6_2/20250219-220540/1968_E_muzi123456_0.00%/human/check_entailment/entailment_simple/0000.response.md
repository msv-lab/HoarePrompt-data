Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid.
2. The annotated program iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints out coordinates in a specific pattern.
3. The pattern printed is:
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it prints the coordinate (1, i).
4. This pattern ensures that the Manhattan distances between the points are maximized. Specifically:
   - The distance between any two points (1, i) and (1, j) where \( i \neq j \) is \( |i - j| \).
   - The maximum distance between any two points in this configuration is \( n - 1 \).
5. Given the constraints \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \), this approach guarantees that the set of distinct Manhattan distances includes values from 0 to \( n - 1 \), thus maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
