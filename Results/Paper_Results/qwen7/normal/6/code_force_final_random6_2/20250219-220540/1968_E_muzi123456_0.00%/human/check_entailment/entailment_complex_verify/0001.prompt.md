You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` remains as the original input integer, `i` is equal to `n`.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by `n` after each full iteration of the loop, and `n` is the number of iterations. The variable `n` remains as the original input integer because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive, and the last value `i` takes is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a line containing `n` occurrences of '1' followed by the integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0, `n` retains its original value from the last test case, and `i` is equal to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, the function prints a series of coordinates where the first coordinate is always 1 and the second coordinate ranges from 1 to \(n\).
4. This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, for \(n=2\), the output would be:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   ```
   The Manhattan distances are 0 and 1, so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct but not necessarily the maximum possible set of distances for larger \(n\).

5. The examples in the problem statement show more complex arrangements that achieve a larger \(\mathcal{H}\) for larger \(n\). The provided function does not generate such arrangements.

Given the requirement to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the provided function does not meet the criteria because it only prints a simple pattern that does not necessarily maximize the set of distances.
