Output State: `t` is 0, `n` remains as the original input integer, `i` is equal to `n`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by `n` after each full cycle of the loop, and `n` is the number of iterations. The variable `n` remains as the original input integer because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive, and after all iterations, `i` will reach `n`.
