Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all given \(n\). For instance, consider \(n = 3\):

The program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include cells that provide a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. As per the problem description and the example given, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This arrangement provides the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is larger than what the current program outputs. Therefore, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) and hence is incorrect.
