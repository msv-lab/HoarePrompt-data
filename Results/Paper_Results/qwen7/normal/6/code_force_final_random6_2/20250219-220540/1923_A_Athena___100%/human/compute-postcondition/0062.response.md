Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 1, `i` is 2, and the current value of `a[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially 0, after executing this line, `res` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
