Reasoning:
- The problem requires moving chips to form a single block with the minimum number of operations.
- The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list but does not account for the actual movement of chips to achieve the desired configuration.
- The count of trailing zeros removed is not relevant to the solution since the goal is to move chips to adjacent positions, not just remove zeros.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
