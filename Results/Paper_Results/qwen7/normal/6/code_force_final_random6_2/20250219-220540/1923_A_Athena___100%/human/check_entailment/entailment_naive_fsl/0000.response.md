Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The program simply counts the number of free cells at the end of the list after removing leading and trailing free cells. This approach does not account for the fact that chips can only be moved to the closest free cell to the left, and it does not consider the optimal strategy for minimizing the number of operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The expected output is `1`, as moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell achieves the goal. However, the program incorrectly outputs `4` because it simply counts the number of free cells at the end of the list after removing leading and trailing free cells.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the number of free cells between consecutive chips. The number of operations required is the maximum of the number of free cells between chips plus one (to account for the initial position of the chips).
