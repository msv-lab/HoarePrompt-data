Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is non-empty and `a[-1]` is not 0, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Initially, `a[-1]` was 0, but now it is no longer 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
