Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left to form a single block of chips. However, the given code simply counts the number of trailing zeros in the list `a`, which represents the positions of the chips. This approach does not account for the movement of chips to the left.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the left until they form a single block. Here's how we can do it:

1. Identify the positions of all chips.
2. For each chip, calculate the distance to the nearest free cell to the left.
3. Sum these distances to get the minimum number of operations required.

Let's analyze the given annotated program:

- The program removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`.
- It then counts the number of trailing zeros, which is not relevant to the problem.

This approach does not simulate the actual movement of chips and thus does not provide the correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
