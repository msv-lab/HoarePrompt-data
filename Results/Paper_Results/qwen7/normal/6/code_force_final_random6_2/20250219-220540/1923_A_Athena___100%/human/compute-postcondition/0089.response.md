Output State: **The list `a` has been modified such that it no longer contains any leading zeros and now has one fewer element, with the last element being 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that the last element of the list `a` must be 0, after executing `a.pop()`, the list will have one fewer element, and the condition about not containing any leading zeros remains unchanged.
