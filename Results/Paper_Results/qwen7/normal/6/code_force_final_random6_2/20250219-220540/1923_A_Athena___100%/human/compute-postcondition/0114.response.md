Output State: The list `a` has had all its trailing zeros removed, and the variable `res` contains the total count of trailing zeros that were removed.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `res` will be the total count of trailing zeros in the list `a`. The loop processes each input list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros. Since the loop runs until all elements are processed, `res` will hold the count of trailing zeros that were present in the original list `a`.
