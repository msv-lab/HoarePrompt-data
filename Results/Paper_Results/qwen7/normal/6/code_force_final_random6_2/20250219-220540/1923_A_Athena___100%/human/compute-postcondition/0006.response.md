Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, the first element of `a` is removed, `res` is 0**.

The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from list `a`. Since the first element of `a` must be 0, after executing this line, the first element is no longer present in the list. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
