Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element that was 0 but now does not contain 0, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` must have at least one element that is 0 at the end of the list, after popping, the list no longer contains 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
