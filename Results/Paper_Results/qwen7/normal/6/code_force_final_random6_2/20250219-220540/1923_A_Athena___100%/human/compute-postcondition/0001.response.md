State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it should iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, so `t` must also be within this range.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute, which means `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
