Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while a and a[-1] == 0:`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as the list `a` is not empty (`a`) and the last element of the list is `0` (`a[-1] == 0`).

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The list `a` has been modified such that it no longer contains any leading zeros and now has one fewer element, with the last element being `0`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     1. The list `a` must not be empty.
     2. The last element of the list `a` must be `0`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the last element of `a` is `0`, the second condition is already satisfied.
   - However, the list `a` now has one fewer element, meaning it could potentially be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the list `a` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **The list `a` must have at least one element and the last element must be 0**.
