Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` has at least one element, and `res` is 2** 

Explanation: The variable `res` was incremented by 1, starting from its initial value which is assumed to be 1 (since it remains unchanged and no other value is given). Therefore, `res` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged.
