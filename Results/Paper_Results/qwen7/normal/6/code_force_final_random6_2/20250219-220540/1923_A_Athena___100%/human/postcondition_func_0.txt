The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the list), and a list of n integers representing cells (0 for free, 1 for containing a chip). It removes all leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the number of trailing zeros removed. The function then prints this count for each test case. If no cells contain a chip (all values are 0), it does not return any specific value for that case.
