Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and splits them based on whitespace, converting each to an integer and assigning them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial conditions for `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
