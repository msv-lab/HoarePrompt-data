Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the new last element in `lst[x]` after popping the previous `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` simply assigns the current value of `y` to `x`. This does not change the value of `y` itself, nor does it affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `s`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were initially described, with `x` now being equal to `y` and `y` being the new last element in `lst[x]` after popping the previous `y`.
