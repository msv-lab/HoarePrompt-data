Output State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\), the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\), `a` is the first integer input from the user, `b` is the second integer input from the user, and both are integers, and `lst[b]` now includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list located at index `b` in the list `lst`. This does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the conditions and values of all other variables remain unchanged, and only the list `lst` at index `b` has been modified to include `a`.
