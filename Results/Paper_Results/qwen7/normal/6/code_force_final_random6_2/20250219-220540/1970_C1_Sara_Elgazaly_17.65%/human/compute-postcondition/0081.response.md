Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `s` is `False`.
   - `x` is equal to `y`.
   - `y` is the last remaining element in `lst[x]` after all possible pops.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `t` is `1`.
   - `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\).
   - The list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer \(u_1\) such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\).
   - `a` and `b` are integers that are inputs to the loop, with `a` being the first integer and `b` being the second integer from each input pair.
   - `lst` is a `defaultdict` where all values are lists.
   - `s` is now `False` after the loop has terminated.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('Hermione' if s else 'Ron')`.

Given that `s` is `False` (as explicitly stated in the initial state and confirmed by the loop termination condition), the expression `'Hermione' if s else 'Ron'` evaluates to `'Ron'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **Ron**
