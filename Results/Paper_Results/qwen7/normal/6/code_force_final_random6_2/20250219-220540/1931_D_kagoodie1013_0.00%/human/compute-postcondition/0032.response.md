Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `test_cases`, where each `test_case` is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `n`: This is the first element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `x`: This is the second element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `y`: This is the third element of the tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr`: This is the fourth element of the tuple in `test_cases`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `arr` retains its initial list of tuples, it does not change from the previous iteration.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` will be set to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `results` contains the final value of `count`.
- `count` reflects the cumulative sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` for every `num` in `arr`.
- `mod_x_map` contains the frequency of each modulus result for `x` across all elements in `arr`.
- `mod_y_map` contains the frequency of each modulus result for `y` across all elements in `arr`.
- `arr` retains its initial list of tuples.
- `num` is the last element processed in `arr`.

For the next iteration, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` will be the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `results` will be the value of `count` from the previous iteration.
- `count` will be reset to 0 for the new iteration.
- `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will be reset to their initial states.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`results` contains the final value of `count` from the previous iteration, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is reset, `mod_y_map` is reset, `arr` retains its initial list of tuples, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`**.

However, since the exact values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next tuple are not provided, we can only specify the general form:

State: **`results` contains the final value of `count` from the previous iteration, `count` is 0, `mod_x_map` is reset, `mod_y_map` is reset, `arr` retains its initial list of tuples, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases`**.
