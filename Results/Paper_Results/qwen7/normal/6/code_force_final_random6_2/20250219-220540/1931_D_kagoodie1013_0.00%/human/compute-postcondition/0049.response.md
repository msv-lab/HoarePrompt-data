Output State: **`count` is 3, `arr` is a non-empty list that does not contain the first element, `num` is the second element in the list, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is 1, `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code `mod_y_key = num % y` simply reassigns the value of `mod_y_key` to be the result of `num % y`. Since `num` is the second element in the list `arr`, `mod_y_key` is already defined as `num % y`. Therefore, the value of `mod_y_key` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values.
