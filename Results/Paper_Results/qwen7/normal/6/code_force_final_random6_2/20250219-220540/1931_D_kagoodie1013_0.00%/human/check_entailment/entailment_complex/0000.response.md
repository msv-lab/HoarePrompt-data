Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on specific conditions involving the sum and difference of pairs of elements being divisible by given integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes them one by one.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs using a hashmap-based approach to count the frequency of remainders when array elements are divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
   - The logic for calculating the number of beautiful pairs is correct:
     - For each element in the array, compute its remainder when divided by \(x\) and \(y\).
     - Use these remainders to find the number of previous elements that would form a beautiful pair with the current element.
     - Update the frequency maps accordingly.
3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly, with the sum of \(n\) over all test cases not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - The code correctly processes each test case independently and accumulates the results.
4. **Functionality Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find beautiful pairs and returns the expected results.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
