Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_x = -num % x` calculates the value of `mod_x` as `-num % x`. The values of `count`, `arr`, `num`, `mod_y_map`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
