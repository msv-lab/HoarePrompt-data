Output State: **`count` is `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2 + 1 + 3, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`**.

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `mod_x_map` by incrementing the count of `mod_x_key` by 1. Since `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0)` returns the current count of `mod_x_key` (which is 0 initially), adding 1 to it results in 1. Therefore, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
