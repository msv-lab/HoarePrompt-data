Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on values from the iterable `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. Each element of `arr` is a tuple, and `num` will take on the value of each element in this tuple one by one.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` will take on the value of elements from `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The initial state of `num` is not specified, but it will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must not be empty.
- `num` will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the first element of `arr`**.
