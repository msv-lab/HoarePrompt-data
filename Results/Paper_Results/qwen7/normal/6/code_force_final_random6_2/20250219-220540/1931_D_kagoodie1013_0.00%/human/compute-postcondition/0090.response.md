Output State: **`count` is `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2 + 1 + 3, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 4, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` by adding 1 to its current value (which was initially 3). Therefore, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` now equals 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
