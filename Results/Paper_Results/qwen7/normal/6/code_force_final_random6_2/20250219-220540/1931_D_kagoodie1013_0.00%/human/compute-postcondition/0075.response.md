Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `count` is `num % y` + 0
   - `arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element
   - `num` is the first element of `arr`
   - `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`
   - `mod_y_key` is `num % y`

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the first element of `arr`.
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be the second element of `arr`.
   - The list `arr` will now have one less element because the first element (current `num`) has been processed.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `count` will be updated based on the new `num`, but since the exact loop body is omitted, we cannot determine its exact value yet.
   - `arr` will now be a list with at least one element (the second element from the original list).
   - `num` will be the second element of the updated `arr`.
   - `mod_y_map` and `mod_y_key` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
   - `results` remains the same as it contains the final value of `count` from the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`count` is `num % y` + 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_y_key` is `num % y`**
