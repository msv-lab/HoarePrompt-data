Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `test_cases`, which means it will execute once for each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `n`: This is the first element of the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. It remains unchanged within the loop and is initialized from `test_cases`.
   - `x`: This is the second element of the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. It remains unchanged within the loop and is initialized from `test_cases`.
   - `y`: This is the third element of the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. It remains unchanged within the loop and is initialized from `test_cases`.
   - `arr`: This is the fourth element of the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. It is the list that changes during the loop execution.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries where keys are the possible remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and values are the counts of these remainders.
- `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` values and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for each `num` in `arr`.
- `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `arr` needs to be updated with the next tuple from `test_cases`. Therefore, `arr` will contain the elements of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Since the other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) are not modified within the loop, they retain their initial values from the current tuple in `test_cases`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list (containing the elements of the next tuple in `test_cases`), `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries where keys are the possible remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and values are the counts of these remainders, `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` values and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for each `num` in `arr`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`**.
