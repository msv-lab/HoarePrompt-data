Output State: **`count` is `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x = -next_num % x`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_key` is `next_num`**.

Explanation: The line `mod_y = num % y` calculates the modulus of `num` with `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `mod_y` is dependent on the values of `num` and `y`.
