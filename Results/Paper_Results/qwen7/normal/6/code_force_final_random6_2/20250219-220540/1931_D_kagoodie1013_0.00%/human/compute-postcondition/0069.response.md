Output State: **`count` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_y` which is the remainder when `num` (the first element of `arr`) is divided by `y`. The value of `count` remains unchanged at 0, `arr` remains a non-empty list with its first element being `num`, `mod_y_map` remains an empty dictionary, and `results` remains a list containing the final value of `count` which is 0. The new variable `mod_y` is added with the value of `num % y`.
