Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 2`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, and if `ul` equals `ur`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `2 * n`, `ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]`, and the condition `if ul == ur` remain unchanged from their initial states.
