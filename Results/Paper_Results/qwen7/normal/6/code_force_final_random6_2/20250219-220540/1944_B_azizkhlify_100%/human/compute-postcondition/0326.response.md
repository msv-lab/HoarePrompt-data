Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 1, `res` is a list containing one additional element which is `a[i]`, and the condition `re == k` is true. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change any of the variable values but indicates that we are breaking out of the loop or conditional block we are currently inside. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
