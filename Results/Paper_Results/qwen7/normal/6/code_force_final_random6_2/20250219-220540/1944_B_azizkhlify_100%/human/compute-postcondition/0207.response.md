Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `2 * n + 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either `1` or has not been checked.
   - `res` is a list that contains the element `a[i]` under certain conditions.
   - `re` is a counter that is incremented by `1` each time a condition is met.
   - The condition for adding `a[i]` to `res` is that `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1` and `re == k`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the value of `a[i]`:
- Since `i` is defined as `2 * n + 1`, it is an integer.
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space (`end=' '`).

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the index `i` and the list `a`.

Output: **a[2 * n + 1]**
