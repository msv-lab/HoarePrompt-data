Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either `1` or has not been checked, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to `1` and the condition `(re == k)` is true, `re` is incremented by `1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. This means that the operations inside that loop or if statement are not executed further. Since no changes are made to the variables outside of that scope, the values of `i`, `a`, `l`, `res`, and `re` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
