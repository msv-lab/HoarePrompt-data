Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `re` is 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `res` is a list containing the elements `a[0]` and `a[i]`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 1, then `res` remains unchanged as a list containing the element `a[0]`.
