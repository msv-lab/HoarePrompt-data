Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than `n`
- `n` must be greater than 6
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1
- The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2

We need to determine the value of `a[i]`. Since `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 and `l[a[i] - 1]` is currently 2, it implies that `a[i] - 1` is an index in the arrays `r` and `l`. However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not directly provided, but we know that `a[i] - 1` corresponds to an index where `l` has a value of 2.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` without more context, but we can infer that `a[i]` is an integer such that `a[i] - 1` is an index where `l` has a value of 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
