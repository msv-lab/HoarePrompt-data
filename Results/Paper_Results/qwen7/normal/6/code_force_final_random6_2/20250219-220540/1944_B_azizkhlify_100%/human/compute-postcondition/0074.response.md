Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `re` is `re_prev + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the condition for appending to the list `res` was being checked. The values of `n`, `i`, and `re` remain unchanged from their previous states, and we simply break out of the loop or conditional block.
