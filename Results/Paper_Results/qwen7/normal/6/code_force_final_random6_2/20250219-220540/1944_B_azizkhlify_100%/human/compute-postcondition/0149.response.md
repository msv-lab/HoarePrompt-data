Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`.

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be in the range `[n, 2 * n)`.
   - Since `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` needs to be updated based on the new value of `i`. Since `i` is now `n + 1`, `a[i]` would be `a[n + 1]`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` would be `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`. However, since we are only asked to update the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to know the exact value of `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, but we need to ensure that the condition for the loop to continue is met.

5. **Final State:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged).
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is yet to be incremented (since we don't know the exact value of `a[n + 1]`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.
