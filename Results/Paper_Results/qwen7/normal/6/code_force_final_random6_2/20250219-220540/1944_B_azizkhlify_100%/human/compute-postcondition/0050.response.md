Output State: **`i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `ul` is `z + 4`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `ul`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, these values remain unchanged from their initial states.
