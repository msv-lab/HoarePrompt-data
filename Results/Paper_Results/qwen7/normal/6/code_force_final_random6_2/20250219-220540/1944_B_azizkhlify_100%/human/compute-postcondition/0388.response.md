Postcondition: `res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n + 2`, and if the condition `ul == ur` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `ul == ur` is false, no changes are made to the variables.
