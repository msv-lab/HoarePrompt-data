Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is already defined as `n + 1`, it remains unchanged. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented based on the current value of `a[i]`, which is `a[n + 1]`. However, since the exact value of `a[n + 1]` is not specified, we keep it as `a[i]` and note that it is incremented by 1.
