Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged, `2 * n` is unchanged, `ur` is `ur + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `ur`, it is updated to `ur + 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `2 * n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
