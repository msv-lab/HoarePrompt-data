Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `2 * n`: This means `i` is twice the value of `n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or has not been checked. This implies that `l[a[i] - 1]` could be 1 or any other value (typically 0 or None).
   - `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 and the condition `(re == k)` is true. If `(re == k)` is false, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

Given this information, let's determine what will be printed:

- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- Since `i` is `2 * n`, `a[i]` is the element at index `2 * n` in the list `a`.

The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]`, which is `a[2 * n]`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of the element at index `2 * n` in the list `a`.

Output: **a[2 * n]**
