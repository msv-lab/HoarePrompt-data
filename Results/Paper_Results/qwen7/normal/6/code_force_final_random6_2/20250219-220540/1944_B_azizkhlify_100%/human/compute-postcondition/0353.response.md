Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements of `a` up to index `i`.

The variable `i` represents the index up to which the elements of list `a` have been included in the list `res`. Since `res` contains elements from the list `a` up to index `i`, it means that `i` is the length of the list `res`.

When the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **i (where i is the length of the list res)**
