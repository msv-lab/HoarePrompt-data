Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of integers where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 1, and `res` is a list containing one additional element which is `a[i]`. If the condition `re == k` is true, then `res` is updated with `a[i]`.
