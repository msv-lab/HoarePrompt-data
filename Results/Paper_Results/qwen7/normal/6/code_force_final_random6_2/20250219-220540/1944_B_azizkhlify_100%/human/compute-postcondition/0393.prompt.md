Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `2 * n`, `n` remains unchanged, `2 * n` remains unchanged, `ur` will be `2 * n - 2 * k`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` will be set to `0`. The loop will terminate when `ul` equals `ur`, meaning it will print each element `a[i]` twice and set `r[a[i] - 1]` to `0` until the count of printed elements matches the count of elements satisfying the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `res` list remains empty, `ul` is incremented by 6, `ur` is incremented by 6, and `i` is 3. The loop continues to execute as long as `ul` does not equal `ur`. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop will break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The variable `res` still contains all the elements of the list `a`. The variable `ul` is equal to `ur` plus twice the number of iterations the loop has executed. The variable `i` is equal to `n` plus the total number of iterations the loop has executed. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks early.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
