Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts from `i = n` and ends at `i = 2 * n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

2. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given `i` is `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, it will increment to `n + 2` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the new state of `i` should be `n + 2`.

### Final State
- `i` will be `n + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no further operations are specified.

### Updated State
State: **`i` is `n + 2`**
