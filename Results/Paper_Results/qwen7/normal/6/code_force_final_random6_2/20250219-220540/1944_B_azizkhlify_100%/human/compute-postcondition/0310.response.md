Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `ul + 4`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the conditions for changing the values of `i`, `ul`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` are only met if they are not already set (as per the initial postcondition), the `break` statement does not alter these values. Therefore, the values of `i` and `ul` remain as specified in the precondition, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains 0. We also note that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
