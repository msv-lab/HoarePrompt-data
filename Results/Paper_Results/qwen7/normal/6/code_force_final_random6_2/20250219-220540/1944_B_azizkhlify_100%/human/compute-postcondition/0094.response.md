Based on the initial state provided, `i` is the next element in `res`, and `res` must contain at least one element. Since `i` is the next element in `res`, it means `i` is the first element of `res`.

Given this, the print statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the first element of `res`.

Output: **the first element of res**
