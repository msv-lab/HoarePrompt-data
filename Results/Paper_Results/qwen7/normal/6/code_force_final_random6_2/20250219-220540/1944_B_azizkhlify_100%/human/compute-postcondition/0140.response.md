Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Since `i` is 0 initially, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Therefore, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
