Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `l[a[4] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4.

5. **Consider the effect of the loop body**:
   - The loop body increments `l[a[4] - 1]` by 1. This means that before the next iteration, `l[a[4] - 1]` will have been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state:

- `i` will be incremented to 5.
- `n` must still be greater than 4.
- The value of `l[a[4] - 1]` will have been incremented by 1 from its previous value, but since we don't know the exact initial value, we only need to note that it has been incremented.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, `l[a[4] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
