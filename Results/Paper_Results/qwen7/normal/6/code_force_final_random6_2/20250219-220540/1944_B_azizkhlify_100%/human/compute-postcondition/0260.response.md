Output State: **`res` list remains empty, `ul` is incremented by 6, `ur` is incremented by 6, `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The values of `res`, `ul`, `ur`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `res` list remains empty, `ul` is incremented by 6, `ur` is incremented by 6, `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.
