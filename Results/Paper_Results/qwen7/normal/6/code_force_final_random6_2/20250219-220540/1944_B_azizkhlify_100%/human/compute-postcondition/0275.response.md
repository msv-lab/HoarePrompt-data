Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be greater than 0 (since the loop starts at `i = n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`).
   - Given that after the loop completes, `i` should be equal to `2 * n`, we need to ensure that `n` is sufficiently large such that the loop can run for at least one iteration.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 6, we need to ensure this condition is met.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to `n` to match the starting point of the loop.

4. **Consider the Final Condition**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `2 * n`.
   - This means that `n` must be at least 7 (since if `n` were 6, `i` would only reach `12`, but the loop would stop at `11`).

5. **List the Adjusted States**:
   - `i` must be set to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 6.
   - No other states need adjustment as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 6**.
