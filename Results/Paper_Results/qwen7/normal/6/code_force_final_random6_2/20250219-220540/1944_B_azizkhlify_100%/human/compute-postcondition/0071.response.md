Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `re` is `re_prev + 1`, `res` is a list with the element `a[i_prev + 1]` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `res`. Given that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, the new value of `i` remains `i_prev + 1`. Similarly, `re` remains `re_prev + 1`. The initial conditions for `n` remain unchanged. The list `res` now contains one additional element, which is `a[i_prev + 1]`.
