Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a non-empty list, meaning it contains at least one element.
- `i` is the next element in `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the next element in the list `res`. Since `res` is non-empty, `i` must be one of the elements in `res`.

Output: **the next element in the list res**
