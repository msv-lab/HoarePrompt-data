Output State: **Postcondition: `res` contains all the elements of the list `a`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of `res`, `ul`, `n`, or `i`. The only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block we were inside.
