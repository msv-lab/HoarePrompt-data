Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations, but since the loop body is omitted, we focus on the variables that change within the loop.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `res` list remains empty
   - `ul` is incremented by 6 (so `ul = ul + 6`)
   - `ur` is incremented by 6 (so `ur = ur + 6`)
   - `i` is 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues to execute as long as `ul` does not equal `ur`. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop will break.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is used as an index in the loop, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `ul` and `ur` are both incremented by 6 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `ul` does not equal `ur`.

Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. `ul` and `ur` will both be incremented by 6, so if they were `x` and `y` respectively at the end of the previous iteration, they will become `x+6` and `y+6` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the exact values of `ul` and `ur` are not provided, we can denote them as `ul_new` and `ur_new` where `ul_new = ul + 6` and `ur_new = ur + 6`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `res` list remains empty
- `ul` is incremented by 6, so `ul` becomes `ul + 6`
- `ur` is incremented by 6, so `ur` becomes `ur + 6`
- `i` is 4

State: **`res` list remains empty, `ul` is incremented by 6, `ur` is incremented by 6, `i` is 4**
