Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `2 * n`, where `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

Given these details, let's determine what will be printed:

- Since `i` is `2 * n` and `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be a positive even number.
- `a` is a list of integers, but the specific values in the list are not provided.
- The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, which means that the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is set to 1.

However, the value of `a[i]` itself is not directly given. We need to find out what `a[i]` is. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, it implies that `a[i] - 1` is the index in list `l` that holds the value 1. But this does not give us the exact value of `a[i]`.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact integer value that will be printed. However, we know that `a[i]` is an integer from the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value at index `i` in the list `a`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **[integer value from a at index i]**
