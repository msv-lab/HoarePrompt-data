Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `x + 1`
- `n` is defined as `y`
- `ul` is defined as `z`

However, there is no mention of the variable `a` in the initial state. Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its contents. Therefore, the output will depend on the values of `a[i]`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since we do not have the explicit value of `a[i]`, we can only describe it in terms of the index `i` and the list `a`.

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where [a[i]] is the value of the element at index i in the list a)**
