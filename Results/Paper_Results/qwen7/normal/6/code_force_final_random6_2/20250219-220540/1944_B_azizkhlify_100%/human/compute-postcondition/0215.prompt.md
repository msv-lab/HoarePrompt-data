Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `i` will be `2 * n`, `ul` will be `2 * k`, and the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` will be 0 for each iteration where the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was met. The if condition evaluates to true since `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or has not been checked, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 and the condition `(re == k)` is true. If `(re == k)` is true, `res` contains the element `a[i]`. If `(re == k)` is false, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 1 or has not been checked, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 and the condition `(re == k)` is true, `re` is increased by 1, and `res` now includes `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1, and if `re == k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is either `1` or has not been checked, `res` is a list containing the element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to `1` and the condition `(re == k)` is true, `re` is incremented by `1`, and if `re == k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
