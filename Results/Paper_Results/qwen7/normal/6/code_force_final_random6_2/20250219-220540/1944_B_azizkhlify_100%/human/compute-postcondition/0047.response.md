Output State: **`i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `ul` is `z + 4`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Given that `ul` was initially `k * 2` if `z + 2 == k * 2`, otherwise `ul` was `z + 2`, the new value of `ul` becomes `z + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
