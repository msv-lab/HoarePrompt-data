Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `ul` is incremented by 2, `ur` is `ur + 4`, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is directly associated with, the variables `res`, `ul`, `ur`, and `i` retain their previous values. The `break` statement does not modify these variables but indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional block if present.
