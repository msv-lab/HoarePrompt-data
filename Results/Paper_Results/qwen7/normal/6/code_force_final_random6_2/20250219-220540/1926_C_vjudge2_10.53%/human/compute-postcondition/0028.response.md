Output State: `i` is 9; `values` is a list with elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; `total` is 45; `sum_values` is a list with elements [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45].

Explanation: The loop runs 10 times (from `i=0` to `i=9`). Each iteration sets `values[i]` to `i`, increments `total` by `i`, and updates `sum_values[i]` to be the current value of `total`. After all iterations, `i` will be 9, `values` will contain the integers from 0 to 9, `total` will be the sum of the first 10 non-negative integers (which is 45), and `sum_values` will contain the cumulative sums up to each index, resulting in the sequence of partial sums of the first 10 non-negative integers.
