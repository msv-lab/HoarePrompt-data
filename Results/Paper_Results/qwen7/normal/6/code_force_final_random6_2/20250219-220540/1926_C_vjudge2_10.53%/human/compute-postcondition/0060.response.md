Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. The function processes these test cases and returns different outputs based on the values of t and n.**

Given the constraints and the lack of direct parameter acceptance in the function signature, it's clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers (t and n), and perform some operation or validation based on these values.
