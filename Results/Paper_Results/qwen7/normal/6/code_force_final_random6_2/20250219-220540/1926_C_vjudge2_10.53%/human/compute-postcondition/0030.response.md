Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(10, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The state before the loop starts mentions that `i` is 9.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 10 to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 9, the loop will not execute because 9 is not within the range 10 to `n + 1` (assuming `n` is some value greater than or equal to 10).

4. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**: To make the loop execute, `i` must be at least 10. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to 10 or more, and `n` must be at least 10.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`values`, `total`, and `sum_values`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain in their current states.

Based on this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should be 10 or more, and `n` must be at least 10.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 10, `n` must be at least 10**
