Output State: **`i` is 12; `word` is '12'; `last` is 2; `remainder` is 1; `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`. Given the initial values, `values[last]` is `values[2]` and `values[remainder]` is `values[1]`. However, since the actual values of `values[2]` and `values[1]` are not provided, the updated value of `values[i]` is expressed as `values[2] + values[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
