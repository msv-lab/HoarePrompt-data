Output State: **`i` is 10; `word` is '10'; `remainder` is 1; `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`; `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`; `sum_values[i]` is `sum_total`**

Explanation: The code updates `sum_values[i]` to be equal to `sum_total`. Since `sum_total` is defined as `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, and `values[i]` is defined as `values[last] + values[remainder]`, these relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `sum_values[i]` is now directly set to `sum_total`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
