### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program is incorrect due to the way it handles multi-digit numbers. Specifically, the program incorrectly sums the values of the last digit and the remaining part of the number, rather than summing the digits themselves.

Let's break down the issues and provide a correct solution:

1. **Handling Multi-Digit Numbers:**
   - The original program attempts to handle multi-digit numbers by splitting the number into its last digit and the remaining part. However, it incorrectly sums these parts instead of summing the individual digits.
   - For example, for the number 19, the program would incorrectly compute `values[19] = values[9] + values[1]`, which is not the correct approach.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` and then sum these results.
   - We can achieve this by iterating through each number and summing its digits directly.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n`.

2. **Summing Digits:**
   - For each number from 1 to `n`, the program converts the number to a string and then iterates over each character (digit) in the string.
   - It converts each character back to an integer and sums these integers.

3. **Outputting Results:**
   - The program prints the total sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n`.

This approach ensures that the sum of the digits is correctly calculated for each number, and the overall sum is computed accurately.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrected approach, the original program is indeed incorrect. The corrected program provided above will produce the correct results.

Final: **False**
