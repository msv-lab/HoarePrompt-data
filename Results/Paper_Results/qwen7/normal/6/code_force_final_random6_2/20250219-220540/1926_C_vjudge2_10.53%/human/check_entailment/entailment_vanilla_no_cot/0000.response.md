Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed and does not accurately compute the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits.

Here's why it's incorrect:
1. **Initialization and Calculation**: The program initializes `values` and `sum_values` arrays up to `max(numbers)`, but it does not handle numbers larger than 9 properly.
2. **Recursive Sum Calculation**: The logic to calculate the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9 is incorrect. It splits the number into its last digit and the remaining part, but it incorrectly uses previously computed sums without properly accumulating them.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The final sum calculation for each test case is also incorrect because it does not correctly accumulate the sums for all numbers up to `n`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
1. Read the input for the number of test cases and each `n`.
2. For each `n`, compute the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` and keep a running total.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            num_str = str(i)
            digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in num_str)
            total_sum += digit_sum
        results.append(total_sum)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

This version correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` and accumulates the total sum for each test case.
