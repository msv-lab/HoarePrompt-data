Output State: **`i` is 10; `word` is '10'; `remainder` is 1; `values[i]` is `values[last] + values[remainder]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`. However, since the initial values of `last` and `values` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `values[i]`. Therefore, we express it as `values[i]` being equal to `values[last] + values[remainder]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
