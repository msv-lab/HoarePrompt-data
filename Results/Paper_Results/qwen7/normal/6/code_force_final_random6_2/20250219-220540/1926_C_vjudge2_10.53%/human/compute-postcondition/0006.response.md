Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list containing the element `input()`**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4 - 1\). The list `numbers` is updated to contain the new value of `n`.
