Output State: **`i` is 11; `word` is '11', `n` must be greater than or equal to 11**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 11. The code converts `i` to a string and assigns it to `word`. Therefore, `word` becomes '11'. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 11 remains unchanged.
