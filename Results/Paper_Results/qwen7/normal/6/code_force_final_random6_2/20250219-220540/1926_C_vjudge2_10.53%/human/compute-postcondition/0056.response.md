Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `numbers` must be a non-empty list, and `n` is the second element of `numbers`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for n in numbers:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

   - The variable `n` is being assigned the value from the `numbers` list during each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `numbers` list.

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must still contain at least one element. Since `n` is set to the second element of `numbers` in the current iteration, `numbers` must have at least two elements for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

4. **New State**: After the current iteration, `n` will be set to the third element of `numbers` if it exists. Therefore, `numbers` must have at least three elements for the loop to execute one more time.

Given this analysis, the new state should reflect that `numbers` must have at least three elements, and `n` will be set to the third element of `numbers`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numbers` must be a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element of `numbers`**
