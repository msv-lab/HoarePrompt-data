Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 9999, `n` is the integer value of the last input, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of an input during the loop iterations, `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    values[i] = i
    total += i
    sum_values[i] = total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0; `values` is a list with elements [0, 0]; `total` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1; `values` is a list with elements [0, 1, 1]; `total` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `values[i]` is equal to `i`, `total` is increased by `i`, `sum_values[i]` is equal to `total`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
