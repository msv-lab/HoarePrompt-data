You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000 - 2, `n` is the integer value of the last input, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of an input during the loop iterations.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be one less than the maximum possible value (10000), indicating the number of times the loop ran. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input received. The list `numbers` will contain exactly `t` elements, each being an integer input provided during the loop's execution.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: i is 9; values is a list with elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; total is 45; sum_values is a list with elements [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45].
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: i is 19; word is '19'; last is 9; remainder is 1; values[19] is values[9] + values[1]; sum_total is values[19] + sum_values[18]; sum_values[19] is sum_total.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as the `numbers` list has more elements. After all iterations, `n` will be the last element of the `numbers` list, and the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `i` will be the last index of the `numbers` list.
    #- `word` will be the string representation of `i`.
    #- `last` will be the last digit of `i`.
    #- `remainder` will be the result of `i % 10`.
    #- `values[i]` will be the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`.
    #- `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`.
    #- `sum_values[i]` will be equal to `sum_total`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reflect the final index processed from the `numbers` list, and all other variables will be updated according to their respective calculations based on the final value of `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. The function processes these test cases and returns different outputs based on the values of t and n.
