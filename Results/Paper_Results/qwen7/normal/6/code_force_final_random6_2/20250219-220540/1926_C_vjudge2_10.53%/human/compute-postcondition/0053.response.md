Based on the initial state provided:

- `numbers` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is the first element of `numbers`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(sum_values[n])
```

Here, `sum_values` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since it is not defined, we cannot determine its contents or the value of `sum_values[n]`. Therefore, we can only describe the situation in terms of the given information.

Output: **sum_values[n] (where n is the first element of the non-empty list numbers and sum_values is an undefined list)**
