Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000 - 2, `n` is the integer value of the last input, `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the integer value of an input during the loop iterations.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be one less than the maximum possible value (10000), indicating the number of times the loop ran. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input received. The list `numbers` will contain exactly `t` elements, each being an integer input provided during the loop's execution.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i

        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: i is 9; values is a list with elements [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; total is 45; sum_values is a list with elements [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45].
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: i is 19; word is '19'; last is 9; remainder is 1; values[19] is values[9] + values[1]; sum_total is values[19] + sum_values[18]; sum_values[19] is sum_total.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as the `numbers` list has more elements. After all iterations, `n` will be the last element of the `numbers` list, and the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `i` will be the last index of the `numbers` list.
    #- `word` will be the string representation of `i`.
    #- `last` will be the last digit of `i`.
    #- `remainder` will be the result of `i % 10`.
    #- `values[i]` will be the sum of `values[last]` and `values[remainder]`.
    #- `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`.
    #- `sum_values[i]` will be equal to `sum_total`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reflect the final index processed from the `numbers` list, and all other variables will be updated according to their respective calculations based on the final value of `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). It initializes a list `numbers` to store \( t \) values, then constructs two lists `values` and `sum_values` based on the maximum value in `numbers`. It updates these lists through nested loops, finally printing the values from `sum_values` corresponding to each element in `numbers`.
