Output State: **`i` is 11; `word` is '11'; `remainder` is 1**

Explanation: The code `remainder = int(word[:-1])` takes the string `word` which is '11', removes the last character (which is '1'), and converts the remaining substring '1' into an integer, resulting in `remainder` being 1. The values of `i` and `word` remain unchanged.
