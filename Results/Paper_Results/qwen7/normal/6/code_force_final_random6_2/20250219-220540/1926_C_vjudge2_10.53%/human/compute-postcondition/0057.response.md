Given the initial state where `numbers` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements and `n` is the third element of `numbers`, let's break down the problem:

1. `numbers` is a list with at least 3 elements. Let's denote the elements of the list as `numbers[0]`, `numbers[1]`, `numbers[2]`, and so on.
2. `n` is specifically defined as the third element of the list `numbers`, which means `n = numbers[2]`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(sum_values[n])
```

Here, `sum_values` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `n` is used as an index into `sum_values`, we need to assume that `sum_values` is a list or a collection that has at least one element at the index `n` (which is `numbers[2]`).

Since the exact contents of `sum_values` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **sum_values[numbers[2]] (where numbers[2] is the third element of the list numbers)**
