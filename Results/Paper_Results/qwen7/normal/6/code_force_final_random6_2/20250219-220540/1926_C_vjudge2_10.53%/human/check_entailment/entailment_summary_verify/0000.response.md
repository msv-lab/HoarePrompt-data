### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Vladislav writes integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board.
- Each integer is replaced with the sum of its digits.
- We need to find the sum of these new numbers.

#### Given Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It initializes `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values` based on the maximum value in `numbers`.
- It updates these lists through nested loops.
- Finally, it prints the values from `sum_values` corresponding to each element in `numbers`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Sum Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to break down each number into its last digit and the remaining part but incorrectly updates the `values` array.
   - For instance, for a number like 123, it should sum the digits 1, 2, and 3, but the current logic does not correctly handle this.

2. **Precomputation Limitation**:
   - The precomputation step only works for numbers up to the maximum value in the input, which is not efficient and does not cover all possible test cases, especially for large values of \( n \).

3. **Incorrect Update Mechanism**:
   - The update mechanism for `values[i]` and `sum_values[i]` is flawed. It does not correctly compute the sum of digits for each number.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The program initializes `values` and `sum_values` for numbers from 0 to 9, which is correct.
- For numbers from 10 to \( n \), it attempts to break down the number into its last digit and the remaining part. However, the logic to update `values[i]` is incorrect because it assumes the sum of digits can be computed by summing the values of the last digit and the remaining part, which is not always true.

For example, for \( n = 12 \):
- Correct sum: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 51 \).
- The program's logic fails to correctly compute this sum due to the flawed approach described above.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
