The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). It initializes a list `numbers` to store \( t \) values, then constructs two lists `values` and `sum_values` based on the maximum value in `numbers`. It updates these lists through nested loops, finally printing the values from `sum_values` corresponding to each element in `numbers`.
