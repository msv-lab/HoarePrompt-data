Output State: **`i` is 1; `values` is a list with elements [0, 1]; `total` is 0**

Explanation: The code `values[i] = i` updates the list `values` at index `i` with the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `values[1]` is set to 1, making the list `values` now `[0, 1]`. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged.
