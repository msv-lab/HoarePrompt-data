Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `count_1 = s.count('1')` calculates the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `count_1`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The postcondition remains the same as the precondition regarding the conditions involving `count_1` and its relationship with the string `s`.
