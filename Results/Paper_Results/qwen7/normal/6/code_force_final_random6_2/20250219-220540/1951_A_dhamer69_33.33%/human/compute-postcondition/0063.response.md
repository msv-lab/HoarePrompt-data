Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if the string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. In all other cases, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
