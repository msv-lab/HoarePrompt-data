Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func` does not match the problem description given in the comment above it. The comment suggests that the function should be generating files for HTML files within a specified range in subfolders, but the actual function `func` is solving a different problem related to checking strings and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
