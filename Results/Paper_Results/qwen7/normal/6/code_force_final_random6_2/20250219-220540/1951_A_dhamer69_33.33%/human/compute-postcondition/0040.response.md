Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user. Since the if condition checks if `s == '00'` and there is no action specified within the if or else blocks, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
