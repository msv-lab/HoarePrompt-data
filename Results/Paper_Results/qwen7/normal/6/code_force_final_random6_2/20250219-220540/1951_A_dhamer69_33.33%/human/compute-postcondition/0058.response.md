Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values; it directly prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
