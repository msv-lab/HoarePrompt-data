Functionality: **The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges `k` to be removed such that 1 â‰¤ k < n. It performs a binary search to find a point `beg` (or `end`) where the condition converges, meaning `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates, and returns this value.**
