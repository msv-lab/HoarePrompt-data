Output State: The final values of `beg`, `end`, and `mid` will be such that `beg` is equal to `end`.

Explanation: The loop continues to narrow down the range between `beg` and `end` until they converge. After each iteration, `mid` is recalculated as the midpoint of the current range. Depending on the outcome of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, either `beg` or `end` is updated. Eventually, when `beg` equals `end`, the condition `beg < end` fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, both `beg` and `end` will hold the same value, which is the result of the binary search performed by the loop.
