Functionality: **The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree class), a root vertex `v`, and a minimum size `x`. It returns two values: the first is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and the second is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values.**
