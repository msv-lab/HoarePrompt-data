You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `tree` is an instance of a tree class representing a tree structure where each vertex has a `children` attribute containing its child vertices; `v` is an integer representing the root vertex of the current subtree being processed; `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing exactly `k` edges.
def func_2(tree, v, x):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: good_components is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`; `remaining_size` is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values.
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns good_components which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and remaining_size which is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree class), a root vertex `v`, and a minimum size `x`. It returns two values: the first is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and the second is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns good_components which is the sum of all `good_components_subtree` values plus the number of times `remaining_size_subtree` was greater than or equal to `x`, and remaining_size which is the sum of all `remaining_size_subtree` values.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
