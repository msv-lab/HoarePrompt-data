Postcondition: **All children of vertex `v` have been processed. If any child's `remaining_size` was less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all such children. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` whose `remaining_size` was greater than or equal to `x`, plus the number of such children. Furthermore, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`.**
