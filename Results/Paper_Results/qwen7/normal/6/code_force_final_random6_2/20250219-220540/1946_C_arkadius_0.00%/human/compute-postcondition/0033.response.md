Output State: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`, plus the number of such children. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all children `u` of `v`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will contain the count of good components among all children of vertex `v` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will hold the total `remaining_size` of all children of `v`.
