Functionality: **The function accepts a tree (an instance of a class with attributes `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`), a starting vertex `s`, and a minimum size `x`. It returns a tuple containing the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the vertex with the identifier `s`. The `good_components` is calculated as the sum of `good_components` from all its children plus the count of children whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` is the total `remaining_size` of all its children.**
