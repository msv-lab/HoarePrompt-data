Output State: **`stack` contains the remaining elements after popping, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, and `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`.**

Explanation: The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops an element from the `stack` and assigns it to a tuple `(v, postorder)`. Since the `stack` initially contains at least one element, after popping, `stack` will contain the remaining elements (if any). The values of `v` and `postorder` are the elements that were popped from the `stack`.
