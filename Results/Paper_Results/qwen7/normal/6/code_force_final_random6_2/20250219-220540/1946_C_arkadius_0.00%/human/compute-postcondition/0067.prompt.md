Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack contains tuples for each child of vertex v. Each tuple is of the form (u, False), indicating that none of the children have been fully processed or marked as special (i.e., their remaining_size did not meet the condition >= x to be marked as (u, True)). If any child's remaining_size met the condition during the loop, there might be one tuple of the form (u, True) in the stack, but this is not guaranteed for every child. Additionally, the postorder traversal has been initiated.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by either 1 (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`) or by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` (if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`). The stack must still contain at least one tuple (u, False).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by either 2 or by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`. `u` is the next child of `tree.vertices[v]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
