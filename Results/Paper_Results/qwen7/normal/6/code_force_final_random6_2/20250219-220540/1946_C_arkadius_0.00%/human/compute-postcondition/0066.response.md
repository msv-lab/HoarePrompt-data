Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` plus 1. `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`. `u` is the next child of `tree.vertices[v]`.**
