The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), the number of vertices `n`, and the number of edges `k` to be removed such that 1 â‰¤ k < n. It performs a binary search to find a point where the condition converges, meaning the values of `beg` and `end` are equal after the loop terminates, and returns this converged value.
