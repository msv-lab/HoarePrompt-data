Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree
   - `[u, v]` is a list of two integers obtained from input, and the edge (u-1, v-1) has been added to the tree.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - The state of `[u, v]` and the tree edge addition does not change within the loop head, so these remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `[u, v]` is a list of two integers obtained from input, and the edge (u-1, v-1) has been added to the tree**.
