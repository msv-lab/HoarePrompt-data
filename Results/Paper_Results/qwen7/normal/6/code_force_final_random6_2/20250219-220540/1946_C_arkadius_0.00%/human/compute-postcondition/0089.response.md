Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
