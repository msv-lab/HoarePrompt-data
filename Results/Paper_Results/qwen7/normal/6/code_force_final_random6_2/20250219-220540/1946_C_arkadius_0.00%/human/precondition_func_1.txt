`tree` is an instance of a tree class representing a tree structure where each vertex has a `children` attribute containing its child vertices; `v` is an integer representing the root vertex of the current subtree being processed; `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing exactly `k` edges.
