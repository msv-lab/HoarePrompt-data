Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to be `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1` increases the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` by 1. The values of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to be its original value plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
