Postcondition: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is updated to either `tree.vertices[v].good_components' + 1` or `tree.vertices[v].good_components' + tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, depending on whether `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is updated to include the remaining size of `u`, and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is used in the condition to update `tree.vertices[v].good_components'`.**
