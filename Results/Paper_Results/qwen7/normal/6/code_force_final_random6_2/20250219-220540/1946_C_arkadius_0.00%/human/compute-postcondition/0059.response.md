Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`; `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`; `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` to it. The value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has already been increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` before this line of code was executed, and `tree.vertices[u].good_components` remains unchanged.
