Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and the `tree` object contains `n-1 + k` edges after the root tree has been processed non-recursively starting from vertex 0.**

The method `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` processes the tree starting from vertex 0 in a non-recursive manner. This method does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or `k`. It also does not modify the number of edges in the `tree` object, which remains `n-1 + k`. The output state retains the initial conditions with the additional information that the root tree has been processed.
