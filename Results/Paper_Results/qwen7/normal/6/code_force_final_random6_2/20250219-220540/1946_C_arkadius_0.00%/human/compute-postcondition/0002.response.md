Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.
4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 1 and that `i` remains less than `n` throughout the loop iterations.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be set to 1 initially.
- `i` must remain less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `i` must be less than `n`**
