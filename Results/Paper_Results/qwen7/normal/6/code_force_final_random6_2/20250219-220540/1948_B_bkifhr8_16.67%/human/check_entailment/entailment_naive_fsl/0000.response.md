Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the described operation. Specifically, the program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list, but it does so in a way that does not guarantee the array will become sorted. The program also does not handle the logic for sorting after performing the operation, which is necessary to ensure the array is sorted.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will split `45` and `67` into `[4, 5]` and `[6, 7]`, respectively, resulting in the array `[12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. However, it does not check if the array is now sorted or if further operations are needed. Instead, it calls `func_1`, which simply checks if the array is sorted without performing any operations to make it sorted if it isn't.

This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the array will be sorted after performing the operations. A correct solution would need to include a mechanism to sort the array after each operation or ensure that the operations performed do not disrupt the sorted order.
