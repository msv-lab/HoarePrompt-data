Output State: **The program returns True if the list 'lst' is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False.**

This means that the program checks if the list `lst` is sorted in the same order as `sorted_lst`. If `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, the program returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
