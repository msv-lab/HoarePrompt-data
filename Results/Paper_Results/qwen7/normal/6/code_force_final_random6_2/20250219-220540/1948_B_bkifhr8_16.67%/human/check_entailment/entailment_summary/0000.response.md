Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issue lies in the way the operations are applied to the array. Specifically, the program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and reinsert them, but it does not properly handle the transformation process to ensure the array can be sorted. Additionally, the program does not actually perform the splitting and reinsertion of digits as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply checks if the array is sorted after a single pass through the array, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The program does not correctly split and reinsert the digits of elements greater than 10. It only checks if the array is sorted after one pass, which is not sufficient.
2. **Lack of Iterative Splitting**: The program should repeatedly check and possibly split elements until no further splits are needed or the array is sorted.
3. **Insufficient Logic**: The `func_1` function only checks if the array is sorted, which is not enough to determine if the array can be transformed into a sorted array using the allowed operations.

Given these issues, the program cannot correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
