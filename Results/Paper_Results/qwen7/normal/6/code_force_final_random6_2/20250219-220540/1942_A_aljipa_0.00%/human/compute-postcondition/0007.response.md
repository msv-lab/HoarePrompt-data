Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, otherwise `res` is `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 1, `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` based on the conditions involving `k`. If `k == n`, `res` is set to `[1] * n`. If `k == 1`, `res` is set to `range(n)`. Otherwise, `res` is set to `[-1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
