To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the `print(*res)` statement step by step.

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `res` is defined based on the values of `k` and `n`:
     - If `k == n`, then `res = [1] * n`.
     - If `k == 1`, then `res = range(n)`.
     - Otherwise, `res = [-1]`.

2. **Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Possible Values for `res`:**
   - If `k == n`, `res` will be a list containing `n` ones.
   - If `k == 1`, `res` will be a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `res` will be a list containing `-1`.

4. **Printing `res`:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of `res` separated by spaces.
   - If `res` is a list of ones, it will print `1` repeated `n` times.
   - If `res` is a range object, it will print the numbers from `0` to `n-1` separated by spaces.
   - If `res` is a list of `-1`, it will print `-1` repeated `n` times.

Given the above, the output will depend on the values of `k` and `n`. Since the exact values of `k` and `n` are not specified, we need to consider the three possible cases:

- If `k == n`, the output will be: **1 1 1 ... 1** (with `n` ones).
- If `k == 1`, the output will be: **0 1 2 ... n-1** (the numbers from `0` to `n-1`).
- Otherwise, the output will be: **-1 -1 -1 ... -1** (with `n` negative ones).

Since the exact values of `k` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the conditions given.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1** or **0 1 2 ... n-1** or **-1 -1 -1 ... -1** (depending on the values of `k` and `n`).
