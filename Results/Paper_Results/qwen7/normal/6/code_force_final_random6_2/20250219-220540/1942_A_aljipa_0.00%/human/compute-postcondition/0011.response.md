Output State: **`res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n` else `range(n)` if `k == 1` else `[-1]`, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^3\) (inclusive) minus 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` based on the conditions involving `k` and `n`. If `k == n`, `res` is set to `[1] * n`, which means a list of `n` ones. If `k == 1`, `res` is set to `range(n)`, which is a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `res` remains `[-1]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
