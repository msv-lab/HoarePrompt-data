Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates through each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.
3. The logic for determining the result (`res`) based on the values of `n` and `k` is as follows:
   - If `k == n`, the result is a list of `n` ones (`[1] * n`).
   - If `k == 1`, the result is a range of integers from `0` to `n-1` (`range(n)`).
   - Otherwise, the result is `[-1]`.
4. The program prints the result for each test case and sets `t` to `0` at the end, which is unnecessary since `t` is not used after the loop.

However, the logic for generating the result is incomplete. Specifically:
- When `k == n`, the requirement is that all cyclic shifts must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same, which is correctly handled by `[1] * n`.
- When `k == 1`, the requirement is that exactly one cyclic shift must be sorted. This can be achieved by ensuring that the smallest element is at the beginning of the array, and the rest are in increasing order except for the last element, which is greater than the first. The provided solution using `range(n)` does not guarantee that exactly one cyclic shift will be sorted.
- When `k > 1` and `k < n`, the requirement is that exactly `k` cyclic shifts must be sorted. The current implementation using `[-1]` does not meet this requirement.

Given these points, the program does not correctly generate the required arrays for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
