Reasoning:
- The program is designed to solve the problem by reading multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and their best friends' indices stored in the list `p`.
- It constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` corresponds to the best friend of the `i-th` friend.
- The program then checks if there exists any pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it means that sending invitations to these two friends will ensure both come to the party, requiring only 2 invitations.
- If no such pair exists, the program prints `3`, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
- The program correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations required based on the conditions given in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
