The function reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n`. It then constructs a new list `v` of length `n+1` initialized to zero. The function checks if there exists an index `i` from 1 to `n` such that `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and returns immediately. If no such index exists after checking all elements, the function prints `3` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and returns either `3` or `None` depending on whether a return statement is encountered.
