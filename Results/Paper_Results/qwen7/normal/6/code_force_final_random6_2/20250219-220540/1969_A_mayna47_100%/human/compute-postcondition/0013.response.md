Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be incremented to 3.
- `n` remains the same since it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`. This statement will directly print the integer 2 without any dependency on the values of `i` or `n`.

Output: **2**
