Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `p`, while adding the new list `v` with its specific initialization.
