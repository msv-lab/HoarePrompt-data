### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes a list `v` with zeros, and then updates this list with the input values.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[i])` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because sending invitations to both `i` and `v[i]` will ensure that at least two friends come to the party.
4. **Fallback Case**: If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`, which means sending invitations to three friends is necessary to ensure at least two friends come to the party.

However, there is a subtle issue in the code:
- The list `v` is initialized with `n+1` elements, but only the first `n` elements are relevant (from index 1 to n).
- The line `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` should be `v = list(map(int, input().split()))` to avoid unnecessary extra element at index 0.

Despite this minor issue, the logic of the program is sound and will correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is logically correct and will produce the right output for the given problem statement. The minor initialization issue does not affect the correctness of the solution.
