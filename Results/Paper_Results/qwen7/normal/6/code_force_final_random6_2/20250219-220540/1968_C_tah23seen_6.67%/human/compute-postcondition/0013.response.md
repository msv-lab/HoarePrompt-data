Output State: `arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is \( n-1 \), `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]`, ..., `ans[n-1]` is the sum of all previous `ans` values from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `ans` will contain `n` elements, with `ans[0]` being `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for \( 1 \leq i < n \)) will be the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`. The loop continues until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which, given the conditions provided, will happen after processing all elements in `arr`.
