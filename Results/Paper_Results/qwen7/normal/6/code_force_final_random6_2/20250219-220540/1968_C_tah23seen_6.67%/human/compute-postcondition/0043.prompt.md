You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `ans` will be a list of \( n \) elements where each element is calculated as follows:
    #
    #- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
    #- For \( 1 \leq i < n \), `ans[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`, adjusted such that `ans[i]` continues to double until it either exceeds `arr[i]` or the loop terminates. Specifically, `ans[i]` will be the result of the largest geometric progression starting from `ans[0]` (which is `arr[0] + 1`) and doubling each step, until the next term would exceed `arr[i]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans[i]` for each \( i \) is the sum of a sequence starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed `arr[i]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' where ans[0] is arr[0] + 1, and for each 1 ≤ i < n, ans[i] is the sum of a sequence starting from arr[0] + 1 and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed arr[i]. The last element ans[-1] is the sum of all previous elements in ans up to ans[-2] plus arr[-1]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is an integer indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `1 ≤ i < n`, `ans[i]` is the sum of a sequence starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step until the next term would exceed `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[-2]` plus `arr[-1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'ans' where ans[0] is arr[0] + 1, and for each 1 ≤ i < n, ans[i] is the sum of a sequence starting from arr[0] + 1 and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed arr[i]. The last element ans[-1] is the sum of all previous elements in ans up to ans[-2] plus arr[-1]


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
