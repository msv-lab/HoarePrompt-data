#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `ans` will be a list of \( n \) elements where each element is calculated as follows:
    #
    #- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
    #- For \( 1 \leq i < n \), `ans[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`, adjusted such that `ans[i]` continues to double until it either exceeds `arr[i]` or the loop terminates. Specifically, `ans[i]` will be the result of the largest geometric progression starting from `ans[0]` (which is `arr[0] + 1`) and doubling each step, until the next term would exceed `arr[i]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans[i]` for each \( i \) is the sum of a sequence starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed `arr[i]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' where ans[0] is arr[0] + 1, and for each 1 ≤ i < n, ans[i] is the sum of a sequence starting from arr[0] + 1 and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed arr[i]. The last element ans[-1] is the sum of all previous elements in ans up to ans[-2] plus arr[-1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of `n-1` integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `1 ≤ i < n`, `ans[i]` is the sum of a sequence starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step until the next term would exceed `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[-2]` plus `arr[-1]`.
