Output State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i]' plus `ans[i]' and must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]'**.

This means that the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to be the sum of `ans[i]` and `ans[i]`, which is effectively doubling the value of `ans[i]`. The condition that `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
