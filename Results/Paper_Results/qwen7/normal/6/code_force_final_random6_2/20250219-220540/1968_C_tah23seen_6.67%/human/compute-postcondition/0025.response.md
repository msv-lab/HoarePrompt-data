Postcondition: **`ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` values up to `ans[i]`.**

This means that after the if statement executes, the list `ans` will have been updated so that each element `ans[i + 1]` (for \( 1 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i]`. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it will be updated accordingly. This process ensures that `ans[i + 1]` reflects the cumulative sum as described.
