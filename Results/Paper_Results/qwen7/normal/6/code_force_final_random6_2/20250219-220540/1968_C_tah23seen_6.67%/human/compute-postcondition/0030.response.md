The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still hold true at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `ans[i + 1]` is now equal to `ans[i + 1]` plus `ans[i]`, and the condition that `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` still holds.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. Since the loop body has already updated `ans[i + 1]` to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, the new value of `ans[i + 1]` should still satisfy the condition.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the states since the condition is already satisfied based on the given information.

State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i + 1]' plus `ans[i]' and the condition that `ans[i + 1]' must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]' still holds**.
