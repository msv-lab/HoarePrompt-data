Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans[i + 1]` will be equal to the sum of all previous `ans[i]` values up to the last iteration where the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` was still satisfied.

This means that `ans[i + 1]` will accumulate the sum of all preceding `ans[i]` values until it either exceeds `arr[i + 1]` or the loop terminates. The final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be the sum of a geometric progression starting from `ans[0]` (assuming `ans[0]` is the initial value before the loop starts) and each subsequent term being double the previous one, as long as it does not exceed `arr[i + 1]`.
