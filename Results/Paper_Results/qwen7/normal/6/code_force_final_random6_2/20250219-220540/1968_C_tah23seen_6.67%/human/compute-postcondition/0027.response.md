Output State: **`ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. Since `i` must be less than `n - 2`, the other elements of the list `ans` remain unchanged. The updated value of `ans[i + 1]` reflects the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i]`.
