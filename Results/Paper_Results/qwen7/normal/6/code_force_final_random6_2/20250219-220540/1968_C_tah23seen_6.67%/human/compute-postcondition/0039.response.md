Output State: The final state of `ans` will be a list of \( n \) elements where each element is calculated as follows:

- `ans[0]` remains `arr[0] + 1`.
- For \( 1 \leq i < n \), `ans[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`, adjusted such that `ans[i]` continues to double until it either exceeds `arr[i]` or the loop terminates. Specifically, `ans[i]` will be the result of the largest geometric progression starting from `ans[0]` (which is `arr[0] + 1`) and doubling each step, until the next term would exceed `arr[i]`.

In simpler terms, `ans[i]` for each \( i \) is the sum of a sequence starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed `arr[i]`.
