Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by selecting different segments of the array. Instead, it checks if the first and last elements are the same and then tries to find the longest segment of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element. This approach does not guarantee the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output should be 4, as we can change the entire array to either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5, resulting in a cost of 4. However, the provided function will not handle this case correctly and will likely return an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible segments and calculate the cost for each segment, then choose the minimum cost among them.
