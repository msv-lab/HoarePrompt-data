Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and the length of `arr` must be at least 2. If `arr[i]` equals `arr[j]`, then `i` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is either the length of `arr` - 2 or the length of `arr` - 3. Otherwise, `i` remains either 0 or 1, `j` remains either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
