Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and the value of `arr[i]` is equal to the value of `arr[j]`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The value of `j` and the relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` remain unchanged.
