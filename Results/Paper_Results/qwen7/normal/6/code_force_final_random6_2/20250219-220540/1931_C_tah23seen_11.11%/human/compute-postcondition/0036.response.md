Output State: **The program returns -1**

Explanation: Given the initial state, we know that `i = j + 4` and `arr[i - 1] == arr[i]`. Also, `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. 

Since `i = j + 4`, if `j` is `len(arr) - 1`, then `i` would be `len(arr)` which is out of bounds for the array `arr`. However, because `arr[i - 1] == arr[i]` must hold true, `i - 1` should also be within the bounds of the array and equal to `i`. This implies that `i - 1` and `i` point to the same element in the array, but since `i` is one index beyond the last valid index of the array (`len(arr)`), there cannot be such a pair in the array that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

Therefore, the subtraction `j - i` results in `-1`.
