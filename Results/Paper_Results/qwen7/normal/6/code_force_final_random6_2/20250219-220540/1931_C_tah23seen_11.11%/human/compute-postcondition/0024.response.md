Output State: **The program returns 0**

The code simply returns the integer 0 without affecting any other variables. Given the initial state where `i` is greater than `j`, and `i` was initially greater than or equal to `j`, the return statement does not change these conditions or any other variables. Therefore, the program returns 0.
