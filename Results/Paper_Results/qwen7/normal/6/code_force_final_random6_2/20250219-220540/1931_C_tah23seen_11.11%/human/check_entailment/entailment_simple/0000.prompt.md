Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is greater than or equal to `j`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be greater than or equal to the variable `j`. This is because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. Once `i` becomes greater than `j`, the condition `i <= j` in the while loop head fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, the array has been checked for matching elements from both ends towards the center, and the loop naturally stops when there are no more pairs to compare or when a mismatch is found.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `i` is greater than or equal to `j`, and `i` is not greater than `j`
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: The value of `i` is equal to `j` + 4, and the condition `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` holds true.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns a value that is j - i + 1, where i is equal to j + 4 and the condition arr[i - 1] equals arr[i] holds true.
    #State: The value of `i` is equal to `j` + 4, and the condition `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `arr[i]` holds true, and `j` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`
    return j - i
    #The program returns -1
