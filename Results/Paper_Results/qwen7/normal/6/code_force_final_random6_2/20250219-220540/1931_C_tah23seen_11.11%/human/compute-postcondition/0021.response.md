Output State: `i` is greater than or equal to `j`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be greater than or equal to the variable `j`. This is because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. Once `i` becomes greater than `j`, the condition `i <= j` in the while loop header fails, and the loop terminates. At this point, the loop has processed all possible pairs of elements from the start and end of the array, ensuring that either they match (and both indices move towards the center) or a mismatch is found (causing the loop to exit).
