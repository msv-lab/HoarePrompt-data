Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The logic in the function is flawed:
     - The initial while loop checks if the elements from both ends are equal. If they are, it moves inward. However, this does not necessarily lead to finding the optimal solution.
     - The subsequent while loop checks for consecutive equal elements starting from `i`. This is also not the correct approach.
     - The final return statements do not cover all possible scenarios for making all elements equal. The logic is incomplete and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal using at most one operation.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - To solve this problem optimally, we should consider the minimum cost to make all elements equal. The optimal strategy involves identifying the longest segment where all elements are the same or can be made the same with minimal cost.
   - We need to iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum length of segments where elements are the same or can be made the same with minimal cost.

Given the above analysis, the provided function does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
