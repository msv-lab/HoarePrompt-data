Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `i` will be either 1 or 2. The value of `j` remains unchanged because the code only affects `i`. Therefore, `j` is still either the length of `arr` - 1 or the length of `arr` - 2. The length of `arr` being at least 2 is also preserved.
