Postcondition: `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is less than or equal to \(2 * x\), `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, where `x` is either `a - x` or `b - x` depending on the condition, and `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`.
