Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic for handling the remaining attacks when there is one ship left is incorrect. The current implementation checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `nums[0]` but does not properly account for the remaining attacks on the last ship.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a = nums.popleft()
        b = nums.pop()
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    # Handle the case where there is one ship left
    if k > 0 and len(nums) == 1:
        remaining_attacks = min(k, nums[0])
        ans += remaining_attacks
        k -= remaining_attacks
    return ans

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)
```

In this corrected version, the function properly handles the scenario where there is one ship left and ensures that the remaining attacks are correctly applied to that ship. This should give the correct number of ships sunk.
