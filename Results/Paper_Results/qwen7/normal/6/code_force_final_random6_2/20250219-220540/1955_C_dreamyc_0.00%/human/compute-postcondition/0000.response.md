Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a deque of n integers such that 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

Explanation: The code `nums = deque(nums)` changes the type of the `nums` list to a deque (double-ended queue). However, the values and constraints of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the elements of `nums` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated type of `nums` and retains the original constraints and values of the other variables.
