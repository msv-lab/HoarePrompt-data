### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided examples to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function processes the attacks on the ships.
   - It uses a deque to efficiently handle the first and last elements.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - It enters a loop that continues until there are fewer than 2 ships left or `k` attacks are exhausted.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and reduces both by this value.
   - It updates `k` by subtracting twice this minimum value.
   - If either `a` or `b` is still greater than 0, it appends them back to the deque or increments `ans` if they sink.
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is sufficient to sink it, it increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of remaining ships is less than 2, which would break the loop.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the last ship is the only one left and can be sunk with remaining attacks.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
  - `nums` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq nums[i] \leq 10^9\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\).

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `k > 0` and `len(nums) >= 2`.
  - **First Iteration**:
    - `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of `nums`.
    - `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.
    - If `k >= 2 * x`, both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`, and `k` is reduced by `2 * x`.
    - If `k < 2 * x`, the loop breaks.
  - **After Loop**:
    - If `len(nums) == 1` and `k >= nums[0]`, `ans` is incremented by 1.
    - Otherwise, `ans` is returned.
