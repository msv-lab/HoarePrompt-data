Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans` which is the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution, incremented by 1.**

This means that the program will return the count of occurrences where the last element (`b`) popped from the `nums` deque was less than or equal to 0, plus one.
