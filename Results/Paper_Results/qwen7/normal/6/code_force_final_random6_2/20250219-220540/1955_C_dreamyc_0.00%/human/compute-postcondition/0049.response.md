Output State: **`nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()` minus `x`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()` minus `x`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` minus `x`.**

Explanation: The code `b -= x` subtracts `x` from the value of `b`. Since `b` was previously the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, now `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()` minus `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
