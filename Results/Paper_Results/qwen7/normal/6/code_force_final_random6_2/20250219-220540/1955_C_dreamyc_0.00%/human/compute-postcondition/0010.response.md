Output State: **`a` is `a` minus `x`, `b` is `b` minus `x`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is `k` minus 2 times `x`, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `x`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
