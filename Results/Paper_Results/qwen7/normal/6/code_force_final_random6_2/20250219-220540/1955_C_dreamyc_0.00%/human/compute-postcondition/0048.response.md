Output State: **`nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()` minus `x`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is appended to `nums` if `ans` is 1 or `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `a -= x` subtracts `x` from `a`. The values of `nums`, `b`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The updated value of `a` is the original value of `a` minus `x`. The conditions for `b` and `ans` remain as specified.
