Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` is less than or equal to \(2 * x\), `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, `b` is appended to `nums`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums.append(b)` appends the last element of `nums` (which is `b`) to the deque `nums`. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, or `x`. The only change is that `b` is now added to the end of the deque `nums`.
