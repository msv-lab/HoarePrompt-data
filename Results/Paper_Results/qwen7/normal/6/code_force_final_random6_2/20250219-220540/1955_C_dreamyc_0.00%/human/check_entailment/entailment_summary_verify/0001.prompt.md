You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` represents the number of elements in `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. The function processes `nums` by repeatedly reducing pairs of elements until `k` becomes zero or `nums` contains fewer than two elements. During this process, it counts the number of times the second-to-last element (`b`) is reduced to zero or less. Finally, it returns this count, either incremented by one in a specific case or directly as the count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the attacks on the ships.
   - It uses a deque to efficiently handle the first and last elements.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - It enters a loop that continues until there are fewer than 2 ships left or `k` attacks are exhausted.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (`a` and `b`).
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and reduces both by this value.
   - It updates `k` by subtracting twice this minimum value.
   - If either `a` or `b` is still greater than 0, it appends them back to the deque or increments `ans` if they sink.
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and `k` is sufficient to sink it, it increments `ans` by 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of remaining ships is less than 2, which would break the loop.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the last ship is the only one left and can be sunk with remaining attacks.

### Testing the Logic:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `4 5 1 2 4 3`
- Output: `2`

- The program processes the attacks as follows:
  1. First attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 3]`
  2. Second attack: `3` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 2]`
  3. Third attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 2]`
  4. Fourth attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 1]`
  5. Fifth attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [4]`

- The final answer is `2` ships sunk, which matches the expected output.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `4 6 1 2 4 3`
- Output: `3`

- The program processes the attacks as follows:
  1. First attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 3]`
  2. Second attack: `3` sinks, `nums = [2, 4, 2]`
  3. Third attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 2]`
  4. Fourth attack: `2` sinks, `nums = [4, 1]`
  5. Fifth attack: `1` sinks, `nums = [4]`
  6. Sixth attack: `4` sinks, `nums = []`

- The final answer is `3` ships sunk, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
