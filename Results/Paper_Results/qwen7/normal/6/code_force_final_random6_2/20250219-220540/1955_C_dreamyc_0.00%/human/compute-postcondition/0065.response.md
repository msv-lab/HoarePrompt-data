Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution, either incremented by 1 or not, depending on the case.**
