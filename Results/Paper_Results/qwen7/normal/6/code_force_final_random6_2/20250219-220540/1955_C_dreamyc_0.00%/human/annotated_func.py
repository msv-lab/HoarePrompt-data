    #State: Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0 and the length of `nums` is at least 2. After all iterations, the following conditions hold:
    #
    #- `nums` will be a deque with elements reduced by pairs until either `k` becomes 0 or `nums` no longer has at least 2 elements.
    #- `a` will be the first element of `nums` after the final call to `popleft()`, and `b` will be the last element of `nums` after the final call to `pop()`.
    #- `ans` will be the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution.
    #- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
    #- `k` will be 0 if the loop terminates naturally (i.e., `k` becomes 0 due to the while loop condition), or it may be a non-negative value if the loop exits because `len(nums)` is less than 2.
    #- `n` and `k` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    #- `x` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` at the final iteration, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop.
    #- If `b` is greater than 0 after the loop, it will be appended to `nums`; otherwise, `ans` will have been incremented each time `b` became non-positive, indicating how many times `b` was reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution.
    #
    #In summary, the final state of `nums` will reflect the reduction process applied to its elements based on the value of `k`, and `ans` will indicate the cumulative count of times the second-to-last element (`b`) was reduced to 0 or less.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the value of `ans` which is the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution, incremented by 1.
    #State: `nums` will be a deque with elements reduced by pairs until either `k` becomes 0 or `nums` no longer has at least 2 elements. `a` will be the first element of `nums` after the final call to `popleft()`, and `b` will be the last element of `nums` after the final call to `pop()`. `ans` will be the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution. `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `k` will be 0 if the loop terminates naturally (i.e., `k` becomes 0 due to the while loop condition), or it may be a non-negative value if the loop exits because `len(nums)` is less than 2. `n` and `k` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop. `x` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` at the final iteration, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop. If `b` is greater than 0 after the loop, it will be appended to `nums`; otherwise, `ans` will have been incremented each time `b` became non-positive, indicating how many times `b` was reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution. The condition `(k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]))` is false.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of times 'b' was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` represents the number of elements in `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. The function processes `nums` by repeatedly reducing pairs of elements until `k` becomes zero or `nums` contains fewer than two elements. During this process, it counts the number of times the second-to-last element (`b`) is reduced to zero or less. Finally, it returns this count, either incremented by one in a specific case or directly as the count.
