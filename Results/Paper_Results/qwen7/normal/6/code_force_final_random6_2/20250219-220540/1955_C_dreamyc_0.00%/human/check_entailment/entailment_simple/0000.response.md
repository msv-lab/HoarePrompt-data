Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It converts the list `nums` into a deque, which allows efficient popping from both ends.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of ships that sink.
   - The main logic is in the `while` loop, where the Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately until `k` attacks are exhausted or `nums` has fewer than 2 ships left.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`a` and `b` respectively) and reduces both by this amount if possible.
   - It then checks if either of these ships has sunk and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - The loop continues until `k` attacks are used up or there are fewer than 2 ships left in `nums`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is large enough to sink all remaining ships, it handles this correctly by checking if `k` is still positive and if `nums` has exactly one ship left.
   - If `k` is insufficient to sink the last ship, it correctly returns the current value of `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the correct count of sunk ships for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
