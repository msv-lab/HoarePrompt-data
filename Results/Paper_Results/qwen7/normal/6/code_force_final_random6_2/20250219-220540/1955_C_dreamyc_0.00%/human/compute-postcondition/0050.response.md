Output State: **`k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `x`, `n` is at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b` minus `x`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ans` is either 1 or 2**.

This means that the value of `k` has been decreased by twice the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state conditions.
