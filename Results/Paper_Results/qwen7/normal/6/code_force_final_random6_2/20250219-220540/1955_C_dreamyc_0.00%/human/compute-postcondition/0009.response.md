Output State: **`a` is `a` minus `x`, `b` is `b` minus `x`, `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b -= x` subtracts the value of `x` from `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions regarding `a`, `nums`, `ans`, `t`, `k`, `n`, `x`, and the relationship between `k` and the minimum of `a` and `b` are still valid.
