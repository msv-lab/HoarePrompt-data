Output State: **`a` is the first element of `nums` after calling popleft(), `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling pop(), `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state, `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation:
- The `popleft()` method removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `nums`. Let's call this element `a`.
- The `pop()` method removes and returns the rightmost element of the deque `nums`. Let's call this element `b`.
- After these operations, the deque `nums` will have one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state.
- The variables `ans`, `t`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
