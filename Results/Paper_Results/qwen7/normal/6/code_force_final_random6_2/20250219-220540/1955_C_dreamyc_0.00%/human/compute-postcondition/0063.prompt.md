You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0 and the length of `nums` is at least 2. After all iterations, the following conditions hold:

- `nums` will be a deque with elements reduced by pairs until either `k` becomes 0 or `nums` no longer has at least 2 elements.
- `a` will be the first element of `nums` after the final call to `popleft()`, and `b` will be the last element of `nums` after the final call to `pop()`.
- `ans` will be the total count of times `b` was less than or equal to 0 during the loop's execution.
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `k` will be 0 if the loop terminates naturally (i.e., `k` becomes 0 due to the while loop condition), or it may be a non-negative value if the loop exits because `len(nums)` is less than 2.
- `n` and `k` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
- `x` will be the minimum of `a` and `b` at the final iteration, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop.
- If `b` is greater than 0 after the loop, it will be appended to `nums`; otherwise, `ans` will have been incremented each time `b` became non-positive, indicating how many times `b` was reduced to 0 or less during the loop's execution.

In summary, the final state of `nums` will reflect the reduction process applied to its elements based on the value of `k`, and `ans` will indicate the cumulative count of times the second-to-last element (`b`) was reduced to 0 or less.
if condition:
```
if (k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0])):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else. 
Provide the postcondition in Natural language easily understandable by humans. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
