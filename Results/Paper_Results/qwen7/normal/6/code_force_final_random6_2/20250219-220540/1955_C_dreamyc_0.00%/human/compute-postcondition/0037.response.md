Postcondition: **`a` is now `a - x` and `b` is `b - x` if `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`. Otherwise, `a` is the first element of `nums` after calling `popleft()`, `b` is the last element of `nums` after calling `pop()`, and `nums` is a deque with one less element at the beginning and one less element at the end compared to its original state. `ans` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `b` is less than or equal to 0 if `ans` is 2, otherwise `b` is appended to `nums`.**
