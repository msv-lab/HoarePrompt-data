Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `s` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `i` is the last character in the string `s`, and `neg` is the total count of '-' characters in the string `s`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., once for each character in the string `s`), the variable `neg` will hold the total number of '-' characters found in the string `s`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
