Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `i` is the third character in the string `s`, `neg` is `neg + 1`.**

The code `neg += 1` increments the value of `neg` by 1. Since `neg` was previously unchanged, it now has its original value plus one. The other variables remain in their initial state.
