Output State: The value of `neg` is equal to the total number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `neg` will hold the count of all '-' characters in the string `s`. This is because the loop iterates over each character in `s`, and for every '-' character encountered, it increments `neg` by 1. Therefore, `neg` will reflect the total count of '-' characters in the entire string `s`.
