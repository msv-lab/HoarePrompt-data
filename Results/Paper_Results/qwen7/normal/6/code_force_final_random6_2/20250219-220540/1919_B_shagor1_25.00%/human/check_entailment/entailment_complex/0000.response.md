Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
2. The annotated program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`, then counts the number of '-' characters (`neg`).
4. The program prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `n` (length of the array) is not equal to `neg` (count of `-`), the penalty calculation formula `n - 2 * neg` is used. This formula aims to balance the number of positive and negative elements to minimize the penalty.
- If `n` equals `neg`, the penalty is simply `n`. This occurs when the number of `+` and `-` are equal, making the sum of any subarray zero, thus having no penalty.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented, the program correctly implements the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
