Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, a is a list containing integers from 1 to t (inclusive), and n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive). The value of `t` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is not affected by this code snippet.
