Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) and an integer \( n \). For each test case, it generates a list of integers from 1 to \( t \), reverses every second element in the list, and prints the modified list. The final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the modified lists.**
