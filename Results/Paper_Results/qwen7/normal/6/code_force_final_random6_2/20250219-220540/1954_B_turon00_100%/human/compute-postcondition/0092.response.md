Output State: **`i` is less than `n`; `n` is an input integer; `tmp` has some value; `i` is incremented by 1; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i`, `n`, `tmp`, and the condition `i < n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated based on the current values of `ans` and `cnt`.
