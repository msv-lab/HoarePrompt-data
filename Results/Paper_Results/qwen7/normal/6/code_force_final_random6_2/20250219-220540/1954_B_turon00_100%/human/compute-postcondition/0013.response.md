Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is 0, and the element at index `i` in `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `n`, `a`, or the condition regarding the element at index `i` in `a` being not equal to `tmp`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged, and only `cnt` is updated to 0.
