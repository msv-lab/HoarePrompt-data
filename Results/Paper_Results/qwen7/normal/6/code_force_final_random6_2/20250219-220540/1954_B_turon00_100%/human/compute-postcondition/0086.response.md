Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` must be less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, and the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the smaller of its current value and `cnt`. The conditions involving `i`, `n`, and the element at index `i` in list `a` remain unchanged.
