Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. This means `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**:
   - If the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.
   - If the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `tmp` has some value.
   - Either `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, or `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `i` must be less than `n` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `tmp` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cnt` and `ans` may change based on the loop body, but since we don't know the exact values, we only need to ensure the conditions for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `i` is incremented by 1, and either `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, or `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.**
