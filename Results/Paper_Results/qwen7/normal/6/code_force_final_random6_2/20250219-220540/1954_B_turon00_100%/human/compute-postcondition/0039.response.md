Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The variable `ans` retains its previous state, which is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution. The variable `cnt` remains 0, and `t` is decreased by 1. The initial conditions about `n` and `ans` are preserved as per the given constraints.
