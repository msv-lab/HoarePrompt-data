### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and sets `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - When an element is different from `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final value of `cnt`.
   - If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the function calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements in the array \( a \).
   - If the array has only one element or the minimum count of consecutive identical elements equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum count.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the code only counts consecutive identical elements and does not consider the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition.
   - The code does not implement the necessary logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The given code does not solve the problem correctly. It only counts consecutive identical elements and does not provide the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
   - The code fails to handle the requirement of finding the minimum number of removals to make the array non-beautiful.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the code does not solve the problem as described. The code only counts consecutive identical elements and does not consider the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty condition.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.
