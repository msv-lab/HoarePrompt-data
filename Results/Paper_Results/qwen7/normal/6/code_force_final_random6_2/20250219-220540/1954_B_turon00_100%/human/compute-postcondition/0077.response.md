Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `initial_t - n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`cnt`, `n`, `t`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
