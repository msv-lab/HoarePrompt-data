Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution.
- `cnt` is initially set to 0.
- The condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` must hold true.

Given these conditions, let's break down the scenario:

1. **Initialization**: `cnt` starts at 0.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues to execute until either `n` becomes 1 or `ans` equals `n`. Since `ans` is initialized to the minimum value of `cnt` encountered so far, it will start at 0 if no other smaller value of `cnt` is found.
3. **Minimum Value**: The minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution will be 0 because `cnt` starts at 0 and there is no indication that any smaller value of `cnt` is encountered.
4. **Condition Check**: For the condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` to hold true, `n` cannot be 1 and `ans` cannot be equal to `n`.

Since `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` and `cnt` starts at 0, `ans` will remain 0 unless a smaller value of `cnt` is encountered. Given the condition, `ans` will not change from 0.

Therefore, the value of `ans` will be 0.

Output: **0**
