Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `cnt` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, and `ans` will hold the minimum value between its initial value (`n`) and all the values of `cnt` encountered during the loop iterations.

In simpler terms, `i` will be equal to the total number of elements in the list `a` (which is `n`), `cnt` will be 0, and `ans` will be the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`.
