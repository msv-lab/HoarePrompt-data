Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
   - Either `cnt` is increased by 1 when `a[i]` equals `tmp`, or `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` when `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented from its previous value. Let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev` and the new value of `i` as `i_new`. Given that `i_new = i_prev + 1`, we know that `i_new < n` because `i_prev < n` and incrementing `i_prev` by 1 keeps it within the bounds of the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i_prev` was the value at the end of the previous iteration, then `i_new = i_prev + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n`, and `n` itself does not change within the loop.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` and `cnt` are updated within the loop body but their values are not directly reflected in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `ans` and `cnt` are updated according to the loop body logic.** 

Since we cannot provide specific values for `ans` and `cnt` without knowing the exact loop body, we focus on the variables in the loop head.

Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.
