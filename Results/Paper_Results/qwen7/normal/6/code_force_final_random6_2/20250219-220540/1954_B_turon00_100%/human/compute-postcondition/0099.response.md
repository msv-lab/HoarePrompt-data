Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 0**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This initializes `cnt` to 0, which means that the count of occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a` starting from index `i` will be reset to 0. The other variables (`n`, `tmp`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
