Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function.
2. The function processes each test case as follows:
   - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the current element (`tmp`), the count of consecutive identical elements (`cnt`), and the minimum count of consecutive identical elements (`ans`).
   - It iterates through the array, updating `cnt` and `ans` accordingly.
   - After the loop, it checks if the array has only one element or if the minimum count of consecutive identical elements equals the length of the array. If so, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count.
3. The function handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement correctly.
4. The state of the program after processing all test cases matches the description: \( t \) is set to 0, and the variable `ans` holds the result for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
