Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ans` will hold the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, and `cnt` will be 0.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached `n`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `cnt` will be reset to 0 at the end of the loop since it is reset to 0 whenever `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`. The variable `ans` will contain the minimum value of `cnt` that was recorded during the loop's execution, as it gets updated to the minimum value between itself and `cnt` every time `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`.
