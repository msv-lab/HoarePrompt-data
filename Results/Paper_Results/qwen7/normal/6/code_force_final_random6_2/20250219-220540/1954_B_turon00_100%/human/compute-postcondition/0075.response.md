Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `n` is 0 or 1
   - `t` is `initial_t - n`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`
   - `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`
   - `i` is `n-1`

3. **Condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is `initial_t - n`, and `n` is either 0 or 1, `t` will be either `initial_t` or `initial_t - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `cnt` remains 0 (unchanged)
- `n` remains 0 or 1 (unchanged)
- `t` is now `initial_t - n - 1`
- `a` remains the same list of integers (unchanged)
- `tmp` remains equal to `a[0]` (unchanged)
- `ans` remains the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a` (unchanged)
- `i` remains `n-1` (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is 0 or 1, `t` is `initial_t - n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`**
