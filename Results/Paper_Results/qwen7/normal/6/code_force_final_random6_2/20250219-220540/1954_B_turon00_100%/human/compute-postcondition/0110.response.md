Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether the given array a is beautiful according to the specified conditions.**

This means the function is designed to validate a series of test cases, each containing a specific number of elements in an array, ensuring the array meets certain criteria to be considered "beautiful."
