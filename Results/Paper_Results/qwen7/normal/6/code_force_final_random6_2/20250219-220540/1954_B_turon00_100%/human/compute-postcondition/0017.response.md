Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt` + 1**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was previously `i_prev + 1`, it remains unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented `cnt`.
