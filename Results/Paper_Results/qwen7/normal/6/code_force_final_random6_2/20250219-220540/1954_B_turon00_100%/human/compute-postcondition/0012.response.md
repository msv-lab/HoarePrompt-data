Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` in `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The conditions for `n`, the list `a`, and the element at index `i` in `a` being not equal to `tmp` remain unchanged.
