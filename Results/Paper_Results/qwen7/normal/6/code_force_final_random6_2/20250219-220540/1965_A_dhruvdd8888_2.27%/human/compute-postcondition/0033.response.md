Output State: **`cd` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `cd` will be the count of consecutive pairs in the `nums` list (excluding the additional 0 at the beginning) where the difference between the two numbers in each pair is exactly 1. The value of `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `N` remains unchanged as an input integer, and `nums` remains a sorted list with an additional 0 at the beginning. The length of `nums` is guaranteed to be at least 3. The variable `i` will be one more than the last index checked in the loop, which means it will be the index just beyond the last pair of numbers in `nums` that were compared.
