Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `nums.insert(0, 0)` inserts the value `0` at the beginning of the list `nums`. Since `nums` was initially a list of integers sorted in ascending order and had more than 2 elements, after inserting `0`, the list remains sorted (as `0` is less than any positive number) and its length increases by 1. Therefore, the length of `nums` is now greater than 2. All other variables (`t` and `N`) remain unchanged.
