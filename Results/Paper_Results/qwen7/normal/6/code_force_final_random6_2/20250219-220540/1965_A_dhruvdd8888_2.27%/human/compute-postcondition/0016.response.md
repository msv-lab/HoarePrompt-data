Postcondition: `cd` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, and the length of `nums` must be at least 3. The current value of `nums[i + 1] - nums[i]` is equal to 1.
