Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the loop. This means the loop will run based on the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input
   - `b[n-2]` is not '<'
   - `a` remains unchanged

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations must increase by 1. This is determined by the input provided to `int(input())`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - The variable `t` will be updated to the next integer input.
   - The variable `n` will remain unchanged.
   - The list `b` will remain unchanged.
   - The variable `a` will remain unchanged.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` remains unchanged**
