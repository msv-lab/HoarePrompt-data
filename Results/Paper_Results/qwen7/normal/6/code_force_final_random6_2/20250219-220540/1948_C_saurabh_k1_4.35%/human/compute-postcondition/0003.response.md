Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(str, input()))` takes an input from the user, converts each character of the input into a string, and then assigns these strings to the list `b`. The variable `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` remains an input integer, and `b` becomes a list of strings corresponding to the characters of the input.
