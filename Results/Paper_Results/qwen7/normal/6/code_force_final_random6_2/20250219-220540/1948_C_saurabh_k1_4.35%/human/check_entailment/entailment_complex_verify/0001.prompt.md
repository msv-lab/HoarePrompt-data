You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer input such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input, and `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the last input. The string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'. The loop has executed for all test cases provided, and for each test case, if the condition `b[n-2] != '<'` was met, it printed 'Yes', otherwise it printed 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. For each test case, it checks if the second last character of the second string is not '<'. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a robot starting at cell (1, 1) can reach cell (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in the grid.
2. **Key Points**:
   - The robot can only move left, right, up, or down within the grid.
   - After moving to a new cell, the robot follows the arrow in that cell.
   - The grid has 2 rows and \(n\) columns.
   - Arrows are represented by `<` (left) and `>` (right).
   - Additional constraints include \(n\) being even, and the sum of \(n\) over all test cases not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size \(n\) of the grid.
   - It reads the two rows of the grid as lists of strings.
   - The code checks if the last but one column's arrow in the second row (`b[n-2]`) is a left arrow (`<`).
     - If it is a left arrow, the robot cannot move right from that position and thus cannot reach the last column (2, n).
     - Otherwise, the robot can potentially reach the last column.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the given code is flawed because it does not account for all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The code only checks one specific condition (the last but one column's arrow in the second row), which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
   - The code does not simulate the robot's movement through the grid or consider other possible paths.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: **False**
