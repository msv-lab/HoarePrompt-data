Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input.
- The string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<'.
- `a` remains unchanged and is a list of strings obtained from a previous input.
- `b` is updated to be a list of strings from the new input.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string `'No'` without any modifications or additional context based on the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **No**
