Output State: **`t` is the next integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, the string at index `n-2` in `b` is not '<', `a` is a list of characters from the new input string**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(str, input()))` takes a new input string, converts each character in the string to a string (which is redundant since they are already strings), and assigns the resulting list of characters to `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `b`) remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
