Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The robot must start at cell (1, 1) and follow the arrows to potentially reach cell (2, n). The program only checks if the second last character of the second row (`b[n-2]`) is not '<'. This check is insufficient because it does not account for the robot's movement pattern and the direction of arrows throughout the entire grid.

2. **Movement Pattern**: The robot needs to move both horizontally and vertically based on the arrows. Simply checking the second last character of the second row does not guarantee that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   4
   >><<
   >>><
   ```
   According to the program, since `b[2]` (the second character of the second row) is '>', it would print 'Yes'. However, the correct path should be (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4), which means the robot can indeed reach (2, 4). But the program's logic does not cover this scenario comprehensively.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct solution would involve simulating the robot's movements through the grid, ensuring it follows the arrows and reaches the target cell (2, n). This requires tracking the robot's position and direction changes accurately.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
