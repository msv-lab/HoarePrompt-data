Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to use sets to check for the existence of elements within specified ranges and then tries to determine if there are two different elements within those ranges. However, the logic used to determine the presence of different elements is flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output for this input should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This is incorrect because for the query `1 2`, there are no two different elements in the range `[1, 2]`. The program incorrectly returns `1 3` for the query `1 3` because it checks the entire range from `1` to `3` instead of just the sub-range `[1, 3]`.

The program also does not handle the queries correctly for ranges that do not contain enough elements to satisfy the condition. For example, for the query `1 2`, the program should output `-1 -1` since there are no two different elements in the range `[1, 2]`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
