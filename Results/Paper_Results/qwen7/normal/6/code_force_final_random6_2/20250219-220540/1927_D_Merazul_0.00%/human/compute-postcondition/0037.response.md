Output State: **`t` is equal to its original value minus 1, `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()`, `b` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2`, `n` is `k // 2**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. Since `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `m` and `n` are both set to `k // 2`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
