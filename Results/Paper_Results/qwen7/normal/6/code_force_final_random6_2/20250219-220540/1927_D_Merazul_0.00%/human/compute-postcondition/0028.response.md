Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * k`, `k` must be at least `i_prev + 2`, `i` is `i_prev + k`, `a` is a set containing one element from `R()`, `b` is a set containing one element from `R()`, `f` is `f & (u | v) ** k times**`, `m` is `k // 2 - (u & ~v) * (k - 1)`, `n` is `k // 2 - (~u & v) * (k - 1)`, `u` is `i in a`, `v` is `i in b`.

In this final state, `t` has been decremented by 2 for each iteration of the loop, resulting in a total decrement of `2 * k`. The variable `k` reflects the total number of iterations completed, which is `i_prev + k`. The variable `f` is the result of the bitwise AND operation applied `k` times on the expression `(u | v)`. The variables `m` and `n` are adjusted based on the values of `u` and `v` for each iteration, with `m` decreasing by `(u & ~v)` for each iteration and `n` decreasing by `(~u & v)` for each iteration.
