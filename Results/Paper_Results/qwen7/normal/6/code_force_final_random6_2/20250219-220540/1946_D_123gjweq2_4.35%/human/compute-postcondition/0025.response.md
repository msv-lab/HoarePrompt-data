Output State: **All elements in `new_arr` are unique values of `xor` computed for each segment of `cur_arr` as `xor` is reset to 0 after each append operation. `cur_arr` is empty.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `cur_arr` will be empty because the loop continues to process elements until `cur_arr` is exhausted. For each segment of `cur_arr`, the variable `xor` is updated by XORing all elements in the segment. If the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` is met (i.e., the specified bit in `xor` is 0), `xor` is appended to `new_arr` and then reset to 0. This process repeats until all elements in `cur_arr` have been processed. Therefore, `new_arr` will contain all the unique values of `xor` computed for each segment of `cur_arr` before `xor` was reset to 0.
