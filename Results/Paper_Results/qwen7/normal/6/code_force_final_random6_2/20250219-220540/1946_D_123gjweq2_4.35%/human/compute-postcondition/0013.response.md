Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cur_arr` contains at least one element.
   - `xor` is 0.
   - `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`.
   - The loop body is omitted but based on the postcondition, if `not xor >> bit & 1` is true, then `new_arr` is added to `cur_arr`.

3. **Key Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` (which represents an element from `cur_arr`).
   - The loop itself depends on the length of `cur_arr`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop iterates over elements in `cur_arr`, the length of `cur_arr` will decrease by one with each iteration.
   - `xor` and `new_arr` are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the loop's execution.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must still contain at least one element.
   - `xor` and `new_arr` remain as they are unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- The length of `cur_arr` decreases by one.
- `xor` and `new_arr` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`cur_arr` contains at least one element (length reduced by one), `xor` is 0, `new_arr` contains the value of `xor`**.
