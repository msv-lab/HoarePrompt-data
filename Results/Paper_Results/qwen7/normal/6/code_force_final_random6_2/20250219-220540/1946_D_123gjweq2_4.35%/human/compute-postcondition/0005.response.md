Output State: **xor is 0, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current segment of the array being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (0 <= bit < 30), and thing1 is 0.**

The code initializes `thing1` to 0, which does not affect the values of `xor`, `cur_arr`, `bit`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
