Output State: **`new_arr` contains unique values of `xor` computed for each segment of `cur_arr` as `xor` is reset to 0 after each append operation, `cur_arr` is empty, `thing1` is the maximum value from `new_arr` with index `bit - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` calls the function `find_max` with `new_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments. This function returns the maximum value from `new_arr` at the index `bit - 1`. Since `cur_arr` is empty and `xor` is reset to 0 after each append operation, `new_arr` remains unchanged. The variable `thing1` is assigned the maximum value from `new_arr` at the index `bit - 1`.
