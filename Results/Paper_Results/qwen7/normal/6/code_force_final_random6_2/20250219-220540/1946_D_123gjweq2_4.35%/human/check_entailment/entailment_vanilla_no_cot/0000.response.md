Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using a divide-and-conquer approach, but there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Bitwise Operations**: The function `find_max` is trying to split the array based on the current bit position. However, the logic for determining whether to include elements in the new array (`new_arr`) is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if not xor >> bit & 1:` is incorrect because it checks if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, which is not what we need. We should check if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is set (i.e., `xor >> bit & 1`).

2. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls to `find_max` are not correctly handling the conditions for returning the maximum value. The logic for choosing between `len(new_arr)` and `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` is incorrect. We need to ensure that the bitwise OR condition is satisfied for the segments.

3. **Base Case Handling**: The base case for the recursion (`bit == -1`) is not correctly handled. It should return the length of the current array, but the function returns `len(cur_arr)` directly without considering the segments.

4. **Final Check**: The final check in the main function `func_1` calls `find_max` with `bit = 31`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of their XORs is less than or equal to `x`. This should be done by iterating over all possible segment lengths.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    def find_max(arr, x, bit):
        if bit < 0:
            return 0
        
        # Initialize variables
        dp = [0] * (len(arr) + 1)
        prefix_xor = 0
        max_segments = 0
        
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            prefix_xor ^= arr[i]
            if bit >= 0 and (prefix_xor >> bit & 1):
                prefix_xor ^= (1 << (bit + 1)) - 1
            
            # Find the last position where the prefix XOR is the same
            pos = dp[prefix_xor ^ (1 << (bit + 1)) - 1] if bit >= 0 else 0
            dp[prefix_xor] = max(dp[prefix_xor], pos + 1)
            
            # Update max_segments
            max_segments = max(max_segments, dp[prefix_xor])
        
        return max_segments
    
    # Iterate over all possible segment lengths
    result = -1
    for length in range(1, len(arr) + 1):
        result = max(result, find_max(arr, x, 30 - (length - 1).bit_length()))
    
    return result

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr, x))
```

This solution iterates over all possible segment lengths and uses dynamic programming to find the maximum number of segments that satisfy the given conditions.
