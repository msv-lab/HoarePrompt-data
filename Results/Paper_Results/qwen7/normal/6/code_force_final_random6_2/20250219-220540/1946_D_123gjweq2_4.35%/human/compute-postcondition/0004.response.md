Output State: **xor is 0, cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers representing the current segment of the array being processed, and bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (0 <= bit < 30). The value of bit is not -1; new_arr is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
