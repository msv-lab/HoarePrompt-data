Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`.
- `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.
- `cur_arr` contains the length reduced by one.
- If `xor` shifted right by `bit` bits and bitwise AND with 1 is 0, then `xor` becomes 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in cur_arr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `cur_arr`.
   - The variable `i` represents the current element being processed in the loop.

2. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `cur_arr`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is used within the loop body but not directly in the loop head, its value does not need to be adjusted here.
   - The key variables in the loop head are `cur_arr` and `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cur_arr` has had its length reduced by one.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must still contain at least one element (i.e., its length must be greater than 0).

5. **New State:**
   - `xor` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `new_arr` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `cur_arr` must now have a length of at least 1.

### Final State:
- `xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`.
- `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.
- `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`xor` is equal to the first element of `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it, and `cur_arr` must have a length of at least 1.**
