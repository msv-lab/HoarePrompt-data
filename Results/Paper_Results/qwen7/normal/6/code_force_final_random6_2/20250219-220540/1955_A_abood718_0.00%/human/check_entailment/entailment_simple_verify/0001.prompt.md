You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, where n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to the total number of test cases entered. For each test case, the value of `A` is the last input integer provided, `B` is the second input integer, and `C` is the third input integer. Depending on the conditions met within the loop:
    #
    #- If `B * 2 < C`, the output for that test case was `A * B`.
    #- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the output for that test case was `int(A * C / 2)`.
    #- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the output for that test case was `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.
    #
    #The final state of the loop will reflect these outputs for each test case, with `i` being the total number of iterations completed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
     - Otherwise, it's cheaper to use the promotion.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, it calculates the total cost using the promotion price:
     - `print(int(A * C / 2))`
     - This is correct because buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price will cover all `A` yogurts.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, it splits the calculation into:
     - Buying `X` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - Buying one additional yogurt at the individual price.
   - However, the program incorrectly prints `X` before calculating the final cost:
     - `print(X)`
     - `print(X * C + B)`
     - This is incorrect because it should directly compute and print the total cost without an intermediate print statement.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to remove the intermediate print statement and directly calculate and print the total cost for odd numbers of yogurts.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in handling the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. It prints an intermediate value which is not required. After fixing this, the program should work correctly.

**Correctness: False**
