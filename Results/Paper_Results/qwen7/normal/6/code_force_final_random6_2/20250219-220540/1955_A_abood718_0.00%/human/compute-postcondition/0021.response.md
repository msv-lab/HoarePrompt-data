Output State: **`i` is 1, `A` is an integer from the input, `B` is an integer from the input, `C` is an integer from the input, `X` is `A // 2`**.

This means that the variable `X` is assigned the value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division (//), while the values of `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial states.
