Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Promotional Price Check**: The program correctly checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than the price for one yogurt (`a`). If `b < 2*a`, it directly calculates the cost as `A * B` (where `A` is `n`).

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If `b >= 2*a` and the number of yogurts `A` is even, the program correctly calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`. This is because buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price would be the most cost-effective way.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If `b >= 2*a` and the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program correctly calculates the cost by splitting the yogurts into as many pairs as possible and then adding the price of the remaining single yogurt. Specifically, it calculates the cost as `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated cost for each test case, which is correct according to the problem requirements.

6. **Loop Execution**: The loop executes for all test cases, and the calculations and outputs are performed as expected.

Given the above points, the program logic aligns with the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
