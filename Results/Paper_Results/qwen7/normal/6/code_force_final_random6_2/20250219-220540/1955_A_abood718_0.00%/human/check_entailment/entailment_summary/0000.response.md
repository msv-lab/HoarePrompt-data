Reasoning:
- The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified.
- It takes into account the conditions for using the promotional price versus the individual price.
- The logic for handling the promotional price when `B * 2 < C` is correct.
- The logic for handling the case when `A % 2 == 0` is also correct, as it calculates the cost by dividing the number of yogurts by 2 and multiplying by the promotional price for two yogurts.
- However, there is an issue with the last part of the code where it prints `X` before calculating the final cost. This is unnecessary and incorrect because it should directly print the calculated cost without printing `X`.

Given this, the program should be modified to remove the unnecessary print statement for `X`. Despite this minor issue, the core logic of the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
