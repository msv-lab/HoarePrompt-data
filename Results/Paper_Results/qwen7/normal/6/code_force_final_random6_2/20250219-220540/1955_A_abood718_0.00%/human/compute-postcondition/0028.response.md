Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is 1
   - `A` is an integer from the input
   - `B` is an integer from the input
   - `C` is an integer from the input
   - If `B * 2 < C`, the postcondition remains the same.
   - Otherwise, if `A` is even, the postcondition remains the same.
   - If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of an integer input. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the integer input.

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `2`.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`A`, `B`, `C`, and `X`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop based on the given conditions.

5. **New State**: The new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `A` is an integer from the input, `B` is an integer from the input, `C` is an integer from the input, `X` is set to `A // 2` if `A` is odd (otherwise `X` remains unchanged)**. 

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the loop head only involves `i`, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 2**.
