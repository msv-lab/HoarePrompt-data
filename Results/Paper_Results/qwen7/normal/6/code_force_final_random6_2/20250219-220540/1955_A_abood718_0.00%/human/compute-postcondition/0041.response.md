Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b). For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy n yogurts based on the given prices and promotional offer. If the promotional price for two yogurts is cheaper than the individual price, it uses the promotional price to calculate the cost. Otherwise, it checks if the number of yogurts is even or odd to determine the optimal way to minimize the cost. The function does not return any value but prints the total cost for each test case.**
