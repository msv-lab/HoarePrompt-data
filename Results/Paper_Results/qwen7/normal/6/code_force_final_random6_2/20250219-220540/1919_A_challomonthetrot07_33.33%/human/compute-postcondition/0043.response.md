Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `T-1`.

3. **What Happens Inside the Loop:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know the conditions based on the problem statement:
     - If `a == b`, then `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
     - If `a != b`, then:
       - If `a` is odd, `a` remains unchanged.
       - If `a` is even, `a` becomes greater than `b`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The values of `T`, `a`, and `b` do not change within the loop unless specified otherwise.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only variable that changes is `i`, which will be incremented to 1.
   - The values of `T`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, and `b` is an input integer.**
