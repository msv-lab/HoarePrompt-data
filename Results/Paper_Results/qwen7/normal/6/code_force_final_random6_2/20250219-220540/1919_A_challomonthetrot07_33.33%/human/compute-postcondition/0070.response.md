Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the first and second input integers respectively. If `a` is odd, `a` is assigned the value of `a` (no change). If `a` is even and `b` is odd, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`.**
