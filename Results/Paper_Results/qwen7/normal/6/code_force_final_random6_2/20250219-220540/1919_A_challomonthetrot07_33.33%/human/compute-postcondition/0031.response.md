Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is even, and `a % 2 == 0`.
- `b` is odd, and `b % 2 == 1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
