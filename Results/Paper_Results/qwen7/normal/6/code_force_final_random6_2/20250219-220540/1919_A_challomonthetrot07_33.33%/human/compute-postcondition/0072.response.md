Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are the first and second input integers respectively. If `b` equals 1, `a` and `b` retain their original values. Otherwise, if `a` is odd, `a` retains its original value. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, `a` and `b` retain their original values. In all other cases, `a` and `b` retain their original values.**
