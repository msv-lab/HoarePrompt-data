You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it determines whether "Alice" or "Bob" should win based on specific conditions related to \(a\) and \(b\). After processing all test cases, it prints the winner for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Analysis**:
   - The given program handles different scenarios based on the values of `a` and `b`:
     - If `a == b`, it prints "Bob".
     - If `a == 1`, it prints "Alice".
     - If `b == 1`, it prints "Bob".
     - If `a % 2 == 1`, it prints "Bob".
     - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, it prints "Alice".
     - If `a > b`, it prints "Bob".
     - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To determine the winner, we need to consider the optimal moves for both players.
   - If both players play optimally, the key observation is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of coins in the wallets plays a crucial role.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `a == b`, the player whose turn it is will lose because they cannot make a valid move after the other player also makes a valid move.
   - **Case 2**: If `a == 1`, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by removing her last coin and then swapping wallets.
   - **Case 3**: If `b == 1`, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by removing his last coin and then swapping wallets.
   - **Case 4**: If `a % 2 == 1`, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring she keeps an odd number of coins.
   - **Case 5**: If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by ensuring he keeps an odd number of coins.
   - **Case 6**: If `a > b`, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by ensuring he keeps more coins than Alice.
   - **Case 7**: Otherwise, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring she keeps more coins than Bob.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the logic implemented in the function.
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy for both players.
