Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `T` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
