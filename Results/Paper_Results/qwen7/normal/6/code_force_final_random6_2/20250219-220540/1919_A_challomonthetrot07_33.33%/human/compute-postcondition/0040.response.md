Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is 1, then the function does not change `a` and `b`. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is either 1 or not equal to 1, with `a` remaining unchanged if it is odd, or becoming greater than `b` if it is even.**
