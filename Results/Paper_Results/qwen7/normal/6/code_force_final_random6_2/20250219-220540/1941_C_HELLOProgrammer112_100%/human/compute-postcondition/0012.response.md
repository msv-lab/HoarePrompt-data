Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0; `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.**

The code `z = s.count('mapie')` updates the value of `z` to the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
