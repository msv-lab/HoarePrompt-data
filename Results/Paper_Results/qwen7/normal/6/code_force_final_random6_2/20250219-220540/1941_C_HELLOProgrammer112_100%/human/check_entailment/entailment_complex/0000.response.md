Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string \(s\). However, the logic used to determine the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful is flawed. Specifically, the expression `x + y - z` does not correctly account for the minimum deletions required.

To make the string beautiful, we need to ensure that neither "pie" nor "map" appears in the string. The approach should be to remove all instances of "pie" and "map" while considering overlapping cases where "mapie" might cover parts of these substrings. Here's why the current logic is incorrect:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The code correctly counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie".
2. **Logic Flaw**: The expression `x + y - z` assumes that every instance of "mapie" covers one occurrence of "map" and one occurrence of "pie". This is not always true because "mapie" can overlap with "map" or "pie" in ways that reduce the actual number of deletions needed.

For example, consider the string "mapmap":
- Count of "map": 2
- Count of "pie": 0
- Count of "mapie": 1

Using the current logic, the output would be `2 + 0 - 1 = 1`, but the correct answer is 2 because both "map" instances need to be removed.

To fix this, we need to iterate through the string and remove characters directly, ensuring that we do not double-count overlaps.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
