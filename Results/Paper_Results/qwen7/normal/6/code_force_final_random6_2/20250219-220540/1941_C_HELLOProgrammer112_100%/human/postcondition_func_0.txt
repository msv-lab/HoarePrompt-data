The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \(a\) and a string \(s\). For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in \(s\), and prints the result of adding the counts of 'map' and 'pie' and then subtracting the count of 'mapie'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final result for the last input string \(s\).
