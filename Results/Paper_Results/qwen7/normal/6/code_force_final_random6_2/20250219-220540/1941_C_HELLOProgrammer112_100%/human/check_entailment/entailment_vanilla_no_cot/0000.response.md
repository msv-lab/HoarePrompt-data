Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The logic `x + y - z` is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to avoid both "pie" and "map" substrings simultaneously.

To solve this problem correctly, we should iterate through the string and keep track of whether we have encountered "map" or "pie". We need to ensure that we do not count overlapping substrings multiple times and remove the minimum number of characters necessary. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        count = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if 'pie' in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find('pie')
                end = start + 3
                count += len(s[i:i+start])  # Count characters before 'pie'
                i += end  # Move past 'pie'
            elif 'map' in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find('map')
                end = start + 3
                count += len(s[i:i+start])  # Count characters before 'map'
                i += end  # Move past 'map'
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that we correctly identify and remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
