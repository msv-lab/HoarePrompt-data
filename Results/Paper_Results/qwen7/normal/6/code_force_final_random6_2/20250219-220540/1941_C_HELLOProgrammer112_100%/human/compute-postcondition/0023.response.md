Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string s of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it returns information about the string s based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a test count `t` and a string `s`. It processes each test case individually, where `t` indicates the number of strings to process, and `s` is the string whose properties are to be determined. The function does not return a single value but processes and returns information for each string in the test cases.
