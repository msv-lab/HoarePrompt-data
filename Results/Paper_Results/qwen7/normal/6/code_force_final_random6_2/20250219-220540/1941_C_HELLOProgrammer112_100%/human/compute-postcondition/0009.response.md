Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `num_iterations` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` replaces the current value of `s` with a new string input by the user. All other variables (`a`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `num_iterations`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
