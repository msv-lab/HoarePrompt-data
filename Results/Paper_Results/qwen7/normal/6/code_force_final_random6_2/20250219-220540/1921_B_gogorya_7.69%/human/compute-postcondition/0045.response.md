Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `a1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s1`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` to `res`. Since `a2` is not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet, it remains undefined. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `a1`, and `hd`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
