Output State: **`hd` is an integer greater than 0 and is now equal to `hd - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', and we continue the loop.**

This means that the variable `hd` is decremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `res` is incremented by 1 if the conditions `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` are met. The loop continues without changing the values of `n`.
