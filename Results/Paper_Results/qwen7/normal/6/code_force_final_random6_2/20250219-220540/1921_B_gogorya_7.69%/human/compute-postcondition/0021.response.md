Output State: **`hd` is an integer greater than 0 and is now equal to `hd - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before, `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `hd` is decremented by 1, making it `hd - 1`.
- The variable `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.
- The variable `res` is incremented by 1 if the condition `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' holds true. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
