Output State: **`hd` is an integer greater than 0, now equal to `hd - 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the only change is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration. The value of `hd` is updated to `hd - 1` from the initial state, and the `continue` statement does not affect the other variables.
