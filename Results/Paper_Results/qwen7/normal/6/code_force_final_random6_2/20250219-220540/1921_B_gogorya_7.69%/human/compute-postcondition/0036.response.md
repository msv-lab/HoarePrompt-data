Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `hd` is 0 because it was decremented until it reached 0. The value of `res` is the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has processed every index up to `n-1`. The variable `hd` will be 0 since it was decremented each time `hd > 0`. The variable `res` will hold the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
