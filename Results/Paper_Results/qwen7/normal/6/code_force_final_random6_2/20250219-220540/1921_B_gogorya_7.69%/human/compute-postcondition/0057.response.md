Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hd` is decreased by 2.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `res` is 1 if the current value of `s1[i]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `hd` is decreased by 2, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state adjustments for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - `hd` will be decreased by 2 (as per the postcondition).
   - `t` will be 0.
   - `res` will be 1 if the current value of `s1[1]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[1]` is '0'. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`hd` is decreased by 2, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `res` is 1 if the current value of `s1[1]` is '1' and the current value of `s2[1]` is '0'. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
