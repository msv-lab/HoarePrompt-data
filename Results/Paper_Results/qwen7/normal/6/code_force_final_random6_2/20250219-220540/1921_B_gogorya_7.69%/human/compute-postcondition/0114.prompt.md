Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    a1 = s1.count('1')
    a2 = s2.count('1')
    hd = a1 - a2
    res = abs(a1 - a2)
    for i in range(n):
        if hd > 0:
            hd -= 1
            continue
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            res += 1
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `hd` is 0 because it was decremented until it reached 0. The value of `res` is the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `hd` is decreased by the total count of occurrences where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed (which is `n`), `i` is `n-1`, and `res` is the total count of occurrences where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` in the range of `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `hd` will be equal to `a1 - a2 - n`, `res` will be the total count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`, and `t` will remain 0. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` will remain unchanged from their initial values.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `i` will be `n`, `hd` will reflect the difference between the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` minus the number of iterations (`n`), `res` will contain the count of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' for all characters from the end of the strings to the beginning, and `t` will still be 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
