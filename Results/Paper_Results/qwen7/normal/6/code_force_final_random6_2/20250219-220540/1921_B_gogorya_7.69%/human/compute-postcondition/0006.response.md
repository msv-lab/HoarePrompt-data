Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is a string input by the user, `s2` is a string input by the user, `a1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s2`**.

The code `a2 = s2.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s2` and assigns the result to the variable `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
