Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All characters in the string `s` have been processed, and the value of `ps` is less than `n`
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `us` must contain at least one character. If `i` is an element not present in the set `win`, then the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `us` must contain at least one character, and `i` must be an element of `win`. If `i` is not in `win`, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `us` must contain at least one character, and `i` must be an element of `win`. If `i` is not in `win`, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
