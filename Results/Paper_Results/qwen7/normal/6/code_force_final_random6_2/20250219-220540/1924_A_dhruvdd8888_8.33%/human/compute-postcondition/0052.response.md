Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an internal string `s` consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets of length m. It also iterates through a list of test cases where each test case contains integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). For each test case, if the string `s` meets certain conditions, the function prints 'YES'.**

Note: The function does not return any value explicitly but performs an action (printing 'YES') based on the given conditions.
