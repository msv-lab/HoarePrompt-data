Output State: **`i` is added to the set `win`, `s` is the original string, `us` is unchanged, `win` is now a set containing the elements `i`, `ans[0]`, and `ps` is now `ps + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ps += 1` increments the value of `ps` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ps` is updated to its original value plus 1, while `i`, `win`, `s`, `us`, and `ans` retain their previous values.
