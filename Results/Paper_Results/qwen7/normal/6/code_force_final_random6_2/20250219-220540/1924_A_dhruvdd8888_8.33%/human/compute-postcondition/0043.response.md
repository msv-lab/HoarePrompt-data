The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `us`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being an element of the set `win`. At the end of the last iteration, `us` must contain at least one character. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is an element of `win`.

Since the loop continues to execute as long as `i` is in `win`, and `us` must contain at least one character, we need to ensure that `us` still contains at least one character and that `i` is an element of `win` for the loop to continue.

State: **`us` must contain at least one character, and `i` must be an element of `win`**
