Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, s is a string entered by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
