### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given two integers \( n \) and \( k \) along with a string \( s \).
- Check if all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of \( s \).
- If not, print "NO" and a string of length \( n \) that does not occur as a subsequence of \( s \).
- If yes, print "YES".

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \) from the input.
   - Reads the string \( s \) of length \( m \).
   - Uses a set `us` to store the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
   - Uses a set `win` to track the characters seen so far from `us`.
   - Uses a list `ans` to store the sequence of characters found in `s` that match `us`.
   - Iterates through `s` and adds characters to `win` if they are in `us`.
   - Clears `win` once `k` characters have been found.
   - Checks if the length of `ans` is at least \( n \). If so, prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` with additional characters from `us` to form a string of length \( n \).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes a string `s` and checks if it contains at least \( n \) unique characters from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets.
- If the condition is met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO" and appends any missing characters from `us` to `ans`, followed by 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length \( n \) can be formed as a subsequence of \( s \). The current logic only checks if a sequence of length \( k \) exists in \( s \), which is insufficient.
2. **Missing Subsequence Check**: The program does not ensure that every combination of \( n \) characters from the first \( k \) alphabets is a subsequence of \( s \). It only checks if a specific sequence of length \( k \) is present.
3. **Incorrect Output**: In the example provided in the original assessment, the program outputs "NO" and "aa" for the input "aabbccabab", which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check if every possible combination of \( n \) characters from the first \( k \) alphabets can be found as a subsequence in \( s \).
- This requires a more complex algorithm, such as using dynamic programming or a backtracking approach to verify all possible subsequences.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly check if all possible strings of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of \( s \).
