Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, which is the current character being processed from the string `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - `i`: This variable will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `s`: The string `s` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `us`: The set `us` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `win`: The set `win` remains unchanged within the loop unless certain conditions are met.
   - `ans`: The list `ans` may be updated if `i` is added to `win`.
   - `ps`: The variable `ps` remains unchanged within the loop.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the only variables that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are `i` and `ps`.

- Since `i` is the first character of the string `s` at the start of each iteration, it will be the next character in the string `s`.
- `ps` remains unchanged within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`i` is the second character of the string `s`, `s` is the original string, `us` is unchanged, `win` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `ps` is unchanged**.
