Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and the value of t is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    f = 1
    num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
    for j in range(n - 1):
        if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
            f = 0
            break
    if n == 1 or f == 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    onum = num.copy()
    onum.reverse()
    cn = 1
    ck = 1
    f = 1
    symb1 = num[0]
    symb2 = onum[0]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if num[i] == num[i + 1]:
            cn += 1
        else:
            break
    for ii in range(n - 1):
        if onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]:
            ck += 1
        else:
            break
    if symb1 == symb2:
        cn += ck
    print(n - max(cn, ck))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `onum`, and `cn` is increased by `ck`. This means that if `symb1` equals `symb2`, `ck` is added to `cn`, and if they do not equal, the condition for exiting the loop is met without changing `cn`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ii` is 4, `n` is 4, and `ck` is either 0 or 1, with `cn` being equal to `ck`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is `n`, `ck` is 7 or 8, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
