Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for r in range(t)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `r` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `ii` is 4
   - `n` is 4
   - `ck` is either 0 or 1
   - `cn` is equal to `ck`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `r < t`. Since `r` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue until `r` reaches `t`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `r` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Calculate the new values**:
   - If `r` was 4 (the end of the previous iteration), then for the next iteration, `r` will be 5.
   - `t` remains the same as it did not change during the previous iteration.

6. **Check the conditions**:
   - `ii` and `n` remain unchanged and still hold the values 4 and 4 respectively.
   - `ck` and `cn` remain either 0 or 1 and are still equal.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ii` is 4, `n` is 4, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, and `t` is the same as before.**
