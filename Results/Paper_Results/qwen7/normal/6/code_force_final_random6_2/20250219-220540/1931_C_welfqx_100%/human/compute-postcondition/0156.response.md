Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element into an integer, storing the result in the list `num`. The values of `ii`, `n`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
