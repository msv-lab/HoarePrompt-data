Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, and either `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the first character of `onum`.**

The code assigns the first character of the reversed string `onum` to the variable `symb2`. Since `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb2` becomes the first character of `onum`. All other variables remain unchanged.
