Output State: **`ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num`, `cn` is increased by `ck`, `r` is `t`, `f` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits it into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `num`. The other variables (`ii`, `ck`, `cn`, `r`, `f`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `num` is updated to reflect the list of integers entered by the user.
