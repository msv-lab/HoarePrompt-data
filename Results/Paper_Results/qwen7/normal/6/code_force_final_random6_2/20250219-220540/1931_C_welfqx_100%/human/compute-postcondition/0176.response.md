Output State: `ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `num`, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, and the loop has executed such that for every pair of consecutive elements in the list `num`, `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`. If any pair of consecutive elements is not equal, the loop breaks and `f` remains 0.
