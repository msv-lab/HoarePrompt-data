Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we acknowledge breaking out of such a block. All other variables retain their initial states.
