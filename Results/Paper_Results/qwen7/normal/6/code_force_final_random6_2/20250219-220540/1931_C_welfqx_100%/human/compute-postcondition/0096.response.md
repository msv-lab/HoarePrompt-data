Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, and `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in `num` are different.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `j` goes from `n-2` to 0), the variable `f` will be 0 if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in the list `num` that are different. Otherwise, if all consecutive elements are the same, `f` will remain 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is assumed to be greater than 1 since the loop runs as long as `n > 1`.
