Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num`, `cn` is increased by `ck`, `r` is `t`, `f` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. If the element at index `j` in `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` in `num`, then `f` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the elements are equal, no changes are made to `f` and the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, no changes are made to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, then `f` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, no changes are made to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
