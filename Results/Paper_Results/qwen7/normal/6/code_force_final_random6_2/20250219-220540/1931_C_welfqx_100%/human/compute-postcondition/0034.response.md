Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1 (since `range(n - 1)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n - 2`). This means `n` must be at least 2.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 2`.

3. **Adjust the Given States**:
   - We know that `n` must be at least 1, but for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` will start from 0.

4. **List the Adjusted States**:
   - `total` is not directly related to the loop execution and can remain as is.
   - `ck`, `t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `cn`, `symb1`, and `symb2` are not directly related to the loop execution and can remain as is.

Therefore, the states that need adjustment are `n` and `i`.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
