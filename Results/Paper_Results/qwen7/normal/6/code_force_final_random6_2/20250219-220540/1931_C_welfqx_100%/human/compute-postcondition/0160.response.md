Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, the current value of `j` is 0, and the current value of `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `f` from 1 to 0. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
