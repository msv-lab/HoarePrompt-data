Postcondition: **`ii` is 6, `ck` is 4 or 3, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1. If `onum[ii]` equals `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ii` becomes 6, `ck` changes to 4 or 3, `cn` remains 1 or 2, and `r` and `f` stay as 5 and 1 respectively. Otherwise, `ii` stays at 6, `ck` remains 3 or 2, `cn` stays 1 or 2, and `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, and `symb2` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
