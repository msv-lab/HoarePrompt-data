Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(n - 1)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State of `j` and `n`**:
   - From the given information, at the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, and if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - Since `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we infer that `j` is the current value of `ii` minus 1 (since `ii` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be 3).

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The condition `range(n - 1)` means `j` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `j` will be incremented from 3 to 4.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `ck`, `cn`, `r`, and `f` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, `j` is 4**
