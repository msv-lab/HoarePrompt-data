Output State: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common divisor of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the gcd of its current value and each subsequent element in `numbers`.
