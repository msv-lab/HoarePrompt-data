Output State: `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `l` and increase `st` as long as `l` is less than `r` and the adjacent elements `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]` are equal. Given that the loop executed at least 3 times, it means there were at least 3 consecutive identical elements at the start of the list. This pattern would continue until `l` eventually reaches `r` (or `r-1` if `n` is even), meaning all consecutive duplicates have been skipped. At this point, `l` will be equal to `r`, and `st` will be incremented by `(n - 1) - 1 = n - 3` if the first element was equal to the last element, or simply `n - 3` if they were not.
