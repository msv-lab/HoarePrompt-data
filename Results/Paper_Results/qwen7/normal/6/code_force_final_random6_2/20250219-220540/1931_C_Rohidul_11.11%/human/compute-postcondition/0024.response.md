Output State: **`l` is less than `r - 1`, `r` is decreased by 1, and `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` is now `r - 1`. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, `l` is still less than `r - 1`, and `a[r]` is still equal to `a[r - 1]`.
