Output State: **`l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are all equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is either `n - 3` or `0` depending on whether the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to a list. The values of `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` remain unchanged as they were initialized to `n - 1`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as well since the condition checking the first and last elements of `a` hasn't been evaluated yet. The variable `a` now holds the list of integers entered by the user.
