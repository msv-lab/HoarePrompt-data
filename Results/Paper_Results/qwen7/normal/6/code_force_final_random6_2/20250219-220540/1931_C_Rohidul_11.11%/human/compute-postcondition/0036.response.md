Output State: **`l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l` calculates the difference between `r` and `l`. Given that `l` is equal to `r`, the value of `ans` will be `r - l = 0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
