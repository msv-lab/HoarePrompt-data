Output State: **l is 0, r is n - 1, st is n - 1, end is 3 * (number of iterations), and ans is either 0 or -n depending on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `l` will eventually reach 0, and `r` will reach `n - 1` because the loop continues to increment `l` and decrement `r` until they meet. The variable `st` will be equal to `n - 1` because it increments by 1 for each consecutive equal element at the start of the list, and `end` will be incremented by 3 for each iteration of the loop, making it `3 * (number of iterations)`. 

The value of `ans` will depend on the final values of `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end`, as well as the comparison of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`. Given that `l` and `r` will span the entire list, if `a[0] == a[-1]` and `st` is greater than 0, `ans` will be `r - l - 1`, which is `0` since `r - l` would be `1`. If `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` and `end` are both 0, `ans` will be `len(a) - 1`, which is `n - 1`. In all other cases, `ans` will be `-n` due to the condition `ans = r - l` when `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st` and `end` are non-zero.
