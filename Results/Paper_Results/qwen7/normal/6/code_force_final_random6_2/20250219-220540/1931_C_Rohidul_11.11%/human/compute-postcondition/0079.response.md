Postcondition: `l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `2 * n - 2`, `ans` is 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.

This means that regardless of whether the condition `st == 0 and end == 0` is true or false, the values of `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` remain unchanged as `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n - 1`, and `2 * n - 2` respectively, and `ans` is set to 0. Additionally, the condition that the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` is preserved.
