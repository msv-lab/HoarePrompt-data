Output State: **`l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `2 * n - 2`**.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `l` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1, while `st` remains unchanged and `end` is incremented by 1. Since the loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, and given that the loop has executed 3 times with `l` now at `n - 2`, it means `l` will eventually reach `n - 1` when `r` also reaches `n - 1`. During these iterations, `end` is incremented by 1 for each loop execution, so after `n - 1` total iterations (since `l` starts at `n - 1 - 3` and needs to reach `n - 1`), `end` will be `2 * n - 2`. `st` remains `n - 1` because it only tracks the number of times the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` was met, which does not change based on the loop's termination condition.
