Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string using `split()`, and then converts those strings back to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but it is mentioned that `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, which is still a valid condition.
