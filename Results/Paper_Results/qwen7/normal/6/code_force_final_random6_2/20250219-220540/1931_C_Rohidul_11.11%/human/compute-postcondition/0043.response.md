Output State: **`l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 3, `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if `a[0] == a[-1]` and `st` is greater than 0, or 0 otherwise, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, `ans`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
