Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```
This means the loop will continue as long as two conditions are met:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `l` is `n - 2`
- `r` is `n - 4`
- `st` is `n - 3`
- `end` has been increased by 1 (though this state is not part of the loop head)

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition 1: `r > l`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is `n - 4` and `l` is `n - 2`.
   - Clearly, `r > l` is false because `(n - 4) <= (n - 2)`.

2. **Condition 2: `a[r] == a[r - 1]`**
   - The value of `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are not provided, but since the loop continues as long as both conditions are true, we need to ensure that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true for the next iteration.

### Adjusting the States
To make the loop execute one more time, we need to ensure both conditions are met:
1. `r > l` should be true.
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]` should hold true.

Since `r` is currently `n - 4` and `l` is `n - 2`, we need to decrease `r` or increase `l` to satisfy `r > l`. However, since `r` is already smaller than `l`, we cannot change `r` or `l` directly to make `r > l` true.

Therefore, the only way to make the loop execute one more time is to ensure that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` holds true for the current values of `r` and `r - 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is increased by 1 and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must hold true**
