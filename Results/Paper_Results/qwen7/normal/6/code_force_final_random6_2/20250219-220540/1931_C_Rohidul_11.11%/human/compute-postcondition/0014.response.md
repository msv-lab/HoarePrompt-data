Output State: **`l` is 4, `r` must be greater than 3, `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`, `st` is 1.**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Since `st` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. After executing `st += 1`, `st` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
