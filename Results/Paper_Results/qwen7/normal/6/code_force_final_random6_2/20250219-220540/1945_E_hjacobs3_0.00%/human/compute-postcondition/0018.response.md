Output State: **`mid` is equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2, `r` is `mid` - 1, `l` must be less than or equal to `mid - 1` or `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged, and the condition involving `l` and `r` is updated accordingly.
