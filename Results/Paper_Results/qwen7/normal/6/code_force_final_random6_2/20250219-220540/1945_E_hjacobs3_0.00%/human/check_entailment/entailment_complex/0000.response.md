Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by performing a binary search on a permutation array to find the position of a specific number `x`. However, the implementation of the binary search and the logic for determining the necessary swaps are incorrect.

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the provided code is flawed. The variables `l` and `r` are initialized incorrectly (`l = 0` and `r = n - 1`). They should be initialized to `1` and `n + 1` respectively, as per the problem statement. This initialization ensures that the binary search correctly narrows down the range to find the position of `x`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The logic for determining the necessary swaps is also incorrect. The provided code simply checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array and returns the indices without ensuring that the array is rearranged correctly. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the array, which should result in a return value of `0`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
