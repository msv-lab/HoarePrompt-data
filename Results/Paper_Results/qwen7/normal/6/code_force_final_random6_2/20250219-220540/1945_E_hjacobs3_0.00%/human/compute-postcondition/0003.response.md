Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the range defined by `l` and `r`. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the expression `(l + r) // 2` simplifies to `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`. This value is assigned to `mid`. The values of `array`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
