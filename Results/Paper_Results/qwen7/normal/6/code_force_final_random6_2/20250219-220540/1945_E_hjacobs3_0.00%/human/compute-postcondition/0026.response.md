Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in the `array` list converted to a string, and the second string is also the index of `find` in the `array` list converted to a string.**

This means the program returns the position of the element `find` in the list `array` as both elements in a list, with each position incremented by 1 (since list indices are 0-based).
