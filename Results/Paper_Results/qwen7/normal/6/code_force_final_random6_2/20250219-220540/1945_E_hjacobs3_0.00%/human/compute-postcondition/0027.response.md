Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` and `r` define a range within the original array where no element is equal to or greater than `find` (if `l > r`), or `l` and `r` point to the boundaries of the subarray where `find` could potentially reside (if `l <= r`); `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value during the loop's execution. Moreover, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.**
