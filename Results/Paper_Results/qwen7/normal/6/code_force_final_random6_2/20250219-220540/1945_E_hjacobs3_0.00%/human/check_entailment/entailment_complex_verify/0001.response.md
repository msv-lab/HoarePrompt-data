### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the `l`-th position before performing a binary search.
   - The binary search algorithm is used to find the position of `x` in the permutation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the permutation and the target value `x`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to determine if any swaps are needed and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array to find the index where `x` should be placed.
   - It checks if the current middle element (`array[mid]`) is greater than or equal to `x` and adjusts the search range accordingly.
   - After the binary search, it checks if the target `x` is already at the correct position (`array.index(find)`). If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.

4. **Issues with the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually perform the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct position.
   - The function only prints 1 if a swap is needed but does not provide the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The function does not handle the case where the target `x` is not present in the array, which would require 2 swaps.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the positions of `x` and the smallest and largest elements in the array.
   - We need to consider different scenarios for placing `x` at the correct position using at most 2 swaps.
   - Specifically, we need to check if `x` is already in the correct position, or if it needs to be swapped with another element to be in the correct position.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: The array is a permutation of length `n`, and `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x <= n`.
- **Binary Search Execution**: The binary search is performed to find the position where `x` should be placed.
- **Check Position**: After the binary search, the function checks if `x` is already at the correct position. If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
- **Swapping Logic**: The function does not actually perform the swaps; it only prints the indices. This means the actual array is not modified, and the binary search will still fail to find `x` in the correct position.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, the function should:
1. Perform the binary search to find the position where `x` should be placed.
2. Check if `x` is already at the correct position.
3. If not, identify the correct positions to swap to place `x` in the correct position using at most 2 swaps.
4. Print the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as required. It only prints the indices without actually performing the swaps, leading to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
