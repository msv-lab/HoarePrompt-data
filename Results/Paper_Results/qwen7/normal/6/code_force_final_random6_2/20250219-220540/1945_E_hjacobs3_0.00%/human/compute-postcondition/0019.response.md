Output State: **`mid` is equal to (`l` + `r`) // 2, `l` is `mid + 1`, or `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The other conditions and relationships involving `mid`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, `mid` is still defined as (`l` + `r`) // 2, and the condition that `mid + 1` must be less than or equal to `r` remains valid.
