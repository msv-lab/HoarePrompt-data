Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the case where the element to be found (`x`) is not present in the permutation. According to the problem description, the binary search algorithm should be applied to a sorted version of the permutation, and the elements at the specified indices should be swapped no more than 2 times to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

In the given implementation, the function `func_1` performs a binary search but does not check if `x` is actually present in the permutation. If `x` is not found, the function returns without performing any swaps, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  6 3
  1 2 4 5 6 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1
  5 6
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```

In this case, the element `3` is present in the permutation, but the program does not perform any swaps and incorrectly returns `0`. The correct output should indicate that one swap is needed to place `3` at the correct position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
