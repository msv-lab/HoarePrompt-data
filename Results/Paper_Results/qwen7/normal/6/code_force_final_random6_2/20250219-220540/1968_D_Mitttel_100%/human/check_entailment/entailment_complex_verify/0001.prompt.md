You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array a, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, and k is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is the maximum value encountered during all iterations of the loop, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0 (since it is decremented until it reaches 0), `vis[s]` is 1 if `s` was visited during any iteration, otherwise it remains 0, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` after each iteration until the condition `not vis[s] and k > 0` no longer holds.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, `mx` will hold the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` seen during any iteration, `cur` will be the total sum of `a[s]` added across all iterations, `k` will be 0 as it gets decremented to 0, `vis[s]` will be marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` will point to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during all iterations of the loop, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0, `vis[s]` is marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` points to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a permutation `p`, a list of starting positions `s`, and a non-negative integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` based on the permutation `p` starting from the positions specified in `s`. During each iteration, it calculates the value of `cur + k * a[s]` and updates the maximum value found (`mx`). It also keeps track of visited positions in the `vis` list. After all iterations, it returns the maximum value found (`mx`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` which represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the indices of the permutation and array by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - It iteratively updates the score and position until `k` turns are completed or a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited).
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the starting position `s`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores obtained from `func_1` for both players.
   - Based on the comparison, it prints whether Bodya, Sasha, or there is a draw.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game for one player. It ensures that the player maximizes their score by staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The use of `vis` to detect cycles is crucial to prevent infinite loops and ensure the simulation runs for exactly `k` turns.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly compares the scores obtained from `func_1` for both players and determines the winner or if it's a draw.
   - The conditions for printing "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. All steps are logically sound and handle the problem as described.
