Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers from 1 to n `p`, a list of integers `s` representing the starting positions, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the duration of the game. It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during all iterations of the loop, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0, `vis[s]` is marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` points to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.**
