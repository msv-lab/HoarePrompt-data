Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` which represent the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the indices of the permutation and array by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - It iteratively updates the score and position until `k` turns are completed or a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is revisited).
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the starting position `s`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores obtained from `func_1` for both players.
   - Based on the comparison, it prints whether Bodya, Sasha, or there is a draw.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game for one player. It ensures that the player maximizes their score by staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation.
   - The use of `vis` to detect cycles is crucial to prevent infinite loops and ensure the simulation runs for exactly `k` turns.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly compares the scores obtained from `func_1` for both players and determines the winner or if it's a draw.
   - The conditions for printing "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game. All steps are logically sound and handle the problem as described.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
