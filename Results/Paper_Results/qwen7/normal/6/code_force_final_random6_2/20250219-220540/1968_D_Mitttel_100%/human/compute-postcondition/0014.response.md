Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1 (now `k-1`), `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= 1` decreases the value of `k` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes `k` being reduced by 1.
