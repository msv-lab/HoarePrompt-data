Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `vis[s]` is 1, `s` is updated to `p[s]`**.

Explanation: The code sets `vis[s]` to 1, indicating that the state `s` has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
