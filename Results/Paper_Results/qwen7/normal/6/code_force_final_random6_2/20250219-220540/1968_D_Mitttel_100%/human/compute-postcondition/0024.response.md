Output State: **The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during all iterations of the loop, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` accumulated during all iterations, `k` is 0, `vis[s]` is marked as 1 for any `s` that was visited, and `s` points to its final value after the last iteration where the loop condition was still met.**
