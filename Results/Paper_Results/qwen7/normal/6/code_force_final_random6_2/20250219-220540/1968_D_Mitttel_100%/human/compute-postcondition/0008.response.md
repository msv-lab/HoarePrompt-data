Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur` + `k` * `a[s]`, `cur` is `cur` + `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `vis[s]` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `k` after decrementing is not specified in the initial state. The other variables (`mx`, `cur`, `a[s]`, and `vis[s]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
