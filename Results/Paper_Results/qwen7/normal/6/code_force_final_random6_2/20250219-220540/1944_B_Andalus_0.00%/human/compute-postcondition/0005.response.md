Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code `rgt = lst[n:]` assigns to `rgt` a slice of the list `lst` starting from index `n` to the end of the list. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remain unchanged. The list `lft` also remains unchanged. The new list `rgt` contains all elements of `lst` from index `n` to the last element.
