Output State: **`sz` is 0, `k` is defined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `sz` or `k`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since the initial state specifies that `sz` is 0, `k` is defined, and `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, these conditions remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
