Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `elem`, `sng`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is 2.
   - `rdb` remains empty.
   - `sng` contains at least one element.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`. Each iteration processes one element from `sng`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is processed in each iteration, it will be removed or altered in some way (though the problem does not specify what happens to `elem` inside the loop, we assume it is consumed or moved out of `sng`).
   - `sng` will lose at least one element since the loop processes one element per iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `sz` remains unchanged because the size of `sng` is the only relevant size here, and it will still contain at least one element (since it had at least one before and now loses one).
   - `rdb` remains empty as no elements are added to it in the loop head.
   - `sng` will now contain at least one fewer element than before.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration would be:

State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` remains empty, and `sng` contains at least one fewer element than before**.
