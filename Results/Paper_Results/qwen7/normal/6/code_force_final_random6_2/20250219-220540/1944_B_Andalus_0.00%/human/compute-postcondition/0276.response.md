Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 3
- `k` is 3
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or iteration.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will execute within this context. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since no other information about `elem` is provided, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, the output will include `elem` twice, separated by a space, but without a newline character due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **elem elem**
