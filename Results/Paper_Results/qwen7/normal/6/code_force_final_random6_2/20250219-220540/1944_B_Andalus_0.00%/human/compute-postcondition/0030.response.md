Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i = 4`.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3**
