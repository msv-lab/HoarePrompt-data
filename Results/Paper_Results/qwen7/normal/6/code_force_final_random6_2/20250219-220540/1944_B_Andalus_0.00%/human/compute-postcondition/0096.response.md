Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 2`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Initially, `sz` was equal to `k + 1`. After executing the code, `sz` becomes `k + 2`. All other variables (`ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `elem`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
