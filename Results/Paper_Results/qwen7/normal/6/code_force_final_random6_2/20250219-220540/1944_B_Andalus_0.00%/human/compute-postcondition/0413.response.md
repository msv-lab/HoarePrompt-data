Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 3, and `sng` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1. Since `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k` + 2, after incrementing by 1, `sz` is now greater than or equal to `k` + 3. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same as long as `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `sng` remains unchanged and still contains at least one element.
