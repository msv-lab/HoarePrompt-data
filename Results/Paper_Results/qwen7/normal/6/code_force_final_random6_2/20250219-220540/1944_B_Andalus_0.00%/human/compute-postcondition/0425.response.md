Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- The value of `sz` ensures that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

However, the code snippet only references `elem`, but does not define what `elem` is. Given the information, `elem` could be any element from `rdb`, but since no specific value or formula for `elem` is provided, we cannot determine its exact value. 

Therefore, the output will include `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **elem elem**
