Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` is the total length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end (which is an empty list in this case), `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing the last element of `rgt` (if there are any elements in `rgt`), `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1` (which is the entire list `lst` since `n` is the total length of `lst`).
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, and if `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the original state of `ldb` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before, `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`, and `sz` is incremented by 2 if the condition `k - sz >= 2` is true. If the condition `sz >= k` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition `k - sz >= 2` is false, `sz` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ldb` contains at least one element, `elem` is the next element to be processed from `ldb`, `sz` is increased by 2, and if `sz >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `sz >= k` is not met, no changes are made to the state of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
