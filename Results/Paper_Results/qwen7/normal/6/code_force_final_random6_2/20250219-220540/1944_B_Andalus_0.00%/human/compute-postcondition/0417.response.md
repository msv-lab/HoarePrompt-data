Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the iterable `rdb`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**: We know that `sz` (which might be related to the size of `rdb`) is 0. However, `rdb` itself is not explicitly mentioned as having a specific state.
3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. If `rdb` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given this information, we need to adjust the state of `rdb` to ensure the loop can execute. Since `sz` is 0, it implies that `rdb` is likely an empty iterable. To make the loop execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `rdb` must contain at least one element.

**State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` must contain at least one element**
