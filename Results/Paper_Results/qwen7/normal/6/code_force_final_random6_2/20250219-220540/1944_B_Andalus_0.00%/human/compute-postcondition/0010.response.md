Output State: **`rgt` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
