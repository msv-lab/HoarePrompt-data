Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sz` is 2 and `k` is defined but its exact value is not specified. The print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the value of `elem`.

However, since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will describe it as `elem`, which is the variable whose value is being printed.

Output: **elem**
