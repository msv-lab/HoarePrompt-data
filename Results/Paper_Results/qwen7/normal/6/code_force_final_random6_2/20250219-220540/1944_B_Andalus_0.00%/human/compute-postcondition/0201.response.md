Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then the value of `rdb[-1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to the value of `rgt[0]`.

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`, which is `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain at least 2 (since it was at least 2 at the end of the previous iteration).

4. **Check the Condition Involving `rgt`**:
   - The condition `if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]` needs to be considered. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1, so we need to check if `rgt[1] == rgt[0]`.
   - If this condition holds true, then `rdb[-1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `rgt[0]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - The condition involving `rgt` should still hold true for `i = 2` (i.e., `rgt[2] == rgt[1]`), and if it does, `rdb[-1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `rgt[0]`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and if `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then the value of `rdb[-1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to the value of `rgt[0]`.**
