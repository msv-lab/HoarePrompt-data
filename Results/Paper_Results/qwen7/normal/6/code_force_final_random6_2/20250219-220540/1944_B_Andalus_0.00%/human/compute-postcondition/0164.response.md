Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `lft` is a list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index n.**

The code `rdb = []` simply assigns an empty list to the variable `rdb`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `ldb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
