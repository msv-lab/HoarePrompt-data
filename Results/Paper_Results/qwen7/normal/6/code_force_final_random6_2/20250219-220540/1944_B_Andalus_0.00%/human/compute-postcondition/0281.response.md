Output State: **`sz` is either 3 or 5, `k` is 3, and `rdb` is not empty and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional. The initial states of `sz`, `k`, and `rdb` remain unchanged.
