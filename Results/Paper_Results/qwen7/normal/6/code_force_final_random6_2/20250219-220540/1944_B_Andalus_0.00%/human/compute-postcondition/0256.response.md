Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is explicitly given as 2.
- `k` is defined but its value is not specified.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Given that `sz` is 2, and the condition to break out of the loop or if statement is `if sz >= k`, this means that if `k` is less than or equal to 2, the loop or if statement would break. However, since `k` is not specified, we cannot determine if the loop or if statement would break or not. 

The variable `elem` is not defined in the initial state, so it could be any value. Since no specific value is provided for `elem`, we cannot determine its exact value.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `elem`, which is not specified in the initial state.

Output: **elem (where elem is an undefined value)**
