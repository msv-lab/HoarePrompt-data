Output State: `sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` is the final value it reaches after all iterations, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` contains the last element added to it during the loop's execution, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1`, and `i` is the final value it reaches after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `sz` and `k` remain unchanged at 10 and 3 respectively. The list `sng` contains unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to the final index `n-1`. The variable `n` will be the highest index value that was processed within the loop. The list `rgt` contains the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, and it remains sorted. The list `ldb` remains empty. The list `rdb` will contain the last element that met the condition `rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]` during the loop's execution. The list `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to the final index `n-1`, and `i` will be the final value it reached, which is `n`.
