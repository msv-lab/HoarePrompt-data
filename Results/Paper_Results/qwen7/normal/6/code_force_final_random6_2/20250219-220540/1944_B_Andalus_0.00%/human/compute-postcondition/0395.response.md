Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` which iterates over the list `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**:
   - `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`.
   - `n` is the total length of `lst`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `sng` must contain at least one element. If `sng` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `sng` is a list that contains elements from `lft` up to index `n-1`, and `n` is the total length of `lst`, `sng` will always contain elements as long as `lft` has elements up to index `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the key state to adjust is ensuring that `sng` is not empty.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `sng` is not empty for the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`sng` must contain at least one element**
