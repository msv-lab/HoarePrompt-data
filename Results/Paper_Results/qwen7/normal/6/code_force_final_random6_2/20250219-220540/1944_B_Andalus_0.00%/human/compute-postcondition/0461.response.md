Output State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` remains empty, and `sng` contains at least one fewer element than before and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `sz`, `rdb`, or `sng`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
