Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for elem in sng:` statement. This means the loop is iterating over each element in the `sng` list.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ldb` is empty.
   - `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element.
   - `sz` is equal to `k + 2`.
   - `sng` must contain at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

3. **Understand what happens during one iteration of the loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `sng`.
   - For the first iteration, `elem` is set to the first element of `sng`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `elem` will be set to the second element of `sng`.
   - Since `sng` must contain at least one element, it will still contain at least one element for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `ldb` remains empty.
   - `rdb` remains unchanged.
   - `sz` remains unchanged.
   - `sng` still contains at least one element (it will now contain the remaining elements after the first element).
   - `elem` will be the second element of `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 2`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the second element of `sng`.**
