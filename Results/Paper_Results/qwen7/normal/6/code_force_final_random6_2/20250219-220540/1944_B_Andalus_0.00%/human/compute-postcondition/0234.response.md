Based on the initial state provided, we know that `ldb` contains at least one element, but we do not have any specific information about the value of `elem`. Similarly, `k` and `sz` are not explicitly defined, and there is no direct information about their values. The only thing we can infer is that `k - sz` remains unchanged, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

Given this information, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem` since it is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `elem` printed twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function).

Output: **elem elem**
