Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved, which are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then the value of `rdb[-1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to the value of `rgt[0]`.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`, which means `i` should be incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain at least 2 (since it was already at least 2 and hasn't changed).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains at least 2.

5. **Consider the Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition involves `rgt[2]` and `rgt[1]`, but since these values haven't been modified in the loop body (as per the omission), they remain as they were.
   - The value of `rdb[-1]` will only change if `rgt[2]` equals `rgt[1]`, but this condition is not relevant for determining the next state of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2**
