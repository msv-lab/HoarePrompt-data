Output State: **`sz` is 6, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is `elem`.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, changing it from 5 to 6. The values of `k` and `sng` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `sz` and retains the original conditions for `k` and `sng`.
