Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element (excluding the one processed in the current iteration), `sz` is 7, and `sng` must contain at least two elements.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it 7. The other variables (`ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is not directly affected by this line of code, so it remains as per the initial postcondition.
