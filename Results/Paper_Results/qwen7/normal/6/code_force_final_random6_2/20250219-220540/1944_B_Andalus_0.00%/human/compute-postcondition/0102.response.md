Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 3`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the second element of `sng`.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` was initially equal to `k + 2`. After executing the line `sz += 1`, `sz` is incremented by 1, making its new value `k + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
