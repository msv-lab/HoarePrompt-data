Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than `1`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable), `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`**.

The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable), and given the initial conditions, the updated state includes `sng` containing the element `lft[i]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
