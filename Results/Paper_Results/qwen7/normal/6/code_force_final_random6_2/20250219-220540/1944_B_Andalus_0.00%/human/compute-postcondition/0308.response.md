Output State: **`sz` is 8, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the new `elem`.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The values of `k` and `sng` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement based on `sz` being greater than or equal to `k` is still valid, but since the code only increments `sz` and does not evaluate the condition, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
