Output State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and the value of `sz` is such that `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 4.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making `sz` equal to 2. The condition that `rdb` must contain at least one element remains unchanged. Additionally, since `sz` was originally such that `k - sz` was greater than or equal to 2, after incrementing `sz` by 2, the new condition is that `k - sz` must be greater than or equal to 4.
