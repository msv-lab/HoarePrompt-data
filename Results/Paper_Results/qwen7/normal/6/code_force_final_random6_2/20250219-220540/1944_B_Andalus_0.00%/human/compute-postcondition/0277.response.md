Output State: **`sz` is 5, `k` is 3.**

Explanation: The initial value of `sz` is 3. The code `sz += 2` increments `sz` by 2, resulting in `sz` becoming 5. The value of `k` remains unchanged at 3. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or iteration (if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`) is not relevant here since we are only asked to provide the updated values of the variables after executing the code.
