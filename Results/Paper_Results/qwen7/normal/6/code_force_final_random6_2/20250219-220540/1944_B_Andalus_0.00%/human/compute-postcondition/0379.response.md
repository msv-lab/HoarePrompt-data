Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before, `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the state of `ldb`, `elem`, and `sz` remains as described in the initial state.
