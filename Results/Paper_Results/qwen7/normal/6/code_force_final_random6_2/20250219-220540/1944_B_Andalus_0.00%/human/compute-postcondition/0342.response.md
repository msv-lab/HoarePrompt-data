Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]`, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, `i` is 4, `sng` is now a list with one additional element which is `lft[4]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is 4, `sng` now contains one more element, which is `lft[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
