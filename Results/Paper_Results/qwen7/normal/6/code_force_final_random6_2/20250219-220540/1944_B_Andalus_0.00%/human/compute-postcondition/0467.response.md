Output State: `sz` is 3, `rdb` remains empty, and `sng` is empty.

Explanation: Since the loop breaks when `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and given that the loop executes up to 3 times, `sz` will be 3. The variable `rdb` remains empty as no elements are added to it within the loop. For the loop to execute 3 times, `sng` must contain at least 3 elements initially, but after 3 iterations, all elements have been printed, so `sng` will be empty.
