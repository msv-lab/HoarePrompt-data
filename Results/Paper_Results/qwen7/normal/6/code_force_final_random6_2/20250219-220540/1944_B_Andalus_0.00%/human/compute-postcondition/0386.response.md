The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ldb`. For the loop to execute again, `ldb` must contain at least one fewer element than before. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before, `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`, and `sz` is incremented by 2 if the condition `k - sz >= 2` is true. 

To determine the new state, we need to consider the condition under which the loop continues. The loop will continue as long as `ldb` contains at least one element. Therefore, `ldb` must still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.

Given that `ldb` must contain at least one fewer element than before, and assuming it still contains at least one element, the next element will be processed in the next iteration.

State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `elem` is the next element to be processed from `ldb`, and `sz` is incremented by 2 if the condition `k - sz >= 2` is true.**
