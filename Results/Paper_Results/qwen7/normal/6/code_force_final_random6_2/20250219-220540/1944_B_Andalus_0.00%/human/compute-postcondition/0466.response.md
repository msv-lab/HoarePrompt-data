Output State: `sz` is equal to the length of `sng`, `rdb` remains empty, and `sng` is fully iterated over, with the loop breaking once `sz` reaches the length of `sng`.

This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `sz` (which starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than the length of `sng`. Once `sz` equals the length of `sng`, the condition `sz >= k` (where `k` is implicitly the length of `sng`) will be true, causing the loop to break. At this point, `sz` will be equal to the length of `sng`, indicating that every element in `sng` has been processed.
