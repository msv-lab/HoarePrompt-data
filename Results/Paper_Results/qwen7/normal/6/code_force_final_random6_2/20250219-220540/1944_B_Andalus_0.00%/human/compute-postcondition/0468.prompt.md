Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 12, `sng` contains at least 1 element.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `rdb` will be empty because it loses at least one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. The value of `sz` increases by 1 in each iteration as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `sz` reached 12. The loop breaks when `sz` becomes 12, meaning `k` must be at least 13 for the loop to run fully. Therefore, `ldb` remains empty as it was not involved in any operations within the loop. The condition `sng` must contain at least two elements initially ensures there are enough elements for the loop to iterate at least three times, but after the third iteration, it only needs to contain at least one element to satisfy the loop's termination condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `sz` is 9, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, and the first three elements in the list are the `elem`s printed during each iteration of the loop.

This means that the loop continues to execute as long as `sz` (which starts at 5 and increments by 1 each iteration) is less than `k` (which is 3). Since the loop breaks when `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`, and given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `sz` is 9. At this point, `sz` will be equal to 9, which is greater than or equal to `k`, causing the loop to break. Therefore, the loop will execute a total of 4 times (from `sz` = 5 to `sz` = 9), printing 4 elements from the list `sng`. The list `sng` must have at least 4 elements to allow the loop to complete its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `sz` is 3, `rdb` remains empty, and `sng` is empty.

Explanation: Since the loop breaks when `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, and given that the loop executes up to 3 times, `sz` will be 3. The variable `rdb` remains empty as no elements are added to it within the loop. For the loop to execute 3 times, `sng` must contain at least 3 elements initially, but after 3 iterations, all elements have been printed, so `sng` will be empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
