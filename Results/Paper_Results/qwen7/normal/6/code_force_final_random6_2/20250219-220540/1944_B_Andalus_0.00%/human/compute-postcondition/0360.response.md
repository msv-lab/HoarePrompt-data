Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]`, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1`. `rdb` now contains the element `rgt[i]`**.

In more detail, the code appends the element `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 4, `rdb` now includes the element from `rgt` at index 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
