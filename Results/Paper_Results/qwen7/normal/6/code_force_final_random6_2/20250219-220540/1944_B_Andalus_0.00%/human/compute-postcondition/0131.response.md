Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` contains at least one less element than before.
- `sz` is either 5 or 7.
- `sng` must contain at least two elements.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `elem` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given the conditions, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is some value that is determined within the context of the loops or if statements that the program is executing.

Output: **elem elem **
