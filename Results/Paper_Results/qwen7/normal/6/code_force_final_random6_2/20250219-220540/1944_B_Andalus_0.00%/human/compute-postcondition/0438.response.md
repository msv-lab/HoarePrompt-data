Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `rdb`, or `elem`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is inside. Since no such loop or if statement is specified in the code snippet, the variables retain their initial states, and the break statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
