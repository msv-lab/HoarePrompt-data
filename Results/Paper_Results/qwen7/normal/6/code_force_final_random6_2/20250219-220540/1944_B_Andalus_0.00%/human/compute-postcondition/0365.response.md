Output State: **`sz` is 0, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` is the total length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end (which is an empty list in this case), `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing the last element of `rgt` (if there are any elements in `rgt`), `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1` (which is the entire list `lst` since `n` is the total length of `lst`).**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is explicitly set to 0, which overrides its previous value of 10. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
