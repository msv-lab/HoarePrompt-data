Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` in the range `range(1, n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `range(1, n)`, `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - After `i` was 3, it will now be 4.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]`, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1`**.
