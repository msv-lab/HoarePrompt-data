Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[i]`, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1`, and `i` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `rgt` to the list `rdb`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `rdb` now contains the element `rgt[n]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
