Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 3, and `sng` must contain at least one element.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `sz` will be at least 3 units larger than `k`. Additionally, the list `sng` will still contain at least one element because the loop breaks when `sz` reaches `k` + 3 or more, but it does not remove any elements from `sng`. The other variables (`ldb`, `rdb`, `lft`, and `rgt`) remain in their initial or unchanged states as they are not modified within the loop.
