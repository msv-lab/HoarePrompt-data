Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rgt` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `lft[i]` is either equal to `lft[i - 1]` (when `i` is 1 and `ldb` is set to `[lft[0]]`) or not equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is `[lft[0], lft[3]]`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `sng` contains `lft[i]`. Otherwise, no change is made to `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, and if `lft[4]` equals `lft[3]`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[4]` does not equal `lft[5]`, the list `sng` will have the element `lft[4]` appended to it. If neither condition is met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
