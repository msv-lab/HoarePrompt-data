Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `lst`. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
