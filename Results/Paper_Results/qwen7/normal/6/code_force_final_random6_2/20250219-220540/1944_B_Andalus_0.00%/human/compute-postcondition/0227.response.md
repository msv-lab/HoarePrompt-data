Output State: **`ldb` must contain at least one element, `k - sz` remains unchanged, `sz` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. The conditions that `ldb` must contain at least one element and that `k - sz` remains unchanged from the previous state are still valid. If `sz` was previously greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement would have been broken out of, but since `sz` is only incremented by 2, this condition does not change.
