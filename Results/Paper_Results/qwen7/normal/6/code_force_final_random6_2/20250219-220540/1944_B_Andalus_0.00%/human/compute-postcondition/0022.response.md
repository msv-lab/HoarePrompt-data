Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `lft[i]` is either equal to `lft[i - 1]` (when `i` is 1 and `ldb` is set to `[lft[0]]`) or not equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.
