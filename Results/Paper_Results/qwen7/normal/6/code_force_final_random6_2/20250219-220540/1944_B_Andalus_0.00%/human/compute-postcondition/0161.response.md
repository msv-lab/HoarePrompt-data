Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `lft` is a list containing the first n elements of `lst`**.

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` slices the list `lst` from the beginning up to the `n`-th element (not including the `n`-th element) and assigns it to the variable `lft`. The other variables (`ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
