Postcondition: `sz` is 6, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the original `elem`. If the condition `sz >= k` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
