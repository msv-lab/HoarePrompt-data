Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `ldb` is `[lft[0], lft[3]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 3, `ldb` will now contain `lft[0]` (as per the precondition when `i` is 1) and `lft[3]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
