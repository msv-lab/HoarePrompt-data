Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 2.
- `sng` must contain at least one element.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it could be any value that is relevant within the context of the program. However, based on the given information, we know that `elem` must exist and be a valid value for printing.

Output: **elem**
