Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The original values of `sz`, `k`, `sng`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new list `lst` contains integers derived from the input string.
