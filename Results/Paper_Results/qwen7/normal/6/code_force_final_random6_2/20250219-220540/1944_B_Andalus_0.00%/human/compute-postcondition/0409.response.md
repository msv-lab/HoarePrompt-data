Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` + 2, and `sng` must contain at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `sz` or `sng`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
