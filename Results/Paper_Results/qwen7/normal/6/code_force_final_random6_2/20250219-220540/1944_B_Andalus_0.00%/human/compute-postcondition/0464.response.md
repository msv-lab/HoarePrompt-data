Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 2
- `rdb` remains empty
- `sng` contains at least one fewer element than before
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`. Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, implying that `elem` must have been assigned a value within that loop or if statement context.

Given the lack of explicit definition for `elem`, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` holds some value that was determined during the execution of the loop or if statement.

Output: **elem (where elem is the value determined during the execution of the loop or if statement)**
