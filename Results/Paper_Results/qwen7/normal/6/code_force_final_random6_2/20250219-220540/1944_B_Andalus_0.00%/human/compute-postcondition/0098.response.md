Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`. The variable `elem` takes each element from `sng` one by one.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ldb` is empty.
   - `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element.
   - `sz` is equal to `k + 2`.
   - `sng` must contain at least one element.
   - `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is the first element of `sng` and the loop is about to execute again, `elem` will be set to the next element in `sng`.
   - For the loop to continue, `sng` must still contain at least one element. After removing the first element (`elem`), `sng` should still have at least one element left.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `ldb` remains empty.
- `rdb` remains unchanged.
- `sz` remains unchanged.
- `sng` must now contain at least one element (since `elem` was the first element, `sng` must still have at least one element left).
- `elem` will be the second element of `sng`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 2`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the second element of `sng`.**
