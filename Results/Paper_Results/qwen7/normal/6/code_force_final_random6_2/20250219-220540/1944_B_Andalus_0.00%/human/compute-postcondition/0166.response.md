Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 13, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `lft` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (first n elements of `lst`), `rgt` is a list containing the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index n, `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `lft.sort()` sorts the list `lft` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. `lft` now contains the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted, while `rgt` remains unchanged and contains the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`.
