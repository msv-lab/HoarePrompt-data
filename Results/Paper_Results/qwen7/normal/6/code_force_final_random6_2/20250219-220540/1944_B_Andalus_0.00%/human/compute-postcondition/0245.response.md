Output State: **`sz` is 1 and `k` is defined.**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The variable `k` remains defined as it was in the initial state, and the condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement based on `sz` being greater than or equal to `k` is not specified to be checked again in this snippet. Therefore, the state of `k` remains unchanged.
