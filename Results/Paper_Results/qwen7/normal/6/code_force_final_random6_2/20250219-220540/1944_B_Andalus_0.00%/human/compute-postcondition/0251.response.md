Output State: **`sz` is 3 and `k` is defined.**

Explanation: The initial state has `sz` as 2 and `k` is defined. The code snippet increments `sz` by 1, making `sz` equal to 3. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement (`sz >= k`) is still true since `sz` is now 3 and `k` is defined, but the postcondition only mentions the updated value of `sz` and confirms that `k` is defined.
