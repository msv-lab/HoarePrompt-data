Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3, and if `lft[4]` equals `lft[3]`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[4]` does not equal `lft[5]`, the list `sng` will have the element `lft[4]` appended to it. If neither condition is met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
