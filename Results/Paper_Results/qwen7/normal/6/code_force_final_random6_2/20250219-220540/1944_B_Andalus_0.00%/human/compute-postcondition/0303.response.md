Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `elem`, `sng`, and implicitly `k` (since `elem` is being taken from `sng`).

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `sng`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is 7 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop, so it remains unchanged).
   - `k` is 3 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop, so it remains unchanged).
   - `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the original `elem`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `sng`, at the end of each iteration, `elem` will be set to the next element in the list `sng`.
   - After processing one element, `sng` will have one less element than before.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `elem` will be the next element in the list `sng`.
   - `sng` will be the remaining list after removing the first element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that `elem` is now the next element in `sng`, and `sng` is the list without its first element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sz` is 7, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the new `elem`**.
