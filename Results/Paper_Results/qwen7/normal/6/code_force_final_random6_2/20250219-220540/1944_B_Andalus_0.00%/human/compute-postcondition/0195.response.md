Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ldb` will contain all elements from `lft` that are equal to their preceding element in `lft`, and `sng` will contain all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to their preceding nor succeeding elements in `lft`, provided such elements exist within the bounds of the list.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ldb` will include every element from the `lft` list that is identical to the previous element in the same list, and `sng` will include every element from `lft` that does not match either its preceding or succeeding elements in the list, ensuring that all elements are processed according to the conditions specified in the loop.
