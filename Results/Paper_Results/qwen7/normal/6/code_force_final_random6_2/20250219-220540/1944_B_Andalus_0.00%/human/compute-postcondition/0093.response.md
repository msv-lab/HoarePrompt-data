Postcondition: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 1`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and `k - sz` must be at least 1, since the if condition `sz >= k` is always true and there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
