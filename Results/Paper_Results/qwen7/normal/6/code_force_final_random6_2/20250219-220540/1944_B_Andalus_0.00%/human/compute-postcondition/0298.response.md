Output State: **`sz` is 6, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, and the first element in the list is the original `elem`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `sz`, `k`, or `sng`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
