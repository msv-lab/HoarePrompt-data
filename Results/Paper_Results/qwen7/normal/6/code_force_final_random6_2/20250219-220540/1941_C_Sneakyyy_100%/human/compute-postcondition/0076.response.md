Postcondition: **`a` is a new input string with a length greater than 3, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 1 and having a length of 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 4 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 2 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.**
