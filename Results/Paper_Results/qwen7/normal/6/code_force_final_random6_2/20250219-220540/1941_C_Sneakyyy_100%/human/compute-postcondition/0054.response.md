To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `a` minus 2.

2. **Current State**:
   - `a` is the new input string.
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
   - `i` is 6 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 4 otherwise.
   - `s` is `a[3:6]`.

3. **Determine the Value of `i`**:
   - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 6.
   - Otherwise, `i` is 4.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

5. **Possible Values of `i`**:
   - If `i` is 6, the condition `i < len(a) - 2` will only hold true if `len(a) - 2 > 6`, which simplifies to `len(a) > 8`.
   - If `i` is 4, the condition `i < len(a) - 2` will always hold true because `4 < len(a) - 2` is always true as long as `len(a) > 6`.

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is either 4 or 6, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 6 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 4 otherwise, where `s` is `a[3:6]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6**.
