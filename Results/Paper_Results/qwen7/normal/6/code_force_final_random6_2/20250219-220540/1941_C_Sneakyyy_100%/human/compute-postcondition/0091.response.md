Output State: `a` is a new input string with a length greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (starting from index `i` and having a length of 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is `len(a)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be incremented until it is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`. This means `i` will be equal to `len(a)`. The variable `ans` will hold the total number of times a substring 'map' or 'pie' was found in the string `a`, starting from the beginning and checking every three characters until the second last character.
