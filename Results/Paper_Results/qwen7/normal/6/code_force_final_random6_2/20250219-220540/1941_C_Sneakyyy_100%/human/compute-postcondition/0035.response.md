Output State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s` is the new substring starting from the new value of `i`.**

The code initializes `ans` to 0, which does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, `i`, or `s`. It only updates `ans` to 0 and increments `i` by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
