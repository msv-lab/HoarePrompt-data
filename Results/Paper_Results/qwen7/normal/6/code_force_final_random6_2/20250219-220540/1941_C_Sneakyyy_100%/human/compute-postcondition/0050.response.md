`ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 0 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'. After incrementing, `ans` will be 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'. The values of `a`, `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 2 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', `i` is 6 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', and `i` is 4 otherwise.**
