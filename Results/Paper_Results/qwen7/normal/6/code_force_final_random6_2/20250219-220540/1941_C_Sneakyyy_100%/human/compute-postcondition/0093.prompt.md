Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with length n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `a` is the original string input by the user.
- `n` is the original input integer.
- `ans` is the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
- `i` is the final index value after the loop has completed its iterations, which will be `len(a) - 2` if the loop condition `i < len(a) - 2` is no longer satisfied.
- `s` is the last substring of `a` considered during the loop, starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, but it does not affect the final state of `ans`.

In summary, `ans` will hold the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears as a substring of length 3 in `a`, and `i` will be set to `len(a) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking early due to encountering a substring that is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have `a` as the new input string, `n` as the new input integer (unchanged), `ans` as the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` as the last index processed plus 3 (if the last valid substring was 'map' or 'pie'), or `i` as the last index processed plus 1 (if the last valid substring was neither 'map' nor 'pie'), and `s` as the last substring checked, which would be `a[i:i + 3]`. The value of `ans` will be the sum of all occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' found in the string `a`, and `i` will be the index right after the last valid substring or one less if no valid substrings were found.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the total number of times 'map' or 'pie' appears in the string `a`, `i` will be the position right after the last 'map' or 'pie' found or the length of the string if no such substrings are found, and `s` will be the last 3 characters checked in the string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is a new input string with a length greater than or equal to `n + 2`, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (starting from index `i` and having a length of 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is `len(a)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be incremented until it is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`. This means `i` will be equal to `len(a)`. The variable `ans` will hold the total number of times a substring 'map' or 'pie' was found in the string `a`, starting from the beginning and checking every three characters until the second last character.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
