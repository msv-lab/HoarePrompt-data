Output State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is the last index processed plus 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `ans`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
