### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`case`).

2. **Array Rearrangement:**
   - The array `a` is split into a list of integers.
   - The function `func_1` is called to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it proceeds to calculate the beauty.
   - The array `a` is sorted to get `b`.
   - The beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It increments `order` each time an element is greater than or equal to its successor.
   - If `order` is zero, it returns `True`, indicating the array is sorted.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary because the goal is to maximize the beauty, not to check if the array is sorted.
   - Sorting the array directly and calculating the beauty is sufficient.

2. **Incorrect Main Logic Flow:**
   - The program incorrectly prints `0` if `func_1` returns `True`, which is incorrect.
   - The program should always sort the array and calculate the beauty regardless of the initial order.

3. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly after sorting.
   - This ensures that the maximum possible beauty is achieved.

#### Corrected Version:

The original assessment suggests a corrected version where the array is always sorted before calculating the beauty. This is indeed the correct approach.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program needs to be corrected by removing the unnecessary `func_1` function and always sorting the array before calculating the beauty.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it unnecessarily checks if the array is sorted and prints `0` inappropriately. The correct approach is to always sort the array and calculate the beauty.
