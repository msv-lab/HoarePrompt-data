State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, and order is 0, `i` is 1, `num2` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `num2`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, num2):` will start with `i` being 1 and will continue as long as `i < num2`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `num2` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1).
4. The variable `order` is set to 0 and does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.
5. The list `a` is a list of integers but does not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 1 and `num2` must be greater than 1.
