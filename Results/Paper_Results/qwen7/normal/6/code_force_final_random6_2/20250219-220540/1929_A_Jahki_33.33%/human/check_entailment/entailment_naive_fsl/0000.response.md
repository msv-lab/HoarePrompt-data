Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and the main logic flow. 

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the maximum beauty. Instead, the program should focus on rearranging the array to maximize the beauty.

2. **Incorrect Main Logic Flow:**
   - The program uses `func_1` to determine whether the array needs to be rearranged. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `0`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should always attempt to rearrange the array to maximize the beauty.
   - Even if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the program should still sort it to ensure the maximum possible beauty.

3. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    # Sort the array to maximize the beauty
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is always sorted before calculating the beauty, thus maximizing the result according to the problem description.
