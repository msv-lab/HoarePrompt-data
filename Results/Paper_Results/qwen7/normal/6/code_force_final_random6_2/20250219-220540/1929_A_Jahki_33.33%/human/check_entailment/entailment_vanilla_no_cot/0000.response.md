Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function and does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`, indicating no rearrangement is needed. However, this function is not used correctly in the main logic of the program. The condition `if func_1(a, num2): print(0)` is unnecessary and incorrect because the main logic should always attempt to maximize the beauty regardless of whether the array is already sorted.

2. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach is correct but the function `func_1` is incorrectly influencing the result.

To fix the program, you should remove the `func_1` check and directly proceed with sorting the array and calculating the beauty. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
