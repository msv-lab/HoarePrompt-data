Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then compute the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This works because sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible elements, maximizing the positive differences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If it is, the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted.
   - If the array is sorted (`func_1` returns `True`), the beauty is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and computes the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for computing the beauty when the array is not sorted is correct.
   - The use of `func_1` to determine if the array is already sorted is also correct.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the requirements of the problem.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
