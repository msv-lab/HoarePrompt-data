Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `i` is 3, `order` is increased by 1.**

The code `order += 1` increments the value of `order` by 1. Since the initial value of `order` is not specified, we only know that it has been increased by 1. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
