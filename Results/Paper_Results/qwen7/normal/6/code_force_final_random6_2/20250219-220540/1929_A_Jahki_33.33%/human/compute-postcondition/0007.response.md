Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `num2`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `num2`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the array elements.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `num2` must be greater than 1.
   - If the element at index `i-1` (which is 0) is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` (which is 1), then the order is set to 1.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `num2` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `num2` must still be greater than 1.
   - The condition regarding the order is not directly affected by the loop increment but needs to be checked again in the next iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `i` is 2, `num2` must be greater than 1**.
