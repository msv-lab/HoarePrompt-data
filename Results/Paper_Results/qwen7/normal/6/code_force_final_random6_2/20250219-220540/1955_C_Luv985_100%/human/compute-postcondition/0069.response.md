Output State: **`a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n-3`, `ans` is 5, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n-2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
