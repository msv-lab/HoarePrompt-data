Output State: **`a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 4, `t` is `k % 2`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, `ans` was either 3 or 2. After incrementing, `ans` becomes 4. All other variables retain their initial conditions and values.
