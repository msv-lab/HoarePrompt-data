Output State: **`k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n-3`, `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was `n-2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
