Output State: **`a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[1]` is `a[1]`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `mi * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `mi` remains the same as it was the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation.
