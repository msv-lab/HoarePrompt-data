Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 1, `a[l]` is `a[1] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Given that `l` is 1, this means `a[1]` is decreased by `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
