Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is 1, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, and the condition `l == r` is now false. Additionally, `a[l]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was 0, so after executing this line, `l` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
