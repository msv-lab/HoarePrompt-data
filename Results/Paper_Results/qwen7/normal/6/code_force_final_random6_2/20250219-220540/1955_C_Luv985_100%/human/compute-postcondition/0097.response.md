Output State: **`ans` is 0, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. The other variables (`ans`, `T`, `r`, `mi`, and `a[l]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `a[r]` which is the original value of `a[r]` minus `mi`.
