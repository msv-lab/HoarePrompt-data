Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (`k - (min(a[l], a[r]) * 2)` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise unchanged), `l` is incremented by 1, `mi` is updated to the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` equals 0, then `r` is decremented by 1.
