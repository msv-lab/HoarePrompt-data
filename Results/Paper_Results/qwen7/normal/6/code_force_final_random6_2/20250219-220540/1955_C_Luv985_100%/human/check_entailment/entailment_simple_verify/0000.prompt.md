You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the reduction of durability and the conditions under which ships sink. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Durability Reduction**: The program attempts to reduce the durability of both the first and last ships simultaneously in each iteration, but this does not accurately reflect the Kraken's alternating pattern of attacking the first and last ships. The program should alternate between reducing the first and last ships' durability until one of them sinks.

2. **Handling Sunk Ships**: The program does not properly handle the scenario where a ship sinks and is no longer subject to further attacks. This is crucial because once a ship sinks, it should no longer be considered in the next attack cycle.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

However, let's walk through the expected behavior step-by-step:

1. **Initial Durabilities**: `[1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. **First Attack (First Ship)**: Durabilities become `[0, 2, 4, 3]` (Ship 1 sinks)
3. **Second Attack (Last Ship)**: Durabilities become `[0, 2, 4, 2]` (Ship 4 sinks)
4. **Third Attack (First Ship)**: Durabilities become `[0, 1, 4, 2]` (Ship 2 sinks)
5. **Fourth Attack (Last Ship)**: Durabilities become `[0, 1, 3, 2]` (No change, Ship 3 still has durability)
6. **Fifth Attack (First Ship)**: Durabilities become `[0, 0, 3, 2]` (Ship 2 already sank)

So, the correct number of ships that should sink is 3, not 2. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
