Postcondition: **`a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[1]` is `a[1]`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and `a[r]` is 0. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is set to 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is set to 1, regardless of the other conditions.
