Postcondition: **`T` is -1, `r` is either 1 or remains greater than `l`, `k` is adjusted according to the condition, `mi` is `min(a[l], 0)`, `ans` is either 3 or 4, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, and `a[l]` is updated by subtracting `mi` from its original value. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `r` is set to 1 and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, and `ans` is set to 4. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited.**
