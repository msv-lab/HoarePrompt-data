`l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `l` is either 1 or 0. After incrementing, `l` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * min(a[l], a[r])`, `l` is either 2 (if initially 1) or 1 (if initially 0), `mi` is `min(a[l] - mi, a[r] - mi)`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.**
