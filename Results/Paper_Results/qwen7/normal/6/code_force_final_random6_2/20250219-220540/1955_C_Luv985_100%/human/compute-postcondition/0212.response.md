Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * min(a[l], a[r])`, `l` is either 2 (if initially 1) or 1 (if initially 0), `mi` is `min(a[l] - mi, a[r] - mi)`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
