Output State: **`ans` is 0, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Since `mi` is defined as `min(a[l], a[r])`, after the subtraction, `a[l]` becomes `a[l] - mi`. The values of `ans`, `T`, `r`, and `mi` remain unchanged.
