Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `d`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `d` in the range from `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive), decrementing by `-1` each time.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `d` is -1.
   - `v` is either removed from `remaining_vertices` or remains unchanged.
   - `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`.

4. **Analyze the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `d` starts from `n-1` and decrements by `-1` each time, the next value of `d` would be `n-2` if the loop were to continue.
   - However, since `d` is currently `-1`, the loop condition `d in range(n - 1, -1, -1)` is no longer satisfied because `-1` is not in the range from `n-1` to `-1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `d` cannot be adjusted further as it has reached its lower limit and the loop will terminate.
   - The variables `v` and `u` remain unchanged as per the postconditions, and there is no indication that they should change based on the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop has already completed its iterations.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d` is -1, `v` is either removed from `remaining_vertices` or remains unchanged, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`**.
