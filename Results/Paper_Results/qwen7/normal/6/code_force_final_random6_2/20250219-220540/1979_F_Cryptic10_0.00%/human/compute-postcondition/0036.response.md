Output State: **`d` is 0, `v` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`**.

Given the initial state where `d` is 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, the line of code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is 0. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only state that `v` and `u` take on the values returned by `func_1(0)`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
