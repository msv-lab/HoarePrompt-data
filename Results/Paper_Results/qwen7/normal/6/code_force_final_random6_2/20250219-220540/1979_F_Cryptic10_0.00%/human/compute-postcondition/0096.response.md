Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)` and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `d`, `v`, or `u`, their values remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop or iteration continues.
