Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the value `v` appended to it.**

The code removes the variable `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Since `v` was already not in the set (as stated in the initial state), removing it does not change the set. The other variables remain unchanged: `d` stays as -1, `n` remains the same, and `path` still contains `v` appended to it.
