To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `remaining_vertices`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `remaining_vertices` is non-empty.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)`, and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`. Additionally, `v` is either in `remaining_vertices` or not, and based on this, `path` is updated accordingly.

### Adjusting the States:

- **`remaining_vertices`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must be non-empty. Since the loop condition is `while remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `remaining_vertices`. It must be non-empty.

### Final Answer:

State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` must be non-empty**.
