Output State: **Postcondition: `d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains all the vertices added during the loop iterations, and `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `d` will be -1 (since the loop decrements `d` from `n-1` to 0). The variable `v` will hold the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, and `u` will hold the second return value from `func_1(-1)`. If `v` was found in `remaining_vertices` during any iteration, it would have been appended to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` was never in `remaining_vertices`, `path` will retain whatever values were added during previous iterations, and `remaining_vertices` will remain unchanged.
