Postcondition: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
