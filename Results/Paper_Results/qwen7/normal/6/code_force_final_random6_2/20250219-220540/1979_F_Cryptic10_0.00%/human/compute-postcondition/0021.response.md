Output State: **`v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. No variables are updated or reassigned by this statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
