Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the return values of the function `func_1(d)` to `v` and `u`. Since `d` is `n-1`, `v` and `u` are now the second return values of `func_1(n-1)`. The initial values of `v` and `u` (which were the second return values of `func_1(-1)`) are no longer relevant. The value of `d` remains unchanged as it was already `n-1`.
