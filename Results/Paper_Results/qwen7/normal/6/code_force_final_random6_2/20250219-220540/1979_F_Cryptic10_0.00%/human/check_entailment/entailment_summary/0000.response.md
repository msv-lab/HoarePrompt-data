Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph.
2. The `func_1(d)` function is used to query the graph for vertices with a degree of at least `d`. It returns the vertex with the minimum degree that meets the criteria and a non-adjacent vertex to that vertex.
3. The `func_2(n)` function aims to construct a Hamiltonian path using the results from `func_1(d)` calls.
4. In `func_2(n)`, the algorithm iterates backward from `n-1` to `0` for `d` values, querying the graph. When a valid vertex `v` (with a degree of at least `d` and not already in the path) is found, it is added to the path and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
5. The provided code correctly implements the logic to find and add vertices to the path until all vertices are included.
6. The code ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once and that the path is constructed according to the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided implementation appears to correctly follow the problem's specifications and should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
