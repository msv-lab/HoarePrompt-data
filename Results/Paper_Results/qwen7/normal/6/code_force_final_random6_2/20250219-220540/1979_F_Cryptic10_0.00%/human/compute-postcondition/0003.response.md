State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to \(n\), `d` is \(n-1\)**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `d` is initialized in the loop head with the value `n - 1`.
2. The loop runs in reverse order from `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
3. For the loop to start executing, `d` must be initialized to `n - 1`.
4. The other variables (`n`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`) are not directly involved in the initialization or execution of the loop itself, but they remain as stated.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `d` as `n - 1`.
