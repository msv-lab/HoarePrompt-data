### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices, where exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph. The interaction involves querying the degree of vertices and identifying non-adjacent vertices to construct the path.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(d)`**: This function queries the graph for the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` and a non-adjacent vertex to that vertex. It returns the vertex and the non-adjacent vertex.
   - **`func_2(n)`**: This function uses `func_1(d)` to find a Hamiltonian path. It iterates over possible degrees from \( n-1 \) down to 0, adding vertices to the path when they are found to be non-adjacent to the previously added vertex.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Query Handling**: `func_1(d)` correctly handles the query and returns the expected values.
   - **Path Construction**: `func_2(n)` correctly constructs the path by ensuring that each added vertex is non-adjacent to the previous one and removing the vertex from the set of remaining vertices.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles the case where no vertex meets the criteria (returns `0 0`) by continuing to the next iteration.

4. **Interaction Protocol**:
   - The program adheres to the interaction protocol by making no more than \( n \) queries per test case and flushing the output buffer after each query.
   - The program correctly formats the output for the Hamiltonian path and flushes the output buffer after printing the path.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2(n)` is sound and follows the problem's requirements.
   - The use of `func_1(d)` to find suitable vertices ensures that the path is constructed correctly.

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
