Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, and the function `func_1` has been called with argument `-1,` updating the values of `v` and `u`.**

In this output state, the variable `d` retains its initial value of -1. The variables `v` and `u` are updated to the return values of the function `func_1` when called with the argument `-1`. The precondition that `remaining_vertices` must be non-empty and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
