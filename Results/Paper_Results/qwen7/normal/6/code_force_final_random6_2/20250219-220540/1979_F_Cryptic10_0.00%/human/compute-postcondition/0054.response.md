Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the value `v` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Given the initial state, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(-1)`, and `v` is no longer in the set `remaining_vertices`. The value of `d` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended to it.
