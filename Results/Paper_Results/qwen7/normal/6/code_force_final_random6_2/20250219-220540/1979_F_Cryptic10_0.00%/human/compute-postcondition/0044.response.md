Output State: **`d` is 0, `v` is updated to the current value of `v` and appended to `path`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(0)`, and if `v` equals 0, we continue the loop or iteration. Additionally, `v` is currently in the set `remaining_vertices`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` was previously in the set `remaining_vertices` and the condition `if v == 0` continues the loop, `v` remains unchanged in terms of its set membership. The values of `d` and `u` remain as they were in the initial state.
