Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)` after all iterations, and `path` contains all vertices that satisfy the given conditions.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `d` will start from `n-1` and decrement until it reaches -1. However, since the loop increments `d` back to -1 at the start of each iteration, `d` will always be -1 at the beginning of each iteration. The variables `v` and `u` will retain their values from the last call to `func_1(d)` before the loop ends. Additionally, the `path` list will contain all vertices that were added to it during the loop iterations, satisfying the condition `v in remaining_vertices`.
