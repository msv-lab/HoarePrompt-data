Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding 0, `d` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` is `n-2`, the updated `path` list now contains 0 and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
