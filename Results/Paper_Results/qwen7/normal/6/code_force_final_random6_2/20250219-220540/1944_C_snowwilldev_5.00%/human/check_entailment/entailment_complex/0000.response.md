Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The score is defined as the MEX of the array `c`, which is built by Alice and modified by Bob during their turns.

2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value. Instead, it simply counts the number of unique elements that appear exactly once in the array `a` and prints the first index where this condition is met or the length of the array if no such index exists.

3. This approach is incorrect because:
   - Alice can strategically choose elements to maximize the MEX value.
   - Bob can strategically remove elements to minimize the MEX value.
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob or consider their optimal strategies.

4. The correct approach would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob and maintaining the state of the arrays `a` and `c` accordingly. The MEX value should be calculated based on the final contents of `c`.

5. Given the provided annotated program, it does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the optimal MEX value.

Correctness: **False**
