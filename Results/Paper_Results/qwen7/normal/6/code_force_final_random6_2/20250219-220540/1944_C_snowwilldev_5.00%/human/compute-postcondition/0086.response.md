Output State: **`cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**.

In this scenario, the code increments the count of the value `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `N` must be greater than 0, this precondition remains unchanged. The only variable that has been updated is `cnt[a[i]]`, which now holds a value one greater than its previous value.
