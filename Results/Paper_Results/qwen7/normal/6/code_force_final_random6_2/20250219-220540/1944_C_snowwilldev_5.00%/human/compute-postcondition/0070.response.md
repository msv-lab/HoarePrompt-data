Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `tc` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `i`, and `tc` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
