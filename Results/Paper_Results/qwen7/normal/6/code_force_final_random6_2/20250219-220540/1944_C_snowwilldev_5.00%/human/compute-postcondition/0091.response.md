Output State: The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop. Specifically, for each integer `x` in the list `a`, `cnt[x]` will be equal to the number of times `x` appears in `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each `i` in the range of `N`), the dictionary `cnt` will have been updated to reflect the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The other variables (`tc`, `N`, and `i`) will no longer be relevant to the final state since the loop has completed.
