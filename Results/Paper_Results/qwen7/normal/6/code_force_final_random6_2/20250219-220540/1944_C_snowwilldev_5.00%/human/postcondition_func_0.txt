The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts the number of unique elements that appear exactly once in the array. If there are at least two such elements or if an element does not appear at all, it prints the index of the first such element and breaks the loop. If no such element is found, it prints the length of the array. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
