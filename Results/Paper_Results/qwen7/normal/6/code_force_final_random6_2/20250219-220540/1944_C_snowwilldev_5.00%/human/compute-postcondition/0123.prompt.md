Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), an integer representing the size of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is 3, i is 3, and N is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 3, `i` is `N`, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each value is incremented based on the count of each element in the list `a` up to index `N-1`, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is 3, i is 2, N is greater than 0, and cnt dictionary contains the count of each integer present in the list a after all iterations of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
