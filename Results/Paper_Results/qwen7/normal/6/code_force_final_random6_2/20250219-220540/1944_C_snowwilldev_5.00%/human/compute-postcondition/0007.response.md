Output State: **`cnt[a[0]]` is 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to \(2 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Given that `i` is 2, `cnt[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt[a[0]]` was initially set to 1, the updated state is `cnt[a[0]]` is 1 (unchanged because `i` is not 0) and `cnt[a[2]]` is now 1 (becomes 2 after incrementing). The other variables (`t`, `N`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
