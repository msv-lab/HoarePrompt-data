Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 3, `N` is an input integer, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with an integer default factory, meaning every key not present in the dictionary will automatically have a value of 0. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`t`, `i`, `N`, `tc`, and `a`).
