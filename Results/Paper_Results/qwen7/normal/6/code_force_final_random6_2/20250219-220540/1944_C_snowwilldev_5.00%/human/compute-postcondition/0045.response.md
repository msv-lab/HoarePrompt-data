Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 3.
   - `N` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `i < N` is true.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 3, we need to ensure that `N` is greater than 3 for the loop to start executing.
   - The value of `i` will change within the loop, but the initial value of `i` is 3, so we don't need to adjust it further.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that `N` is greater than 3 for the loop to start executing.
   - The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `a`, and `cnt`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 3, `N` must be greater than 3, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0**
