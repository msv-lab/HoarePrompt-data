Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 4, `cnt[a[i]]` is 1**

The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `a`, we cannot determine the exact key being incremented. However, we know that `a[i]` (where `i` is 4) is being used as a key in the dictionary `cnt`, and its count is being incremented by 1. Given the initial values of `t` and `i`, these remain unchanged.
