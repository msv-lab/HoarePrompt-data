Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for tc in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variable `tc` is being initialized in this loop head.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We are given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - This means `t` is the number of test cases.
   - The loop `for tc in range(int(input())):` will run `int(input())` times, where `input()` reads the value of `t`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set the initial state such that `int(input())` will read the correct value of `t`.
   - Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer within the specified range, we need to ensure that the input matches this value.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, because the loop will depend on the value of `t` being correctly inputted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4**
