Output State: **`cnt` is a default dictionary with all values initialized to 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with all values set to 0. The values of `t`, `N`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
