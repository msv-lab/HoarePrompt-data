Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 3
   - `i` is 3
   - `N` must be greater than 3
   - `tc` is 4
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0
   - `cnt[a[3]]` is incremented by 1

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < N`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`.
   - Since `N` must be greater than 3, let's assume `N` is at least 4 (the smallest value that satisfies this condition).
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 4.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains 3.
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `N` must still be greater than 3 (at least 4).

The other variables (`tc`, `a`, `cnt`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 4, `N` must be greater than 3**
