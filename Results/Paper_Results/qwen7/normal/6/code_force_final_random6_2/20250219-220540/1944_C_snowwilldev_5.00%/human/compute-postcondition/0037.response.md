Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, since no loop or conditional structure is specified, the variables `t`, `i`, and `N` retain their initial values as defined in the initial state. The condition regarding `cnt[i]` is not relevant here because the `break` statement does not affect these variables. Therefore, the output state remains as specified in the initial state.
