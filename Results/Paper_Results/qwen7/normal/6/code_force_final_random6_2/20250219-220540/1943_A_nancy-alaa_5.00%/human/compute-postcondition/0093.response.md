Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `first` is True, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each element into an integer, storing them in the list `arr`. The variables `i`, `n`, `first`, and `mpp` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new list `arr` contains the integers entered by the user.
