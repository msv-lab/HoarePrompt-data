Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2.
- `n` is mentioned to be at least 1 but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `first` is true, but it is not relevant to the print statement.
- `mpp[i]` is explicitly stated to equal 1, where `i` is 2, so `mpp[2]` is 1.

The print statement `print(i)` will simply output the value of `i`.

Output: **2**
