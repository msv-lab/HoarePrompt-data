Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The value of `n` determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`, `n` must be a non-negative integer.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`first`, `t`, `arr`, `mpp`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` should be a non-negative integer (since the loop will run as long as `i < n`).

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer**
