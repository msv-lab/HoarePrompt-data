Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the `print(i)` statement.
- There is a condition that if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `i` is 3 and the postcondition does not change, it implies that `3` is indeed a key in `mpp`.

Given this information, the `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
