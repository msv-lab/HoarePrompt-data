Output State: **`i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `i`, but it indicates that the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is inside. Given the initial state, the only change is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
