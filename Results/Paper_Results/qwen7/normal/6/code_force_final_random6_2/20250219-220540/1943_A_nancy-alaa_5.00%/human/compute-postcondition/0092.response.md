Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `first` is True, `mpp` is a Counter object with counts of elements from the input list `arr`**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user, provided it is greater than 3 (as per the initial state). The other variables (`i`, `first`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
