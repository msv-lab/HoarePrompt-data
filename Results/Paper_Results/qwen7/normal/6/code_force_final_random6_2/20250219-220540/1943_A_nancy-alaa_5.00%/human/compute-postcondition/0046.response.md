Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `first` is True, and `mpp` is a Counter object with counts of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `first`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged. The initial state of `n` being a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1 is preserved, and now `n` holds the specific integer value entered by the user.
