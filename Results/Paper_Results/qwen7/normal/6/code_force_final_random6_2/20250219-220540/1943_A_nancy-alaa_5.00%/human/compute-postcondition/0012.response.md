Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
   - `first` is true (though it's not relevant to the print statement).
   - Either `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or `mpp[i]` equals 1. Since `i` is 0, we need to check if 0 is a key in `mpp` or if `mpp[0]` equals 1. If neither condition is met, the first condition would be true.

2. The print statement is `print(i)`, which simply prints the value of `i`.

3. Given that `i` is explicitly stated to be 0, the print statement will output 0.

Output: **0**
