Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The current value of `i` (which is 0) is not in the keys of `mpp`.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `i`, which is explicitly given as 0.

Output: **0**
