Output State: `i` is `bets * 2 - 2`; `ans` is the concatenation of all elements in list `a` separated by spaces.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `bets * 2 - 2` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. The variable `ans` will contain the concatenation of all elements in list `a` separated by spaces, as each element `a[i]` is appended to `ans` in each iteration of the loop.
