Output State: **`ans` is the current value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is incremented by 1, `bets` must be the same**.

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the value of `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the current value of `ans`. It also increments the value of `i` by 1. The value of `bets` remains unchanged.
