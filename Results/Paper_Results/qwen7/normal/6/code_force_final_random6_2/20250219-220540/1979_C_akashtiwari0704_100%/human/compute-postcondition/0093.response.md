Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(l)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
   - `i` is `i + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(l)`. 

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(l)`. Therefore, `i` must be `i + 1` and it must still be less than `len(l)`.

5. **State the new state**:
   - `g` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `len(l)` remains unchanged.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 2`, `len(l)` must be greater than `i + 1`**
