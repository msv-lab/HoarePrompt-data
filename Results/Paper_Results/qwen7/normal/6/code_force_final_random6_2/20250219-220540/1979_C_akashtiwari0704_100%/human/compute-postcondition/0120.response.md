Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `bets`.
   - `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `bets-1`. This means `i` will start from `0` and go up to `bets-1`.

4. **Initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is initially set to `bets`, and `bets` is at least 10, `i` will start from at least 10 (if `bets` is exactly 10) and go up to `bets-1`.

5. **Loop execution requirement**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[0, bets-1]`. Given that `i` starts at `bets` and decreases in the loop, the loop will not execute if `bets` is less than 10 because `i` would never reach the range `[0, bets-1]`.

6. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `bets` must be at least 10, and `i` should start from `bets` and decrease in the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `bets` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10**
