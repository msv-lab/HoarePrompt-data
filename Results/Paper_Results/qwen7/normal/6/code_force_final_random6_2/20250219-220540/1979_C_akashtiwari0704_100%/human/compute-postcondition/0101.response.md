Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `sumo` is 33, `a[i]` is `prod // 20`, `i` is 8, `ans` is "11 11 11 11 11", `T` is 9, `t` must be greater than or equal to 9, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `bets`, `sumo`, `a[i]`, `i`, `ans`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
