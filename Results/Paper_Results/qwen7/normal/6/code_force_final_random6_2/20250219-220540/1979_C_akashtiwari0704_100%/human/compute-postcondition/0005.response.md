Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(l))`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `g` is `l[0]`
   - `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(l)` must remain the same as it was in the previous iteration because the length of the list does not change within the loop body (we are not modifying `l` here).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `g` remains `l[0]`.
   - `l` still has at least 1 element.
   - `i` becomes 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is 0, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1**
