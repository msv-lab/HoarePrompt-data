Output State: **`t` is 0, `g` is 1**

The initial state indicates that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), but the specific value of `t` is given as 0. The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `g`. Since the value of `t` does not change from its initial state (which is 0, even though it violates the condition of being greater than 0), and `g` is explicitly set to 1, the output state reflects these changes.
