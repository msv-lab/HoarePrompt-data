Output State: **`i` is 3, `bets` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `t` remains 0, `g` is `l[1] * l[2] * l[3] // gcd(gcd(l[1], l[2]), l[3])`, `prod` remains unchanged, `sumo` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `g * l[3] // gcd(g, l[3])`. Since `g` was initially `l[1] * l[2] // gcd(l[1], l[2])`, the new value of `g` is `l[1] * l[2] * l[3] // gcd(gcd(l[1], l[2]), l[3])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
