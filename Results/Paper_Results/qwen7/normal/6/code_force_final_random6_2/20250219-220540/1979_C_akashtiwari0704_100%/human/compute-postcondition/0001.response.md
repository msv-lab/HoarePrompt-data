State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, T is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The loop condition `range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(0)` would result in no iterations.
- Additionally, `t` is constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive as given in the problem statement.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
