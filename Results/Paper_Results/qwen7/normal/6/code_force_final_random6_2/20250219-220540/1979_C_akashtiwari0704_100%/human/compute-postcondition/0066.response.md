Output State: **`sumo' is increased by the integer value of `a[i]' and `a[i]' is updated to `prod // a[i]'**.

This means that the value of `sumo` has been incremented by the integer value of `a[i]`, and the value of `a[i]` has been updated to the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
