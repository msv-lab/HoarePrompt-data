Output State: **`sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. The other variables `bets` and `a[i]` are updated according to the initial state, where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`. The condition that `bets` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
