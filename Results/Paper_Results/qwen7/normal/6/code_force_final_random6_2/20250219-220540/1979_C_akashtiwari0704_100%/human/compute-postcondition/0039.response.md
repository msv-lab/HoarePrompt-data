Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved, which are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is 'a[0]a[1]'
   - `bets` must be greater than 0

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `bets` must remain greater than 0 because it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `ans` remains 'a[0]a[1]' (since it is not affected by the loop)
   - `bets` must still be greater than 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 'a[0]a[1]', `bets` must be greater than 0**
