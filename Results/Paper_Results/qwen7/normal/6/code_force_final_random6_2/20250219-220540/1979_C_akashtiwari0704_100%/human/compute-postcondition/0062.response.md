Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`. The precondition that `bets` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the value of `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]`. No other variables are affected.
