Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `i` is the length of list `l`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sumo` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all the variables as they were in the initial state, with the addition of `sumo` being set to 0.
