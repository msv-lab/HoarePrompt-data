Output State: `ans` is "11 11 11 ", `i` is 8, `bets` is 5, `sumo` is 33.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = bets - 1`, which means it will run 5 times since `bets` is 5. In each iteration, `ans` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Given that `a[i]` is consistently 11, `ans` will be updated as follows:

- After the 1st iteration: `ans` becomes "11 "
- After the 2nd iteration: `ans` becomes "11 11 "
- After the 3rd iteration: `ans` becomes "11 11 11 "
- After the 4th iteration: `ans` becomes "11 11 11 11 "
- After the 5th iteration: `ans` becomes "11 11 11 11 11 "

After all iterations, `i` will be incremented by 5 (since it starts at 5 and increments by 1 each time), making `i` equal to 8. The values of `sumo` and `bets` remain unchanged.
