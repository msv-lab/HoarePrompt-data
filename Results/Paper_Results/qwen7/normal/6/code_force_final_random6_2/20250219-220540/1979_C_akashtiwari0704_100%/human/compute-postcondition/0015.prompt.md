You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, T is 0
    g = 1
    for i in range(len(l)):
        g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the length of list `l`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the value of the product of all elements in the list `l`, divided by the GCD of each pair of elements as they are multiplied together. The variable `t` remains 0, `l` remains the same list it started with, and `i` will be equal to the length of list `l`.
    return g
        def lcm(l):
        #Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `l` where each element must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. It returns the product of all elements in the list `l`, divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each pair of elements as they are multiplied together.
    #The program returns the product of all elements in list `l`, divided by the GCD of each pair of elements as they are multiplied together.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the product of all elements in list `l`, divided by the GCD of each pair of elements as they are multiplied together.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
