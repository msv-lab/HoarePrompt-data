Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])` if `i < m`, otherwise `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `x += min(a[i], b[i])` updates the value of `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`. This update is only retained if `i < m`. The values of `i`, `n`, `pergunta`, and `x` follow the given postconditions, meaning `i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pergunta` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`, and `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])` if `i < m`. If `i >= m`, the values of `pergunta` and `x` remain unchanged from their preconditions.
