Functionality: **The function accepts five parameters: `pergunta` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `a` (a list of n integers), `b` (a list of n integers), `n` (an integer), and `m` (an integer). The function processes each test case based on the given constraints and returns a result for each case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving two lists of integers (`a` and `b`), and two additional integers (`n` and `m`). The function will perform some operations based on these inputs and return a specific result for each test case, adhering to the constraints provided.
