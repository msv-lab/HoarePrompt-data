Output State: **`nums` is still a sorted list of integers including '0', `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 2, `ls` is `ls + nums[2] - ls`**

Explanation: The code `nums[i] -= ls` subtracts `ls` from `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `nums[i]` becomes `nums[2] - ls`. Since `ls` was previously `ls + nums[2]`, the new value of `ls` becomes `ls + nums[2] - ls`, which simplifies to just `nums[2]`. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
