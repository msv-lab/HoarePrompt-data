Output State: **`cw` is `True`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is the length of `nums`, `nw` is `True`.**

Explanation: The line `cw = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `cw`. The values of the other variables (`ls`, `nums`, `i`, and `nw`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
