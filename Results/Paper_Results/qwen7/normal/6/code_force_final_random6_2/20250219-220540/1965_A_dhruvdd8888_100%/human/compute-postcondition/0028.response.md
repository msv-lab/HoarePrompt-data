Output State: **`cw` is `False`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is `len(nums) - 3`, `nw` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `cw = not nw` changes the value of `cw` to the opposite of `nw`. Since `nw` was initially `True`, `cw` is now `False`. The other variables (`ls`, `nums`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
