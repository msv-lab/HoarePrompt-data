Output State: `cw` is `True`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is 0, `nw` is `True`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` down to 1. After each iteration, `i` decreases by 1. Since the loop condition is `range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1)`, it will run `len(nums) - 2` times. When the loop completes, `i` will be reduced to 0. At this point, `cw` remains `True` because the last value of `nw` before the loop ends is `True`. All other variables (`ls`, `nums`, and `nw`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
