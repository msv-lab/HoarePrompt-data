Output State: **`cw` is `not cw`, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is `len(nums) - 4`, `nw` is `cw`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `cw` is updated to `not cw`. This means if `cw` was `False`, it becomes `True`, and vice versa.
- The variables `ls`, `nums`, `i`, and `nw` remain unchanged from their previous states.
