Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile is not defined in this snippet, so it remains as described in the initial state.
