Output State: **`nums` is still a sorted list of integers including '0', `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 1, `ls` is `ls + nums[1]`**.

Explanation: The value of `ls` is incremented by `nums[i]`, where `i` is 1. So, `ls` becomes `ls + nums[1]`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
