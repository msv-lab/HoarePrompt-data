Output State: **`nums` is still a sorted list of integers including '0', `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - ls`, `i` is 3, `ls` is `ls + nums[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `nums` being a sorted list of integers including '0', `nums[1]` being `nums[1] - ls`, `i` being 2, and `ls` being `ls + nums[2] - ls`.
- The code `ls += nums[i]` increments `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `ls` is incremented by `nums[2]`.
- Therefore, `ls` becomes `ls + nums[2]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Thus, the final state is as described above.
