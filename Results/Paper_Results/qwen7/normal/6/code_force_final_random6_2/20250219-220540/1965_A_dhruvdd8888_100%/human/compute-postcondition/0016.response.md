Output State: **`ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is the length of `nums`, `nw` is True.**

Explanation: The code `nw = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `nw`. This assignment does not affect the values of `ls`, `nums`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions where `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', and `i` is the length of `nums`. The variable `nw` is now set to `True`.
