Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop starts with `i = len(nums) - 3` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `i` starts at `len(nums) - 3` and decreases by 1 each iteration, it will continue to be valid until `i` reaches 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be decreased by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 4`.
   - `cw` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ls` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nw` will be updated to the current value of `cw` since `nw` is initialized to `cw` before the loop starts and remains `cw` throughout the loop.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be `len(nums) - 4`.
- `cw` remains `False` if `nums[i]` is equal to 1, and `True` if `nums[i]` is not equal to 1.
- `ls` remains the sum of all elements in `nums`.
- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers including '0'.
- `nw` remains `cw`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `cw` is `False` if `nums[len(nums) - 4]` is equal to 1, and `True` if `nums[len(nums) - 4]` is not equal to 1; `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`; `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0'; `i` is `len(nums) - 4`; `nw` is `cw`.**
