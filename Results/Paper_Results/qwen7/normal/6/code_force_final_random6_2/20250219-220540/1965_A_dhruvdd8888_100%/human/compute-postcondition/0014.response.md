Output State: `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `nums` is a sorted list of integers including '0', `i` is equal to the length of `nums`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `ls` will accumulate the value of each element in `nums`. Since the loop runs for each index from 0 to len(nums)-1, `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` after the last iteration. The order of `nums` remains sorted and includes '0' as per the initial condition and no changes within the loop affect this order or inclusion.
