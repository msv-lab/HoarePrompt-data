Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
2. The `func_1` function checks if there is any index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. If such an index exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a template can be constructed where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
3. However, this function does not fully address the problem requirements. It only checks if there is a single index where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.
4. The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each case and printing the results.
5. To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that for every character in `a` and `b` at a given index, it must either be equal to `c` or different from `c` depending on the template character being lowercase or uppercase. `func_1` does not account for this distinction between lowercase and uppercase characters in the template.
6. Therefore, `func_1` alone is insufficient to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
