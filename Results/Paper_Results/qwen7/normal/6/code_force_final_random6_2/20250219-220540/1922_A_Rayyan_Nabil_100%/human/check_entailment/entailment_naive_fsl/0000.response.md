Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that there exists a valid template `t` where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  mathforces
  luckforces
  adhoccoder
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The function `func_1` will return 'NO' because there is no position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, we can construct a valid template `t` such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. For example, the template `T` could be `"MaTHFORCES"`. Here:
- `a` ("mathforces") matches `T` because all letters are in the correct case.
- `b` ("luckforces") matches `T` because all letters are in the correct case.
- `c` ("adhoccoder") does not match `T` because 'a' is not the same as 'A' and 'd' is not the same as 'D'.

Since the function does not correctly handle this case, the program is incorrect.
