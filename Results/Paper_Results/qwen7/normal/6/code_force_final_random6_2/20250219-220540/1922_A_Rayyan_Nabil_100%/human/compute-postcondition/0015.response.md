Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`
   - `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace
   - `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
   - `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
   - `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
   - `t` must be greater than 0

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, it is the only one that needs to be adjusted.

4. **Formulate the new state**: After the loop runs once, `t` will be decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` will run from `0` to `t-1`). Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is a new string obtained by stripping the input of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `t` must be greater than 1.**
