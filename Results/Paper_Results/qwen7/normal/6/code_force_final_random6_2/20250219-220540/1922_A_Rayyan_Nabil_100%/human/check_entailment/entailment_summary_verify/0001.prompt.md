You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). It then calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and stores the return values in a list. Finally, it prints the return values of `func_1` for all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string where each character can be either lowercase or uppercase.
   - If a character in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
   - If a character in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of that character.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not equal `c[i]`.
   - If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This function only checks if `a` and `b` can potentially match the same template as `c` does not, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can indeed match a template while `c` cannot.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Checking the Logic of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incomplete because it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` can differ from `c[i]`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot.
   - For example, consider the test case:
     ```
     4
     2
     aa
     bb
     aa
     ```
     Here, `a` and `b` are both "aa", and `c` is also "aa". According to the problem statement, `a` and `b` should match a template, and `c` should not. However, `func_1` will return 'NO' because `a` and `b` do not differ from `c`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` can match but `c` cannot.
   - One way to do this is to compare each character of `a` and `b` with `c` and ensure that for each position, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, then a template can be constructed.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not fully satisfy the conditions required by the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
