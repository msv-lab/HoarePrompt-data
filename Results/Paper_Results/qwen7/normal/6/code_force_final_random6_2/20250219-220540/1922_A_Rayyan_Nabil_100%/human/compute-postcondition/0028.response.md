Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `result` is the third element in the `results` list.

The `print(result)` statement will print the third element in the `results` list. Since `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, `result` specifically refers to the return value from the third iteration of `func_1`.

However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine the precise value of `result`. But we know it is the return value from the third call to `func_1`.

Output: **the return value from the third call to func_1(n, a, b, c)**
