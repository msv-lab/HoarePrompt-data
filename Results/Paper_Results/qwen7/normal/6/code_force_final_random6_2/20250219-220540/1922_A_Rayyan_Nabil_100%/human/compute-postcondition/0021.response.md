Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to the list `results`. The values of `c`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are stripped strings and integers respectively. The `results` list now contains the return value of the function call along with its previous contents.
