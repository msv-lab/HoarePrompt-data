Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the 1000 iterations of the loop, `t` is 1000, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the last (1000th) element in the `results` list.

In this final state, the `results` list will contain the return values from calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` exactly 1000 times, with `t` set to 1000 indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `c`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state, since these values do not change within the loop. The `result` variable will hold the value returned by `func_1(n, a, b, c)` during the last iteration of the loop.
