Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over the `results` list, so the only variable in the loop head is `result`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration.
   - `result` is the second element in the `results` list.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the next `result` to be processed will be the third element in the `results` list.
   - All other variables (`t`, `c`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `result` is the third element in the `results` list**
