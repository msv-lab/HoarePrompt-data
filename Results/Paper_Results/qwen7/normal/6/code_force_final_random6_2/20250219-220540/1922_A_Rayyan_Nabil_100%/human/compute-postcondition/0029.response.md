Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the 1000 iterations of the loop, `t` is the integer 1000, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration, `result` is the last element in the `results` list.

This means that after the loop has executed all 1000 iterations, `results` will contain the return values from `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration, with `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` being the same for each call as they were when the loop started. The variable `t` remains set to 1000, indicating the total number of iterations.
