Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, and `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since no other variables are directly affected by the loop itself (other than `t`), we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

5. **Final State**: After adjusting the state, the new state should reflect that `t` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0**.
