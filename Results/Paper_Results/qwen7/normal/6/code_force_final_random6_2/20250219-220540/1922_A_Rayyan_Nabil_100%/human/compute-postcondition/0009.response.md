The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, and `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `t` must be greater than 0**
