Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration.
   - `result` is the second element in the `results` list.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

Given that `result` is explicitly stated to be the second element in the `results` list, we need to determine the value of this element.

Since the exact function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and the specific values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is the return value of `func_1` for some iteration where `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have been processed.

Therefore, the output will be the return value of `func_1` for the second call with the appropriate parameters.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1 for the second call with parameters n, a, b, and c)**
