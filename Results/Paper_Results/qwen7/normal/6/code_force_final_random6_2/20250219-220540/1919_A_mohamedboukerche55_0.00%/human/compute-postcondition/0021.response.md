Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it reads `t` pairs of integers `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and prints 'bob' if the sum is even, or 'alice' if the sum is odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'bob' or 'alice' for each pair of integers `a` and `b` based on the parity of their sum.**
