Output State: **`s` is an input string, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into a list using spaces as delimiters. The first element of this list is converted to an integer and assigned to `a`. Similarly, the second element of the list is converted to an integer and assigned to `b`. The initial state of `s` and the relationship between `a` and the first element of the split list, and `b` and the second element of the split list, are preserved in the output state.
