Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the game rules as described. According to the problem statement, the game involves two players taking turns, and the winner is determined based on whether they can make a valid move when it is their turn. The program, however, simply checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` and prints 'bob' or 'alice' based on that. This approach does not account for the game's turn-based nature and the ability of the players to swap wallets.

The program should simulate the game's turns and determine the winner based on optimal play. However, the provided code does not do this; instead, it makes a decision based on the sum of `a` and `b` alone, which is not a valid solution for the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
