Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to an integer value obtained from user input.
- `s` is the last string input received.
- `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.
- `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

The print statement is `print('alice')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'alice'` without referencing any of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **alice**
