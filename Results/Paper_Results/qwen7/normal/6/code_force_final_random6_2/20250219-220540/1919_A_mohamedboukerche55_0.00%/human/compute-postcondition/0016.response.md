Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the integer value of the input.
- `s` is the last input string received.
- `a` is the integer value of the first element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.
- `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list obtained by splitting `s` on spaces.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even.

The print statement is:
```python
print('bob  ')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'bob  '` with a trailing space. Since no variables from the initial state are used in this print statement, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **bob  **
