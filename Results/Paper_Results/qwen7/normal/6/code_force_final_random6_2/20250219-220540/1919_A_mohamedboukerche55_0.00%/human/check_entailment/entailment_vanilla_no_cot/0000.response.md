Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program splits the input string `s` and converts the first and second elements to integers. However, it should directly split the input into two separate integers without converting them to lists and then back to integers.

2. **Winning Condition Logic**: The condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is not correctly applied to determine the winner. According to the problem statement, the player who plays optimally will win if the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd. If the sum is even, the player who starts (Alice) will lose because she will eventually be forced to make a move when the sum becomes odd, which means her opponent (Bob) will win.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly parses the input and applies the winning condition logic accurately.
