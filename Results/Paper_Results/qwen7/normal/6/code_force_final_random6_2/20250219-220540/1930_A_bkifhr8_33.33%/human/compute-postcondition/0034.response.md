Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` remains the same as the previous iteration, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` (converted to integers), and `lst` is modified by removing the element at index 0, unless the length of `lst` is 2, in which case `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
