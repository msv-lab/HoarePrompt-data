Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` remains the same as the previous iteration, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` (converted to integers), and `lst` is modified by removing the first element, unless `len(lst) != 2`, in which case `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the loop or if statement is exited.
