Postcondition: `i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and if the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element of `lst` (index 1) is removed; otherwise, the value of `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.
