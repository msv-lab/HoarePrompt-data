Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains the same as the previous iteration, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` converted to integers, `lst` is modified by removing the element at index 0.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which simplifies to `0`. Therefore, the first element of `lst` is removed. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated by adding the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` after they have been converted to integers.
