Output State: **`i` is 1, `i` is less than `n * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it implies that the `break` statement is part of a larger context not shown here. However, based on the given information, the only thing we can definitively say is that the `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement we are currently inside. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the calculation of `ans` also remains unchanged as the `break` does not affect it.
