Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that are used within the loop. In this case, the loop uses the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `i` is incremented by 1. This means `i` starts from 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n * 2)`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n * 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n * 2` for the loop to execute.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `ans_f`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `lst`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `i` must be less than `n * 2`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than `n * 2`**.
