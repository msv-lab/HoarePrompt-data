Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `lst` has at most two elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement that was being executed. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `ans`, and `lst` within the `break` statement itself, their previous values remain unchanged.
