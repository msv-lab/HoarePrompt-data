Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` remains the same as the previous iteration, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` updates the value of `ans` by adding the minimum value between the first and second elements of the list `lst`, after converting them to integers. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
