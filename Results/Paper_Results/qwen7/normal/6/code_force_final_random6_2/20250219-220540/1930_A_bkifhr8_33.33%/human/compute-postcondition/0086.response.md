Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n * 2`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `i` is less than or equal to `n * 2` (postcondition from the previous iteration).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is increased by the minimum value between the elements of `lst`.
   - If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has one element less and the first element at index 0 is removed.
   - If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i < n * 2`. Therefore, `i + 1` must still be less than `n * 2`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` before, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- The conditions involving `ans` and `lst` remain the same since they are not directly affected by the loop increment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is increased by the minimum value between the elements of `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has one element less and the first element at index 0 is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.**
