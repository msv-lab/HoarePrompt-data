Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `ans` was being updated. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and the condition `i <= n * 2` and the fact that `ans` was increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are still valid.
