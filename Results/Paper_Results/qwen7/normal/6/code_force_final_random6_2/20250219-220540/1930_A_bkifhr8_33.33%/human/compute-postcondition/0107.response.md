Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ans_f` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is equal to an element in `ans_f`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in ans_f:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `ans_f`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which takes the value of elements from `ans_f` one by one.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to some element in `ans_f`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take the value of another element in `ans_f`.

### Adjusted States:
- Since `ans_f` must contain at least one element, it still contains at least one element after the previous iteration.
- `i` will now take the value of another element in `ans_f`.

### Final State:
- `ans_f` must still contain at least one element.
- `i` will now be equal to another element in `ans_f`.

### Answer:
State: **`ans_f` must contain at least one element, `i` is equal to another element in `ans_f`**
