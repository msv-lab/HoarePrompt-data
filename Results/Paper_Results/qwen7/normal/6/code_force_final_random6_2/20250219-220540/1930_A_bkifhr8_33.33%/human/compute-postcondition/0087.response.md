Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and the value of `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. Since the length of `lst` is assumed to be 2, the operation is performed as intended. The conditions about the length of `lst` and the removal of its first element if the length is not 2 are not applicable here because the length is exactly 2. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
