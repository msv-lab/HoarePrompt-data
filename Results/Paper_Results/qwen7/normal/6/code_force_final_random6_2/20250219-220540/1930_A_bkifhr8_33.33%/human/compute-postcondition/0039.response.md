Output State: **`ans` is 0, `ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n`, but does not affect the values of `ans`, `ans_f`, `i`, or `t`. The loop condition and the calculation of `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` remains 0, `ans_f` still contains the last computed value of `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, and `n` is set to the input integer.
