Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `ans_f`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `2 * n + 1`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans` (which is 0), and `ans` is still 0. The value of `n` is now an integer input from the user.
