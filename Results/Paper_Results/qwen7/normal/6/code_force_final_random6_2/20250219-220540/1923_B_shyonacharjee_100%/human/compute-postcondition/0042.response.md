Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples that must have at least one element, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

The code calculates the absolute value of `pos` and assigns it to the variable `distance`. The values of `monsters`, `pos`, and `health` remain unchanged from their initial states.
