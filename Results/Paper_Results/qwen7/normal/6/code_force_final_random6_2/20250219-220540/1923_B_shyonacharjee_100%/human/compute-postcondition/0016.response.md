Output State: **`monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `bullets_used` is increased by `health`.**

This means that the `bullets_used` variable has been updated by adding the value of `health` to it. All other variables remain in their initial states relative to the given conditions.
