Postcondition: **`monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `pos` is the second element of the next tuple in the list, `health` is the first element of the next tuple in the list, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `bullets_used` is increased by `health`, and if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
