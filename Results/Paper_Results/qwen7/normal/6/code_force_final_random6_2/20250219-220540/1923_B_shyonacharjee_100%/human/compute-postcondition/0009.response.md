Output State: **`monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute value of `pos` to the variable `distance`. The list `monsters` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it. The value of `distance` is now known to be the absolute value of `pos`.
