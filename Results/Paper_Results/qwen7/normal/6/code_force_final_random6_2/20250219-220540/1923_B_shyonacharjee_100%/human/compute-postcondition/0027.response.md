Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by the health of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` is `False`, and `distance` is set to `abs(pos)`**.

The code sets `can_survive` to `False`, which means the condition for survival is not met. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
