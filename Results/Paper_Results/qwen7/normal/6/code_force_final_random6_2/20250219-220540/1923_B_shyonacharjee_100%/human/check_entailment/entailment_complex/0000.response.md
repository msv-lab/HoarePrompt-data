Reasoning:
- The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position.
- The function `func_1()` reads the input for each test case, processes the data, and prints the appropriate output ('YES' or 'NO') based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The sorting of monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(pos)`) ensures that the closest monsters are dealt with first, which is crucial for the strategy of using bullets efficiently.
- The logic for checking if the player can survive involves calculating the total bullets needed to defeat the monsters at their current positions and comparing it with the maximum bullets available per unit distance (`distance * k`). If at any point the required bullets exceed the available bullets, the player cannot survive, and 'NO' is printed.
- The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
