Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * health`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_bullets_needed` to be the sum of `bullets_used` (which is `health`) and `health` itself. Therefore, `total_bullets_needed` becomes `2 * health`. The other variables remain unchanged.
