Output State: **`bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least three tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of the next `pos` in the list, `total_bullets_needed` is `2 * health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`**.

This means that the variable `distance` is now set to the absolute value of `pos`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
