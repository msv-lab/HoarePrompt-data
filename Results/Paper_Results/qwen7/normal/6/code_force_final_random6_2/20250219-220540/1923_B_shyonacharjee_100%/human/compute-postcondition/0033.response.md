Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **can_survive**: The initial state explicitly states that `can_survive` is `False`.
2. **bullets_used**: The initial state does not provide a specific value for `bullets_used`, but it is defined as the sum of the `health` values of all monsters. This means `bullets_used` is a numeric value representing the total health points of all monsters combined.
3. **Print Statement**: The print statement uses a conditional expression to determine the output string. Since `can_survive` is `False`, the expression evaluates to `'NO'`.

Given this information, the print statement will output `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
