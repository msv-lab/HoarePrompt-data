Output State: **`n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `t` is greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `map(int, stdin.readline().split())`. This does not change the value of `t`, which must still be greater than 0. Therefore, the updated states are that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, and `t` remains greater than 0.
