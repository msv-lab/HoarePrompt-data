Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the first and second space-separated values in input respectively.
   - If `n` equals `k`, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `n` and `k` are updated to their respective integer values from the input.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - After each iteration, `t` should be reduced by 1.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, `t` will be decremented by 1.

**Final State:**
- `t` must be greater than 0 (since it was greater than 1 before and is decremented by 1).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
