### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If Alice has `n` coins, she will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall before moving to the next one.
   - The goal is to either find a way to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels or determine that it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, which ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - It then checks if `n + 2 > k * 2`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls:
     - The first stall with a price of `n - k + 1` coins.
     - The second stall with a price of 1 coin.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NO".

3. **Testing the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: \( n = k \)**
     - The solution correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - **Case 2: \( n + 2 > k * 2 \)**
     - For example, if \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 3 \), the condition \( 7 + 2 > 3 * 2 \) is true. The solution prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls: the first with a price of \( 7 - 3 + 1 = 5 \) coins and the second with a price of 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys 3 jewels.
   - **Case 3: \( n + 2 \le k * 2 \)**
     - For example, if \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \), the condition \( 6 + 2 \le 4 * 2 \) is false. The solution prints "NO", which is correct because Alice cannot buy exactly 4 jewels with only 6 coins.

4. **Reviewing the Function Summary:**
   - The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \) and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with some integers if applicable.
   - If \( n \) equals \( k \), it prints 'YES 1 1'.
   - If \( n + 2 > k * 2 \), it prints 'YES 2' followed by \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution correctly handles the main conditions and examples given in the problem statement.
   - However, the solution does not cover all possible scenarios. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where \( n < k \) and \( n + 2 \le k * 2 \).

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Case 4: \( n < k \)**
  - For example, if \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 6 \), the condition \( n + 2 > k * 2 \) is false, and the condition \( n = k \) is also false. The solution prints "NO", which is correct.
- **Case 5: \( n \ge k \) and \( n + 2 \le k * 2 \)**
  - For example, if \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 5 \), the condition \( n + 2 > k * 2 \) is false, and the condition \( n = k \) is also false. The solution prints "NO", which is correct.

However, the solution does not provide a general approach to handle the case where \( n \ge k \) and \( n + 2 \le k * 2 \) by setting up more than 2 stalls. The solution only considers setting up 2 stalls, which is insufficient for all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment concluded that the solution is correct, but it did not fully cover all possible scenarios. The solution is incomplete and may fail in certain edge cases.

**Final: False**
