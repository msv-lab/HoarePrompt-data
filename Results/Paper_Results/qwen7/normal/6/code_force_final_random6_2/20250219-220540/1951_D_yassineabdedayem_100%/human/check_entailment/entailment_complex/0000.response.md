Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Conditions and Outputs**:
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES 1 1". This means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if the price of each jewel is 1 coin, and only one stall is needed.
   - If `n + 2 > 2 * k`, the program prints "YES 2" followed by `n - k + 1` and `1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels using two stalls. The first stall sells jewels at a price of `n - k + 1` coins, and the second stall sells jewels at 1 coin. This setup allows Alice to buy the required number of jewels.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NO", indicating it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `n` and `k` are equal or where the conditions allow setting up two stalls to achieve the desired number of jewels.
   - The constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) are respected, and the program ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

Given the logical correctness of the conditions and the appropriate handling of different scenarios, the program accurately determines whether Bob can set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **True**
