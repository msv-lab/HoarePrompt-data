### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If Alice has `n` coins, she will buy as many jewels as possible from each stall before moving to the next one.
   - The goal is to either find a way to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels or determine that it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If they are equal, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, which ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - It then checks if `n + 2 > k * 2`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls:
     - The first stall with a price of `n - k + 1` coins.
     - The second stall with a price of 1 coin.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NO".

3. **Testing the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: \( n = k \)**
     - The solution correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - **Case 2: \( n + 2 > k * 2 \)**
     - For example, if \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 3 \), the condition \( 7 + 2 > 3 * 2 \) is true. The solution prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls: the first with a price of \( 7 - 3 + 1 = 5 \) coins and the second with a price of 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys 3 jewels.
   - **Case 3: \( n + 2 \le k * 2 \)**
     - For example, if \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \), the condition \( 6 + 2 \le 4 * 2 \) is false. The solution prints "NO", which is correct because Alice cannot buy exactly 4 jewels with only 6 coins.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided solution handles the given examples correctly and covers the main conditions needed to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
