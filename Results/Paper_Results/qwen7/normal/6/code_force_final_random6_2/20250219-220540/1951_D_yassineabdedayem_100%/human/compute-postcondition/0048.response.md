Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). It returns different values based on the conditions specified for `n` and `k`.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `n`, and `k`. The function does not accept `t`, `n`, or `k` as direct parameters but uses them internally to determine the output. For each test case, it checks the values of `n` and `k` and returns a specific value based on those conditions.
