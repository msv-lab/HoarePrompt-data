Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input.
- The current value of `n` is equal to `k`.

The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
