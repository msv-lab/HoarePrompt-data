Output State: **`cnt` is the sum of all elements in the list `v`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is the sum of two parts: 1. The first part is the sum of `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` where `v[i]` is at least 3. 2. The second part is the sum of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` for all `i` where `v[i]` is at least 2. `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `cnt`, `idx`, or `ans`. The loop has executed `n + 1` times, updating `cnt` and `ans` according to the given conditions. The list `results` now contains one element, which is the string representation of `ans`.
