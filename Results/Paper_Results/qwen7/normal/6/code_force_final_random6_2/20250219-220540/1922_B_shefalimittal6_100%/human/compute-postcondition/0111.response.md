Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns an integer value from `data[idx]` to the variable `x`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `x` is now an integer derived from the specified index in the `data` list.
