Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` takes the first element of the list `data` (which is at index `idx`), converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `t`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented by 1 because the next element in the list will be accessed in subsequent operations. The other variables (`data`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
