Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is incremented by 1 and increased by 1 again.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `idx` is increased by 1, as stated in the initial state. The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1, and then it is incremented by 1 again due to the code snippet `v[x] += 1`. Therefore, `v[x]` is effectively incremented by 2.
