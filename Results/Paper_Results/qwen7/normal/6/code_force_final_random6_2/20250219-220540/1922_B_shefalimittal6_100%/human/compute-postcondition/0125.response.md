Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times; `idx` is increased by `n`; `v[x]` is incremented `n` times for each `x` which is an integer from `data[idx - n]` to `data[idx - 1]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `idx`, `v`, `data`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, with the addition of `ans` being set to 0.
