Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is increased by 1**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial conditions for `n` and the value range for `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1, and `idx` is increased by 1.
