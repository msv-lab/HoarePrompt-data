Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the last input split, `f` is the second integer from the last input split, `g` is the first integer from the last input split, `h` is the second integer from the last input split, `n` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - b)\), and `x` is \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\). If `x` is greater than `n`, the function prints `n`; otherwise, it prints `x`. The loop has completed all its iterations, so `steps` will be `t-1`.
