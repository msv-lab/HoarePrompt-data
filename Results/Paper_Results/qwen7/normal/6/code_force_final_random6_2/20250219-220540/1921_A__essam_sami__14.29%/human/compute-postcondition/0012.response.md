Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `steps` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` is the first integer entered.
- `d` is the second integer entered.
- `e` is the first integer from the input split.
- `f` is the second integer from the input split.
- `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer.
- `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\) and is less than or equal to `n`.

The print statement outputs the value of `x`, which is \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).

Output: **(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)**
