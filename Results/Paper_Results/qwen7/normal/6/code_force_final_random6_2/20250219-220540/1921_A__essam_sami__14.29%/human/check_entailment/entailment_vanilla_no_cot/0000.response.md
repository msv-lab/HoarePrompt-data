Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify the corners of the square and calculate its area. The logic used to determine which pair of points to consider as the diagonal of the square is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Distances**: The program calculates the squared distance between pairs of points but does not ensure these points are diagonally opposite corners of the square.
2. **Assumption of Diagonal Points**: The program assumes that the maximum distance calculated is always the diagonal of the square, which is not necessarily true without proper verification.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to verify that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Check all combinations of points to find the correct ones forming the square
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                for k in range(j+1, 4):
                    for l in range(k+1, 4):
                        p1, p2, p3, p4 = points[i], points[j], points[k], points[l]
                        dx1, dy1 = p2[0] - p1[0], p2[1] - p1[1]
                        dx2, dy2 = p3[0] - p1[0], p3[1] - p1[1]
                        dx3, dy3 = p4[0] - p1[0], p4[1] - p1[1]
                        
                        # Check if the sides are equal and perpendicular
                        if (dx1 == 0 and dy1 != 0 and dx2 == 0 and dy2 != 0 and dx3 == 0 and dy3 != 0) or \
                           (dx1 != 0 and dy1 == 0 and dx2 != 0 and dy2 == 0 and dx3 != 0 and dy3 == 0):
                            side_length = abs(dx1)
                            area = side_length * side_length
                            print(area)
                            break
```

This corrected version ensures that the points are checked in all possible combinations to form the square and then calculates the area correctly.
