Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 1, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`, `e` is an integer from the input split, `f` is an integer from the input split, `g` is updated to the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is updated to the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is updated to `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`**.

This means that `n` is now updated to the value of `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
