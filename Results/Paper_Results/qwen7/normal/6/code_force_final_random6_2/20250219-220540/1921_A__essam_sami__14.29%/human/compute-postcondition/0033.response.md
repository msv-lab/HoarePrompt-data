Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though it's not used in the code snippet).
- `steps` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user.
- `c` is the first integer entered.
- `d` is the second integer entered.
- `e` is the first integer from the input split, which is the same as `c`.
- `f` is the second integer from the input split, which is the same as `d`.
- `g` is the first integer from the input split, which is the same as `c`.
- `h` is the second integer from the input split, which is the same as `d`.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), which simplifies to \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).

Given this, the expression for `n` is:

\[ n = (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 \]

Since `c` and `d` are the same as `e` and `f` respectively, and `e` and `f` are the same as `c` and `d`, the expression simplifies further to:

\[ n = (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 \]

When the `print(n)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `n`.

Output: **(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2**
