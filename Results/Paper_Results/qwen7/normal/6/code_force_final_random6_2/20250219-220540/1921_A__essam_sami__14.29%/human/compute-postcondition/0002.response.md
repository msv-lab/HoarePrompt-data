Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `steps` remain unchanged from their initial state.
