Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) test cases, where each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each test case, the function determines if the given coordinates form a valid square and returns a boolean value indicating whether the square is valid or not.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases without needing any input parameters directly passed to it. Instead, it reads the test cases from the input and checks if the given coordinates form a valid square. It then returns a boolean value for each test case indicating whether the square is valid.
