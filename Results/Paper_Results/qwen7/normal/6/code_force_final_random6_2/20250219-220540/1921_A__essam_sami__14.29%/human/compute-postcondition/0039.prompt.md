You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t (1 \le t \le 100) such testcases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` will be equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` will be the last two integers entered by the user, `c` and `d` will be the integers entered in the first input, `e` and `f` will be the integers from the second input split, `g` and `h` will be the integers from the last input split. The variable `n` will be the value of \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - b)\) calculated in the last iteration, and `x` will be the value of \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\) calculated in the last iteration. Depending on whether `x` is greater than `n`, either `n` or `x` will be printed in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It processes t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) test cases, where each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each test case, the function determines if the given coordinates form a valid square and returns a boolean value indicating whether the square is valid or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
