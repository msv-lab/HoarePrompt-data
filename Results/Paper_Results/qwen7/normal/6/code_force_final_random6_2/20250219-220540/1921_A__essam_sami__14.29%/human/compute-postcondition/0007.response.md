Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, `n` is `(a - g) * (a - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)`, `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`**.

In this output state, the variable `x` is assigned the value of `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. All other variables retain their initial values or the values they had before the code was executed.
