Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `g` and `h`. The other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and that `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, along with the specifics about `c` and `d`, are preserved.
