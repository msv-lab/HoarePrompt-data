Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers entered by the user and splits them based on whitespace, converting them to integers and assigning them to `c` and `d` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
