Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `c`, `d`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
