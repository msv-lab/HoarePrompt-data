### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and confirm why the original assessment is correct.

1. **Incorrect Assumption:**
   - The original program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and assumes the smaller distance is the side length squared of the square. This assumption is flawed because the points could be arranged in such a way that the calculated distances do not correspond to the side lengths of the square.

2. **Lack of Verification:**
   - The original program does not verify if the four points form a valid square. It simply compares the distances without ensuring that they form right angles and equal side lengths.

3. **Revised Approach:**
   - The revised approach correctly identifies the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates to determine the side length of the square. This method ensures that the side length is accurately calculated regardless of the order of the points.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly compute the area of the square, and the revised approach is necessary to ensure accuracy.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

This confirms that the original program is incorrect.
