Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the first integer from the input split, `f` is the second integer from the input split, `g` is the first integer from the input split, `h` is the second integer from the input split, `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`**.

This means that the value of `n` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. All other variables retain their initial states.
