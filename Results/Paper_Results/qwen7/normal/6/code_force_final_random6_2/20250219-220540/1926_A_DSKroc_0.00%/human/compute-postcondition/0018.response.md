Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is 1, `bc` is either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the third character of `s`**.

The value of `ac` is incremented by 1, making it 1 since it was initially 0. The values of `t`, `q`, `bc`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
