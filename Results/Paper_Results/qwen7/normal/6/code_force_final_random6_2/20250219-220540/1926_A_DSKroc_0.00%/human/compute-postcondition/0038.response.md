Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 2, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the first character of `s`**.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is still `t-1`, `ac` can be either 1 or 0, `bc` can be either 1 or 2 (it was originally `t-1` which is between 1 and 31, and now it could be incremented to 2 if `i` is not 'A'), `s` remains a non-empty input string, and `i` is the first character of `s`.
