Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` from the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. After each iteration, `i` takes the value of the next character in the string.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: 
   - If `i` is 'A', then `ac` (the count of 'A' characters) is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `bc` (the count of non-'A' characters) is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next character in `s` after the previous iteration, `i` will take the value of the next character in the string `s`.
   - The postcondition for the next iteration will depend on the value of `i`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` will change to the next character in `s`.
   - The counts `ac` and `bc` will either remain the same or increment based on the value of `i`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the counts `ac` and `bc`.

Since the exact values of `i`, `ac`, and `bc` are not provided, we can represent the general state as follows:

- `i` will be the next character in `s`.
- `ac` will either remain the same or increment by 1 if `i` is 'A'.
- `bc` will either remain the same or increment by 1 if `i` is not 'A'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration can be represented as:

**State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is the current count of 'A' characters, `bc` is the current count of non-'A' characters**.
