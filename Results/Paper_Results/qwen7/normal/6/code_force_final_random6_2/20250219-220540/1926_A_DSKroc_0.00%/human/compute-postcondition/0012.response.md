Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 32.
   - `q` is 0.
   - `ac` is either 1 or 0.
   - `bc` is either 1 or 0.
   - `s` is a non-empty input string.
   - `i` is the first character of `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `q` remains 0 because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `ac` and `bc` remain as they were because they are not directly modified in the loop head.
   - `s` remains the same non-empty string because it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `i` will now be the second character of `s` because the loop advances to the next character.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` is still an integer between 1 and 32.
   - `q` is still 0.
   - `ac` is either 1 or 0.
   - `bc` is either 1 or 0.
   - `s` is still a non-empty input string.
   - `i` is now the second character of `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the second character of `s`**
