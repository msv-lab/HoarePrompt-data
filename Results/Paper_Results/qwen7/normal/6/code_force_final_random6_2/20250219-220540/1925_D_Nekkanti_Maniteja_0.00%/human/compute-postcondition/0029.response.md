Output State: **`i` is 100000, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 100000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007**

The code initializes a new variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which evaluates to `1000000007`. This value is assigned to `M`, and it does not affect the values of the existing variables `i`, `k`, `n`, and `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
