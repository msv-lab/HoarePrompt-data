Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: From the given state, `i` is initially set to `100000 + m`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The `range(m)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to `m-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means adjusting the state such that `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is within the range generated by `range(m)`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be within the range generated by `range(m)`, which means `i` should be less than `m`.

Since `i` is initially set to `100000 + m`, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0 and `100000 + m` must be less than `m`, which is impossible unless `m` is greater than 100000. However, since we only need to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we just need `m` to be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + m`, `m` must be greater than 0**
