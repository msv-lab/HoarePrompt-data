Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `100001 + m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `a` + `f`.**

The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by `f`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `a` is its original value plus `f`.
