Output State: **`i` is 100000, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
