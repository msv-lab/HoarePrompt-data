Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the input value used to determine the range of the loop. In this case, the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = int(input()) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 100000.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 100000.
   - `s` is the sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 99999 to 100000.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently 100000, the loop will continue if `int(input()) > 100000`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 100001.
   - `k` must be at least 100001 to allow the loop to run one more time.
   - `s` will be updated to include the new value of the expression for `i = 100001`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 100001, `k` must be greater than or equal to 100001, and `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 99999 to 100001.**
