Output: **(c * 100000 * c * m + c * a) % M**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` starts at 99999 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 100000, making a total of 100000 iterations.
- After these iterations, the value of `i` becomes 100000.
- The variable `k` is at least 100000, ensuring all iterations have been completed.
- The variable `s` is the sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each value of `i` from 99999 to 100000. Since there is only one iteration left (when `i` is 100000), the expression simplifies to `c * 100000 * c * m + c * a`.
- The `% M` operation is applied to this result, meaning the final output is the remainder when `(c * 100000 * c * m + c * a)` is divided by `M`.

Therefore, the print statement outputs the result of `(c * 100000 * c * m + c * a) % M`.
