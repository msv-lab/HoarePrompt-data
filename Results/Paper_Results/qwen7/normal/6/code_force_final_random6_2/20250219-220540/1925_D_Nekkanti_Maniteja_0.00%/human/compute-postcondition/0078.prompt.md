Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 100000, `k` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (which is 100000), and `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 99999 to 100000.

In more detail, after the loop executes all 100000 iterations, the variable `i` will be 100000 because the loop increments `i` starting from 99999. The variable `k` must be at least 100000 to allow the loop to run through all iterations. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each value of `i` from 99999 up to 100000, inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `s` is `k * c * i * c * m + k * c * a`, `i` is `100000 + m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `k` must be at least 1, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `s` will be set to the cumulative sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration, where `i` is `100000 + m` and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 100000. The variable `i` will be `100000 + m` after the last iteration. The variable `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 100000. The variable `k` represents the total number of iterations the loop executed. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` represent the integers obtained from the input split operation during each iteration. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input over the course of the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + 2 * m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `k` is `m`, `s` is `m * c * i * c * m + m * c * a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
