### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not correctly implement the solution. Let's break down why the program is incorrect and what the correct approach should be.

#### Issues with the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not derived from the problem statement. It does not account for the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` does not make sense in the context of the problem. `i` is not defined in the context of the problem, and the term does not represent the expected increase in friendship values.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value for each pair of friends should be calculated based on the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over time.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair `(u, v)` with friendship value `f` over `k` excursions. This can be derived using the formula:
     \[
     E(f) = f \times \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)^k\right)
     \]
   - The sum of these expected values for all pairs of friends should give the final result.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic (`% M`) is correct, but the way it is applied in the given program is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:

1. **Calculate the Modular Inverse:**
   - Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse `c` of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Sum Friendship Values:**
   - Sum the friendship values `f` for all pairs of friends.

3. **Calculate Expected Values:**
   - For each pair `(u, v)` with friendship value `f`, calculate the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions using the formula:
     \[
     E(f) = f \times \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)^k\right)
     \]
   - Sum these expected values.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Ensure all calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the expected sum of friendship values. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic for calculating the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
