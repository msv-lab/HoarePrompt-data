To determine what will be printed, let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Expression Breakdown:**
   \[
   (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4 \times n - 3) + 2 \times n \times (k \ge 4 \times n - 3) + (k == 4 \times n - 2)
   \]

2. **Understanding Variables:**
   - `s` is the next line from the input.
   - `n` is an integer from the first part of `s`.
   - `k` is an integer from the second part of `s`.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - `(k // 2 + k % 2)`: This evaluates to `k` because `k // 2` gives the integer division (floor division) and `k % 2` gives the remainder. Adding these together results in `k`.
   - `(k < 4 * n - 3)`: This is a boolean condition that checks if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`.
   - `(k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This is a boolean condition that checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`.
   - `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This is a boolean condition that checks if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`.

4. **Combining the Conditions:**
   - If `k < 4 * n - 3`, then the expression simplifies to `k` because the second term (`2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`) and the third term (`(k == 4 * n - 2)`) are both zero.
   - If `k >= 4 * n - 3`, then the expression simplifies to `2 * n` because the first term (`(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`) is zero, and the third term is also zero unless `k == 4 * n - 2`.
   - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, then the expression evaluates to `2 * n` because the third term is `1`.

Given this analysis, the expression will evaluate to either `k` (if `k < 4 * n - 3`), `2 * n` (if `k >= 4 * n - 3` but not `4 * n - 2`), or `2 * n` (if `k == 4 * n - 2`).

Therefore, the output will be one of the following based on the value of `k` relative to `4 * n - 3` and `4 * n - 2`:

- If `k < 4 * n - 3`, the output will be `k`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the output will be `2 * n`.
- If `k >= 4 * n - 3` and `k != 4 * n - 2`, the output will be `2 * n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n` and `k`.

Output: **k (if k < 4 * n - 3), 2 * n (if k >= 4 * n - 3 and k != 4 * n - 2), or 2 * n (if k == 4 * n - 2)**
