Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` with specific values at indices 2, 3, and 4, sets `i` to 0, and calculates the cumulative sum of all elements in `a`. Additionally, it updates two auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to maintain certain states during the process. The original list `a` and integer `n` remain unchanged.**
