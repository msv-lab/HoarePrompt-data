Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-2`; `inx` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = i + 1 - inx` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`. Given that `i` was initially `n-1`, after executing the line of code, `i` becomes `n-2`. All other elements in the list `ans` remain unchanged according to the precondition.
