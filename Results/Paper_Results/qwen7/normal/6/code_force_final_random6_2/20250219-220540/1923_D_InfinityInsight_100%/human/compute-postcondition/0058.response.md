Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` is 4 - `inx2`, and `ans[4]` is 1; `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `left[i] - a[i] - 1` to the variable `x`. However, the values of `left`, `a`, and `i` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
