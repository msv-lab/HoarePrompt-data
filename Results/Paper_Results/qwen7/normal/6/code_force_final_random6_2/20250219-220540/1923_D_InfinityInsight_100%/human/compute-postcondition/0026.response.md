Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a`.
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop variable.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`.
   - `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `a` must be a non-empty list.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, the value of `i` will change to the next element in `a`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `a` must still be non-empty and `i` (which is now the current element of `a`) must be within the bounds of `a`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to the next element in `a`.
   - `a` must still be non-empty.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be the next element in `a`.
- `a` must still be non-empty.
- `n` must remain greater than 1.

Since `i` was previously `n`, it will now be the first element of `a` if `a` is non-empty.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `left` remains unchanged.
- `last` remains unchanged.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `i` becomes the first element of `a`.
- `a` must still be non-empty.
- `n` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`; `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1; `i` is the first element of `a`; `a` must be a non-empty list; `n` must be greater than 1**.
