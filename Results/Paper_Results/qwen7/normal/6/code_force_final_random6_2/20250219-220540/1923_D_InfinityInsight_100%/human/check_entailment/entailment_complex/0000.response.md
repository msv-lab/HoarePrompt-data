Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a value in the list `a` plus one.
   - The function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the index efficiently.
   - If the value is not found, it returns -1.
   - If the value is found, it returns the index plus one.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is the core logic of the solution.
   - It maintains three lists: `left`, `last`, and `ans`.
     - `left` stores the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
     - `last` keeps track of the last index where the size changes.
     - `ans` stores the result for each slime.
   - The function iterates through the list `a` to populate these lists.
   - For each slime, it checks if the current slime can eat its left neighbor.
   - If not, it checks if the current slime can eat its right neighbor using the `left` and `last` lists.
   - It updates the `ans` list based on the conditions.

Given the problem statement and the provided comments, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The main steps are:
- Finding the first occurrence of a value in `a` plus one using `func_1`.
- Maintaining cumulative sums and tracking index changes using `func_2`.
- Updating the result list `ans` based on the conditions for each slime.

Since the logic and the steps align with the problem requirements and the provided comments, the overall implementation appears correct.

Correctness: **True**
