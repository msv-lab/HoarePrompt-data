Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The `last` list will contain `-1` repeated until the final index, which will be `n-1`, because each time `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` appends the current index `i`. The `left` list remains unchanged as it only gets updated under specific conditions that are not met here. The `ans` list remains a list of length `n` filled with -1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run through all iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`; `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1; `i` is `n`; `a` must be a non-empty list; `n` must be greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is the first element of `a`, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is the second element of `a`, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
