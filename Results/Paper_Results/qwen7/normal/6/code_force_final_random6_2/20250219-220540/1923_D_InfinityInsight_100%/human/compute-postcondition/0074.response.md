Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-1`; `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `func_1(left, x)` to the variable `inx`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that `inx` will hold whatever value `func_1(left, x)` returns. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
