Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx2` is the value of `last[2]`**

Explanation: The code `inx2 = last[i - 1]` assigns the value of `last[2]` (since `i - 1` equals `3 - 1` which is `2`) to `inx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
