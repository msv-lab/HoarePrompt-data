Output State: **`inx` is equal to `inx2`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `a` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx2` is the value of `last[2]`, and `inx2` is less than `inx`.**

The code `inx = inx2` simply assigns the value of `inx2` to `inx`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
