Postcondition: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1 and -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If the condition `a[i] != a[i - 1]` is true, then `last` is updated to contain -1, -1, and 3, making `i` equal to 4. However, if the condition is false, `last` remains as [-1, -1], and `i` is still set to 4. In both cases, `left` and `ans` remain unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than 1.
