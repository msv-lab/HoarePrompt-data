Output State: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The `last` list will contain `-1` repeated until the final index, which will be `n-1`, because each time `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` appends the current index `i`. The `left` list remains unchanged as it only gets updated under specific conditions that are not met here. The `ans` list remains a list of length `n` filled with -1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run through all iterations.
