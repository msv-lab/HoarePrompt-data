Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not explicitly given an initial value in the loop head, but it starts from 1 (inclusive) as per the `range(1, n)` function.
   - `n` is a parameter used in the `range` function, and its value is not provided directly in the loop head.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will start executing when `i` is 1 and continue until `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 initially.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is a list containing 0, `last` is a list containing -1, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
