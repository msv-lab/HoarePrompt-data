Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `i` is 3, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(left, x)` to the variable `inx`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `inx`, but we know it is the result of calling `func_1` with `left` and `x` as arguments. All other variables retain their initial states.
