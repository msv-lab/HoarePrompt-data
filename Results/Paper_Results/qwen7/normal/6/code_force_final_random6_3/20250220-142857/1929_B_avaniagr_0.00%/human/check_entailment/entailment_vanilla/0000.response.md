Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`. This reads all lines except the first one.
   - Each line is split into `n` and `k` using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Logic Breakdown**:
   - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.
   - The term `(k < 4 * n - 3)` checks if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`.
   - The term `(k >= 4 * n - 3)` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`.
   - The term `(k == 4 * n - 2)` checks if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`.

3. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - If `k < 4 * n - 3`, it returns `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`, which simplifies to the number of cells needed to satisfy the condition for `k < 4 * n - 3`.
   - If `k >= 4 * n - 3`, it returns `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`, which ensures that all diagonals are covered.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**:
  - For small values of `k`, we need to color enough cells such that at least `k` diagonals are covered.
  - The formula `(k // 2 + k % 2)` ensures that we cover the required diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

- **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**:
  - When `k` is large enough, we need to ensure that all diagonals are covered.
  - The formula `2 * n` ensures that all diagonals are covered because each row and column will have at least one colored cell.
  - The additional check `(k == 4 * n - 2)` ensures that if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, we still return the correct number of cells.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)
   - All 4 diagonals need to be covered.
   - Minimum cells required: 2 (one from each pair of opposite diagonals).

2. **Example 2**: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)
   - At least 3 diagonals need to be covered.
   - Minimum cells required: 2 (one from each pair of opposite diagonals).

3. **Example 3**: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)
   - All 10 diagonals need to be covered.
   - Minimum cells required: 6 (each row and column must have at least one cell).

4. **Example 4**: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)
   - At least 9 diagonals need to be covered.
   - Minimum cells required: 5 (one extra cell to cover the remaining diagonal).

5. **Example 5**: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)
   - At least 7 diagonals need to be covered.
   - Minimum cells required: 4 (each row and column must have at least one cell).

6. **Example 6**: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)
   - At least 11 diagonals need to be covered.
   - Minimum cells required: 6 (each row and column must have at least one cell).

7. **Example 7**: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)
   - At least 3 diagonals need to be covered.
   - Minimum cells required: 2 (one from each pair of opposite diagonals).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells required to cover the specified number of diagonals. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
