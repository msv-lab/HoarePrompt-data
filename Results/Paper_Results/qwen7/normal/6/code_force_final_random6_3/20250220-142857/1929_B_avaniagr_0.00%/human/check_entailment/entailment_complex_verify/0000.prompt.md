You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more lines of input left in the file. For each line, `s` will be the line of input, `n` will be the first integer split from `s`, and `k` will be the second integer split from `s`. After all iterations, the final output will consist of the results of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` evaluated for each line of input.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the output will include the result of the given expression for every line of input provided, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple lines of input, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each line, it evaluates and prints the result of the expression \((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)\). The function reads inputs from standard input until no more lines are available, then outputs the computed values for each line of input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the minimum number of cells to color does not always yield the correct result.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:
- For \( k < 4n - 3 \), the program calculates \((k // 2 + k \% 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)\).
- For \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the program calculates \(2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)\).

This logic seems to attempt to cover different ranges of \( k \), but it does not correctly handle all edge cases and scenarios. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)

According to the problem statement, a \( 3 \times 3 \) grid has \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals. To ensure that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to color at least 6 cells (as shown in the example figure). However, the program incorrectly calculates this as:
\[ 2 * 3 * (10 >= 10 - 2) + (10 == 10 - 2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \]

This is correct, but consider another case:
- Input: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)

Here, the program should also correctly calculate the minimum number of cells needed, but it uses the formula for \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), which is:
\[ 2 * 3 * (9 >= 10 - 2) + (9 == 10 - 2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \]

However, the correct answer should be 5, as shown in the example figures. This indicates that the program does not handle the transition between ranges correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the correct minimum number of cells needed to color for all values of \( k \).
