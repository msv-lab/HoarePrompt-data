Output State: **`s` is the first line of input after skipping the first line, `n` is an integer equal to the first split value of `s`, and `k` is an integer equal to the second split value of `s`.**

This means that the string `s` remains unchanged, but it is now known that `n` and `k` are integers obtained by splitting `s` on spaces and converting the resulting strings to integers.
