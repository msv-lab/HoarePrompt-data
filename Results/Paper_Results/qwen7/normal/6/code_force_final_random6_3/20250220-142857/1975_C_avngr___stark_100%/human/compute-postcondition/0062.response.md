`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `t` remains 1, `a` remains unchanged, `max` remains the maximum value of the second largest element in any consecutive subarray of length 3 within `a`, `i` remains `n-1`, and `temp` remains a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n-4` and ending at index `n-1`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 is maintained.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the maximum value of the second largest element in any consecutive subarray of length 3 within `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` starting from index `n-4` and ending at index `n-1`.**
