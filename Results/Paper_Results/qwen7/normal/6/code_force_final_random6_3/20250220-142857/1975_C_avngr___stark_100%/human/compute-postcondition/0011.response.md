Output State: **`max` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` and containing the next two elements.**

Explanation: The code `temp = a[i:i + 3]` creates a sublist `temp` from the list `a` starting at index `i` and containing the next two elements (i.e., indices `i+1` and `i+2`). The values of `max`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
