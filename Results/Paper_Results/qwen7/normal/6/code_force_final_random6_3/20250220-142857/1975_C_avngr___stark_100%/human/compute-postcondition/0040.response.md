State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, and `i` is 1**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(n - 2)` will execute as long as `n - 2 > 0`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.
3. **Initial Values**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` is 0.
   - `i` is initially set to 0 by the `range` function.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the first iteration will start with `i = 1` (as `range(n - 2)` will iterate over values starting from 1 up to `n - 3`).
   - Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to `1` for the loop to start its first iteration.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at all.

Thus, the required adjustments are:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is adjusted to 1.
- The other variables (`t`, `a`, `max`) remain as they are because they are not directly involved in the loop condition.
