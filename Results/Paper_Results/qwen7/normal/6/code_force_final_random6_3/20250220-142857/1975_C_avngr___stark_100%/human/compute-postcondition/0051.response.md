Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 5, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is still equal to `temp[1]`, and `i` is 4. `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 4 and ending at index 6, and `temp` is sorted.**
