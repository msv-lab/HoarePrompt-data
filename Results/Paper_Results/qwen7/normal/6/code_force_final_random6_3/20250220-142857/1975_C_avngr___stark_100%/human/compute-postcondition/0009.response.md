Output State: **`max` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `max = 0` initializes the variable `max` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
