Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop variable `_` is typically an index or a counter that increments with each iteration. However, since `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop body, its initial value is not critical for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `t` is crucial because the loop will run `t` times. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the given range.

Given this analysis, the state adjustments needed are:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
