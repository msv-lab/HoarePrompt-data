Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is now equal to `temp[1]` which is greater than the previous `max`, and `i` is 3; `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 3, and `temp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `max = temp[1]` updates the value of `max` to the second element of the list `temp`. Since `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 3, and assuming `a` is already sorted, the second element of `temp` (which is `temp[1]`) is now assigned to `max`. The length of `temp` is 3, so after updating `max`, the index `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
