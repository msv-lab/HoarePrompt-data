Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `-1`, `temp` is an empty list, and `max` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = n - 3` down to `i = 0`), the variable `i` will eventually become less than 0, making the condition `i < n - 2` false, which terminates the loop. At this point, `i` will be `-1`. The variable `temp` is a sorted sublist of three consecutive elements from the list `a`, and it is updated in each iteration but becomes an empty list when `i` goes out of bounds. Since the loop does not modify `max` unless it finds a new second-largest element in any of the sublists, `max` remains unchanged from its initial value of 0.
