Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `n` is still 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, the values of `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.
