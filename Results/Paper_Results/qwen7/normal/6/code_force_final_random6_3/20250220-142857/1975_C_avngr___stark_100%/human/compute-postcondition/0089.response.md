Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `-1`
- `temp` is an empty list
- `max` remains unchanged (though the value of `max` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, it is not modified in the code snippet, so we assume it retains its previous value)

The code snippet only contains a single line:

```python
print(max)
```

Since `max` is not modified in the code and its value is not specified in the initial state other than it "remains unchanged," we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `max` as it was before the code was executed.

Output: **max (where max is the unchanged value before the code execution)**
