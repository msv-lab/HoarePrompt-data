Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `t` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0, and `i` is 2; `temp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 3, and `temp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `temp.sort()` sorts the sublist `temp` which is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 and ending at index 3. Since the exact values of the elements in `temp` are not specified, we know that after sorting, `temp` will contain the smallest three elements from the original sublist in ascending order. However, without knowing the exact values, we cannot specify the exact values of `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged.
