Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `max` is `temp[1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `temp[1]` to `max`. This means that `max` now holds the second element of the sorted sublist `temp`, which was originally a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`. The value of `i` and the state of `temp` remain unchanged.
