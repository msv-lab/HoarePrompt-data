You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (consisting only of '0's and '1's) and its length is at least 2.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for every occurrence of '0' following one or more '1's in the list `s`, plus any individual '1's encountered. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `s`, and `n` will be the count of '1's in the list `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `ans` will be the total count of segments where there are one or more '1's followed by a '0', plus one additional count for each standalone '1'. The variable `i` will reflect the total number of elements processed in the list `s`, and `n` will give the total number of '1's found in the list `s`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 8

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a binary string s is provided where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s consists only of '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The value of `t` must remain greater than 0 after all the iterations of the loop have finished. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and there are no operations within the loop that modify the value of `t`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a list of integers from input, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This means `func_1` is not correctly reading the input as a binary string.
   - It then iterates through the list, counting the number of 1s (`n`) until it encounters a 0. If a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`). This logic does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the segments of 1s and 0s in the string and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all 1s to the front.
   - For each segment of 0s, we need to consider the cost of shifting the segment of 1s that precede it to the end of the segment of 0s.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
