The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is provided, where the length of `s` is between 2 and 200,000 characters, and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process `t` test cases, where each test case involves a binary string `s`, but no specific return value is defined for the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes a binary string `s`. No explicit return value is defined.**
