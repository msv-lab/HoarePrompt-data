### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a list of integers from input, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This means `func_1` is not correctly reading the input as a binary string.
   - It then iterates through the list, counting the number of 1s (`n`) until it encounters a 0. If a 0 is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`). This logic does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - The function `func_1` assumes that the input is a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. This mismatch in data types makes the function invalid for the given problem.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is not correctly implemented, `func_2` also fails to provide the correct solution.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the segments of 1s and 0s in the string and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all 1s to the front.
   - For each segment of 0s, we need to consider the cost of shifting the segment of 1s that precede it to the end of the segment of 0s.

5. **Evaluating the Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_1` is incorrectly processing the input as a list of integers instead of a binary string. This is evident from the line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))`, which splits the input and converts it to a list of integers.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting the binary string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it simply counts the number of 1s followed by a 0 and adds `n + 1` to the answer, which is not the correct approach.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle the binary string input and the logic inside the function does not correctly compute the minimum cost, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly read the binary string input and the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting the binary string using cyclic shifts.
