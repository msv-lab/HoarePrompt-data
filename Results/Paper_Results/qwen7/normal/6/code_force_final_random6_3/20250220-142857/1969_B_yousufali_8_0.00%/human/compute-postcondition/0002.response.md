Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (assuming `func_1()` does not modify `t`), the value of `t` remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
