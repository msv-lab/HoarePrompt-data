Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle a different problem, which is counting the number of 1s in a binary list and adding the position of the first 0 after each 1. This approach does not address the requirement of finding the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted using cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string "101011":
- The program would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5, but the correct minimum cost is 9, as explained in the problem statement.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: "101011"
- Expected output: 9
- Program output: 5

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
