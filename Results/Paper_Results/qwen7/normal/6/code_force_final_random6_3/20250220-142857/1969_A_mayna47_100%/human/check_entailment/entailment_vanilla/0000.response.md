Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is incorrect because the function should be called within the loop to process each test case.

3. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros.
   - It then updates this list with the input values, effectively creating a mapping from index `i` to `p_i`.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[i])` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that only two invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that three invitations are needed.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1()` is not being called for each test case. Instead, `func_1()` is defined but never invoked in the main loop. This means the program will not process any test cases.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations:**
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The current implementation assumes that finding a single pair `(i, v[i])` where `v[v[i]] == i` is sufficient to ensure at least two friends come to the party. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the input `[2, 1]` where `n = 2`. Here, the program would incorrectly print `2` when it should print `2` as well, but the logic needs to handle more complex scenarios.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check for pairs (i, v[i]) where v[v[i]] == i
    found_pair = False
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            found_pair = True
            break
    
    if found_pair:
        print(2)
    else:
        print(3)
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect due to the missing function call and flawed logic. Therefore, the corrected program is necessary.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
