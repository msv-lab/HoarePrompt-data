Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1` is called without parameters**: In the main loop, `func_1()` is called without any arguments, but `func_1` expects no arguments, which is fine. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not fully address the problem requirements.

2. **Logic for determining the minimum number of invitations**: The logic in `func_1` only checks for a specific condition where `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition is true only when the friend `i` and their best friend `v[i]` are each other's best friends. However, this is not the only scenario where we can invite just 2 friends. For example, consider the case where there is a cycle of length 3 or more, and inviting just 2 friends from this cycle might not be sufficient.

3. **Handling cycles and chains**: The solution needs to handle cases where there are cycles or chains of friends. If there is a cycle of length 3 or more, inviting just 2 friends might not be enough. For instance, in the case `[3, 1, 4, 2]`, inviting friends 1 and 4 would not work because friend 1's best friend 3 and friend 4's best friend 2 do not have invitations.

4. **Minimum number of invitations**: The program should check for cycles and chains and ensure that at least 2 friends are invited. The correct approach involves identifying cycles and ensuring that at least one friend from each cycle is invited, possibly along with some additional friends to meet the requirement of having at least 2 friends at the party.

To fix this, the program needs to properly identify cycles and chains and ensure that the minimum number of invitations is calculated correctly.
