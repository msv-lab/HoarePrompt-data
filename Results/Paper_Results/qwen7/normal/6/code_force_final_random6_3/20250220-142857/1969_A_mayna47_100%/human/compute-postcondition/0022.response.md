Functionality: **The function reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `v`. It then checks if for any index `i` from 1 to `n`, the value at `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and exits. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.**
