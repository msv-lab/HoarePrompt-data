Output State: **i is 50, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and v[v[50]] is not equal to 50.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` from 1 to 50 (since the upper limit of `n` is 50). For each value of `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. If this condition is true for any `i`, the function prints 2 and returns immediately. However, based on the given information, the condition `v[v[i]] == i` is false for all `i` from 1 to 3, and there's no indication that it becomes true for any `i` up to 50. Therefore, the loop completes all 50 iterations without returning, and the final state has `i` set to 50. The values of `n` and the condition `v[v[50]] != 50` are maintained as per the last iteration's check.
