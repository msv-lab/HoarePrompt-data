Output: **2**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the value of `i` as 3 and mentions that `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer 2, so the output is exactly as stated.
