Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1 (so now `i` is 1), and `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[0]` to its current value. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
