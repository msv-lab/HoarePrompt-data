Output State: **`i` is 0, `ans` is 'a[0] ', `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` to `ans`. Since `i` is 0, it tries to access `a[0]`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `a`, so `a[0]` remains unspecified. The value of `i` is not changed, and `bets` remains greater than 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.
