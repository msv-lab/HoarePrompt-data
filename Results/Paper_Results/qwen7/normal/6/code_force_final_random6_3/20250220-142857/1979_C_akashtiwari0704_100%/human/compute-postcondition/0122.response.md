Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * (bets - 1)`, `ans` is the concatenation of `'a[i] '` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `bets` must be the final value it was set to after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to twice the final value of `bets` minus 2. The variable `ans` will contain a space-separated string of all elements `a[i]` for every `i` from `0` to the final value of `bets-1`. The value of `bets` must be the last value it was set to during the loop's execution.
