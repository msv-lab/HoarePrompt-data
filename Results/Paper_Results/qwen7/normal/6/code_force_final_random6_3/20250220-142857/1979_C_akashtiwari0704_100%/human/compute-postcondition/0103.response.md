Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the variable `bets`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is either `N` or `2 * N`.
   - `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`.
   - `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either `N` or `2 * N`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts from 0).
   - For the loop to execute again, `bets` must remain greater than 0.
   - The values of `sumo` and `a[i]` are not directly affected by the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

5. **Determine the New Values**:
   - If `i` was `N`, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `N + 1`.
   - If `i` was `2 * N`, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `2 * N + 1`.

Given these points, let's summarize the new states:

- If `i` was `N`, then `i` becomes `N + 1`.
- If `i` was `2 * N`, then `i` becomes `2 * N + 1`.
- `bets` remains greater than 0.
- `sumo` and `a[i]` are not adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Since we don't know the exact value of `N`, we'll consider both cases:

**Case 1**: If `i` was `N`:
- `i` is now `N + 1`.
- `bets` must still be greater than 0.

**Case 2**: If `i` was `2 * N`:
- `i` is now `2 * N + 1`.
- `bets` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `i` is either `N + 1` or `2 * N + 1`; `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`; `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**
