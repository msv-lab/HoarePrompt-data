Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans` is 'a[0] '**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is 0) to `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `ans` is initialized to an empty string plus the string representation of `a[0]`.
