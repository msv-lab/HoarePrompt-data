Postcondition: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is the last index processed (i.e., `bets - 1`). If `sumo >= prod`, then `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` after being used in the calculation of `sumo`. Otherwise, `i` is equal to twice the final value of `bets` minus 2, `ans` is the concatenation of `'a[i] '` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `bets` is the final value it was set to after all iterations.**
