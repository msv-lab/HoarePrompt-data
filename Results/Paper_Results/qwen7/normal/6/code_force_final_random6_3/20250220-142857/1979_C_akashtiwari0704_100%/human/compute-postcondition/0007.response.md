Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the current iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - `l` must still have at least 1 element.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of the list `l`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` will be 1 in the next iteration, we need to set `i` to 1.
   - The value of `g` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because the update happens inside the loop, and we are looking at the state before the update for the next iteration.
   - The list `l` must still have at least 1 element, as stated in the problem.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`g` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `l` must still have at least 1 element**.
