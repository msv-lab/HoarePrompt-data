Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is 'a[0]'
   - `bets` must be greater than 0

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < bets` is satisfied as long as `bets` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 1.
   - `bets` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `ans` remains 'a[0]' because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `bets` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is 'a[0]', `bets` must be greater than 0**
