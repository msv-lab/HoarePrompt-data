Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `i` is 0, `l` must have at least 1 element.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to its current value multiplied by the first element of list `l` (i.e., `l[0]`), and then the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[0]` is taken. The value of `i` remains 0 as no change was made to it. The precondition that `l` must have at least one element is still valid.
