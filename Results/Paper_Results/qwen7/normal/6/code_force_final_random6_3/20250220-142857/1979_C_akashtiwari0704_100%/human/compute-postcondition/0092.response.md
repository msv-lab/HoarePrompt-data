Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `g` will be the product of all elements in the list `l` (each element divided by its greatest common divisor with `g`), `i` will be equal to the length of `l`, `l` is a non-empty list.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the value obtained by multiplying all elements of the list `l` together, where each multiplication step divides the current `g` by its greatest common divisor with the current list element. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`, indicating that all elements in the list have been processed. The list `l` remains unchanged and is assumed to be non-empty.
