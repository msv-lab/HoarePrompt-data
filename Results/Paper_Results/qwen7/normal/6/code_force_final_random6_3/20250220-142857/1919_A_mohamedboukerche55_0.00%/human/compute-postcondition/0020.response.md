Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables a and b within the range 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, where a and b are positive integers, and t (a positive integer) is constrained such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. It returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters `a`, `b`, and `t` through its internal processing, with `a` and `b` being positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) and `t` being a positive integer not exceeding 1000. The exact nature of the return value is not specified here, but it is implied to be derived from the given constraints on `a`, `b`, and `t`.
