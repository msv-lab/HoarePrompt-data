Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `s` is an input string
   - `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`
   - `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. 

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged because the input is taken once before the loop starts and is used as the upper limit for the range.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `s`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s`**
