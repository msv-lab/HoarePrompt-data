You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases minus one (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration), `s` will be the last input string received, `a` will be the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, and `b` will be the second integer from the split string representation of `s`.
    #
    #This means that `i` represents the index of the last iteration, `s` contains the most recent input string provided by the user, and `a` and `b` are the respective first and second integers from that last input string.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: 'bob  '
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is the index of the last iteration, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, and `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum is considered even; if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the sum is considered odd.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets. They can also choose to swap wallets. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - If both players play optimally, the key observation is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can remove a coin from the other wallet). This ensures Bob can always make a move after Alice.
   - If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice wins because she can force the sum to become even on her turn, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with no valid moves.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into two parts and converts them to integers `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Bug Identification**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the input splitting and conversion. Instead of splitting the input string properly, it attempts to split using `split()` and then convert the first element to an integer.
   - This approach fails when the input format is not strictly followed (e.g., spaces between numbers).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct way to read the input should be to directly split the input string into two parts and convert them to integers.
   - The logic to check the parity of the sum and print the winner is correct.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect due to the improper handling of input splitting and conversion. Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the solution.

### Correctness:
**False**
