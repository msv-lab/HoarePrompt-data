Postcondition: `i` is the index of the last iteration, `s` is the last input string received, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, and `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum is considered even; if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the sum is considered odd.
