Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `s` is an input string
   - `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`
   - `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s` after the operation
   - `s` is updated to the new input string

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged because it is determined by the user input before the loop starts.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `s` will remain the updated input string.
   - `a` and `b` will be updated based on the new input string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `s` is the updated input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string representation of `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string representation of `s` after the operation**
