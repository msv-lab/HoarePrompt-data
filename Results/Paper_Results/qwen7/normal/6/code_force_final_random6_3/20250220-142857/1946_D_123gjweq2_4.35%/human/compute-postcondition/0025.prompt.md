Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur_arr` is a list of integers representing a segment of the input array a, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and `x` is an integer representing the favorite number x from the problem description; `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0; `thing1` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur_arr` must contain at least one element, `xor` is the result of XORing each element in `cur_arr` with the current value of `xor`. If the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur_arr` must contain at least one element; `xor` is now 0; `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus the value of 0, and `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements. If `xor` shifted right by `bit` and bitwise AND with 1 equals 0 (i.e., the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0), then `xor` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `xor` remains unchanged as well since there is no else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
