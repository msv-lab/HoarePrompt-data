Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cur_arr:`. The objects involved here are `i`, `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `cur_arr` is a list of integers representing a segment of the input array `a`.
   - `i` is the variable that will take on each value from `cur_arr` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `cur_arr`. Once `cur_arr` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take on each value from `cur_arr`, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value. However, we need to ensure that `cur_arr` is not empty for the loop to start executing.
   - Therefore, the state of `cur_arr` must be such that it contains at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `cur_arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element**
