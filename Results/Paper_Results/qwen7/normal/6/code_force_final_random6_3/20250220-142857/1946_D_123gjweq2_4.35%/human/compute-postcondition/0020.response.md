Output State: **`xor` is the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`, `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus 0, `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing an XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the current element `i` from `cur_arr`. Since `cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `xor` will be updated accordingly. The value of `new_arr` remains unchanged as it was already defined to contain the previous elements plus 0.
