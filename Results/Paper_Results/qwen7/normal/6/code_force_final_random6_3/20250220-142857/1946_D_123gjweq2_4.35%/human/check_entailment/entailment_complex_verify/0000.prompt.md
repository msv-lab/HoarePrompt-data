You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr, k))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers, and x is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30.
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, 31)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list 'arr' considering 31 bits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and an integer `x` where 0 ≤ x < 2^30. It returns the maximum value in the list `arr` considering 31 bits.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of integers representing a segment of the input array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and x is an integer representing the favorite number x from the problem description.

    #State: cur_arr is a list of integers representing a segment of the input array a, bit is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and x is an integer representing the favorite number x from the problem description. The value of bit is not equal to -1

            xor = 0
        
    #State: Postcondition: `cur_arr` must be empty, `xor` is the result of XORing all elements in the original `cur_arr`, and `new_arr` contains all the elements that satisfied the condition (i.e., their `bit`-th bit is 0) in the order they were encountered.

If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1, `new_arr` contains elements whose `bit`-th bit is 1, and `thing1` is the maximum element in `new_arr` based on the `bit`-th bit. If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, `new_arr` contains elements whose `bit`-th bit is 0, and `thing1` is -1.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :

    else :
        return thing1
        #The program returns `thing1`, which is the maximum element in `new_arr` if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, otherwise it returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of integers, and `bit`, an integer representing the current bit position. It processes the list `cur_arr` by iterating through its elements and performing bitwise operations to determine subsets of elements based on the `bit`-th bit. Depending on the conditions checked during the process, the function either returns the length of the list `cur_arr`, the maximum value between the maximum element found in a derived list `new_arr` and the length of `new_arr`, or the maximum element in `new_arr` if certain bit conditions are met, otherwise it returns -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `find_max` does not properly handle the bitwise operations and the conditions specified in the problem description.

The function `find_max` attempts to split the array into subarrays based on the current bit being processed. However, it does not correctly compute the XOR of the subarrays and check the bitwise OR condition. Instead, it appends the XOR value to a new array when the current bit is zero, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of valid segments.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
n = 4
x = 3
arr = [1, 2, 3, 0]
```

According to the problem description, we need to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of their XOR results is less than or equal to `x`.

The correct solution would be:
- Segment 1: [1, 1] -> XOR = 1
- Segment 2: [2, 4] -> XOR = 2 (since 2 ⊕ 3 ⊕ 0 = 2)
- (1) | (2) = 3, which is equal to `x`.

Thus, the correct output should be `2`.

However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly and would likely return a different result, indicating that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
