Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cur_arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `cur_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `cur_arr` contains at least one element.

3. **Analyze the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.
   - `xor` is now 0.
   - `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus 0.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `cur_arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and assuming the loop body processes one element from `cur_arr` per iteration, the first element of `cur_arr` (denoted by `i`) will be consumed in the loop body.
   - After processing the first element, `cur_arr` will no longer contain that element, reducing its size by one.
   - For the loop to execute again, `cur_arr` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the first element of `cur_arr`.
   - `cur_arr` will be reduced by one element, meaning it will contain at least one less element than before.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least two elements, `xor` is now 0, `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus 0**.
