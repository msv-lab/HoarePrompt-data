Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( k \) of non-overlapping segments in an array such that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XORs of these segments is less than or equal to \( x \).
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code attempts to solve this problem using a recursive approach, considering each bit position from 31 down to 0.
   - The `func_1` function calls `find_max` with the entire array and the highest bit position (31).
   - The `find_max` function recursively splits the array into segments based on the current bit position, ensuring that the bitwise OR of the XORs of these segments is within the limit \( x \).

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `find_max` function correctly handles the base case where `bit` is -1, returning the length of the current segment.
   - The function splits the array into two parts based on whether the current bit is set in the XOR of the segment. This ensures that the bitwise OR condition is maintained.
   - The recursion correctly handles the case where the current bit is set in the XOR of the segment, leading to a segment where the bit is set, and the remaining part where the bit is unset.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where no valid segments can be formed, returning -1.
   - The code correctly handles the case where the entire array forms a valid segment.

5. **Output**:
   - The code outputs the maximum number of segments \( k \) that satisfy the conditions, or -1 if no such segments exist.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
