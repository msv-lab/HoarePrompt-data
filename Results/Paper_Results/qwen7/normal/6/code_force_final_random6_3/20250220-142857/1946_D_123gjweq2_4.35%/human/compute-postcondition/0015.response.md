Output State: **`cur_arr` must contain at least one element; `xor` is now `xor ^ i`; `new_arr` contains the previous elements plus `xor`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `xor` to `new_arr`. Since `cur_arr` must contain at least one element and `xor` is updated as `xor ^ i` (where `i` is the current element in `cur_arr`), the new value of `xor` is included in `new_arr`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
