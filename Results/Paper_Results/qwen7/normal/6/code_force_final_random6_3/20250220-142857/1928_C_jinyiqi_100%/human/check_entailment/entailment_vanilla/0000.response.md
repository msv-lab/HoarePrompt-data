Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.
   - This function is used twice in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`

4. **Condition 1: `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`**
   - If this condition is true, it means `n + x - 2` is even.
   - The program then calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` to get all divisors.
   - It iterates over these divisors and checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are met, the value `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the `output` list.

5. **Condition 2: `(n - x) % 2 == 0`**
   - If this condition is true, it means `n - x` is even.
   - The program then calls `func_1(n - x)` to get all divisors.
   - It iterates over these divisors and checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are met, the value `(s + 2) / 2` is added to the `output` list.

6. **Removing Duplicates and Counting:**
   - The program converts the `output` list to a set to remove duplicates.
   - It then prints the length of the set, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Divisor Calculation:**
  - The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of a given number.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensure that the settling pattern length `2k - 2` is even, which is necessary for the settling to work.

- **Divisor Filtering:**
  - The filtering conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` correctly identify valid `k` values.

- **Duplicate Removal and Counting:**
  - Using a set to remove duplicates and then counting the elements ensures that we get the unique number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
