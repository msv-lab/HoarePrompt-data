Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\); `i` is 6; `n` is `x`; `output1` is a list containing the integer 5; `output2` is a list containing the integer `x / 6`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `x / i` (which is `x / 6`) to `output2`. Given that `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\) and `i` is 6, `x / 6` is calculated and added to `output2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
