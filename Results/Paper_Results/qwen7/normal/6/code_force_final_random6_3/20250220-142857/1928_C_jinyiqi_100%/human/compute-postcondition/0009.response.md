Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `n` is `int(x)`**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 3) to `output1`. However, since `output1` is not defined in the initial state and is not relevant to the variables `x`, `i`, and `n`, we only focus on the changes made to these variables. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still equal to `int(x)`. The value of `x` also remains unchanged.
