Output State: **`output1` is reversed, `output2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1`. This means that the order of elements in `output1` is flipped, but the contents of `output2` remain unchanged. The initial conditions and the relationship between `output1` and `output2` (where `output2` contains the corresponding quotients for each divisor in `output1`) are preserved.
