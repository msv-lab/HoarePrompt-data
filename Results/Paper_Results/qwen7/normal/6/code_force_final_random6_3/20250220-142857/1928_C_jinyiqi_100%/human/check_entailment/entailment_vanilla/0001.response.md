### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received.
   - It checks two conditions using `func_1` to find potential values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \), including both the divisors and their complements.
   - The function is used to find potential values of \( k \) from the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The code checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even.
   - If they are even, it uses the divisors found by `func_1` to check if they satisfy the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

6. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for finding divisors and checking the conditions seems correct.
   - The handling of duplicates by converting to a set is appropriate.
   - The conditions for \( k \) are correctly derived from the divisors.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of possible values of \( k \) that fit the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
