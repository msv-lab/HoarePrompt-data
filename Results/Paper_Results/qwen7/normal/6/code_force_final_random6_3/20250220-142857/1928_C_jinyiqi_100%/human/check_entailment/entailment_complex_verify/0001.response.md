### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received.
   - It checks two conditions using `func_1` to find potential values of \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \), including both the divisors and their complements.
   - The function is used to find potential values of \( k \) from the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The code checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even.
   - If they are even, it uses the divisors found by `func_1` to check if they satisfy the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

6. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for finding divisors and checking the conditions seems correct.
   - The handling of duplicates by converting to a set is appropriate.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of how `func_1` is used to determine the possible values of \( k \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1(x)`**:
  - The function `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \), but it does not directly help in determining the values of \( k \). Instead, it should be used to find the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) and then check if those divisors correspond to valid \( k \) values.
  - Specifically, the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) should be checked to see if they fit the pattern of \( k \) values.

- **Checking Conditions**:
  - The condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \) is used to filter out invalid \( k \) values, but it is applied incorrectly. The correct condition should be \( s \geq 2x - 2 \) because \( k \) must be at least \( 2x - 2 \) to ensure \( x \) is within the range of the settling pattern.

### Corrected Logic:

- The correct approach would be to:
  - Find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
  - Filter those divisors to find valid \( k \) values where \( s \geq 2x - 2 \).
  - Ensure that the divisors are within the range \( 2 \leq k \leq n \).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the logic for determining valid \( k \) values is flawed. The function `func_1` is not used correctly to derive the valid \( k \) values, and the filtering condition is also incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
