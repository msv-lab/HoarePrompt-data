Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 2, `output1` is a list containing the integer 2, `output2` is a list containing the integer `int(x / i)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Given that `i` is 2, the value appended to `output2` is `int(x / 2)`. The initial values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged, and `output1` contains the integer 2.
