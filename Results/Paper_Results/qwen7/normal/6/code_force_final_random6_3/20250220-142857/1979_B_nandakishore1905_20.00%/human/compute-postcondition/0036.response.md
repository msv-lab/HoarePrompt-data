Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain as they were before the if-else block.**
