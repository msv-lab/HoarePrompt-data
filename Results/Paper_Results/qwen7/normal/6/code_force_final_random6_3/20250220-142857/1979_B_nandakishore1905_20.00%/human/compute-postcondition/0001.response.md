Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`.**

Explanation: The code splits the input (which is the value of `t`) into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since `t` is a single integer, `input().split()` treats it as a single space-separated value, resulting in `n` and `m` being assigned the same value as `t`. However, since the problem specifies that `input().split()` is used, we assume it splits the input into two parts, even if they are the same. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and `n` and `m` are assigned the respective split values, which in this case are the same as `t`.
