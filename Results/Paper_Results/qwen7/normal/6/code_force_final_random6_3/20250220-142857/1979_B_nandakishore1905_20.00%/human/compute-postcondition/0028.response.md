Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to be the previous value of `i` plus 1, but since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, it is described as "the previous value of `i` plus 1".
