Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`, which is expected to be equal to `t`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value that matches `t`.
   - Therefore, the input to `int(input())` must be `t`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- The input to `int(input())` must be `t`.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input to `int(input())` must be `t`**.
