Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
