Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1)**.

This means that the variable `q` is assigned the value of \(2^{(p-1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
