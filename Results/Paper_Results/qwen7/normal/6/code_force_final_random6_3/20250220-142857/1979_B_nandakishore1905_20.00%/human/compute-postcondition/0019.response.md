Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, and `m` is the second integer input split from `t`; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `q` as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
