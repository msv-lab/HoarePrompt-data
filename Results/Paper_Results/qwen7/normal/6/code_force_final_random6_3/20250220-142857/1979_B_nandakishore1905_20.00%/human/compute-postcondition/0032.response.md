Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation using the `bin()` function and removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. This results in a new variable `l` holding the binary string representation of `k`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
