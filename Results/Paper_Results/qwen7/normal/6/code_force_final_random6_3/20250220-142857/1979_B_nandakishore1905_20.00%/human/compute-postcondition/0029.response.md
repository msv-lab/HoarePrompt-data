Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from `t`.
- `m` is the second integer input split from `t`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, i.e., \(k = |n - m|\).
- `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, but this variable `i` is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
