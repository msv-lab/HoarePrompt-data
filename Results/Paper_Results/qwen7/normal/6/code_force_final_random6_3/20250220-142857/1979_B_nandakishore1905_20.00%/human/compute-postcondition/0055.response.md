Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m` (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. Based on the value of `k`, it prints one of the following:
- If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2, and `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1.
- If `k` is not a power of 2, and `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2.
- Otherwise, it calculates `q` as \(2^{(p - 1)}\) where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, and prints `k - q`.

After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final output consists of `t` printed values corresponding to each test case.**
