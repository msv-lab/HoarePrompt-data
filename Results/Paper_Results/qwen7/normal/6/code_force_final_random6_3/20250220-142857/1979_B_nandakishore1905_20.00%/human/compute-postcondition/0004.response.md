Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input split from `t`.
- `m` is the second integer input split from `t`.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is a power of 2.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and is a power of 2.

Since the specific values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we know only that their absolute difference (`k`) is a power of 2. Therefore, the output will be a power of 2.

Output: **a power of 2 (where the specific value depends on the inputs n and m)**
