You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is the initial positive integer input. For each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the following process occurs:
    #
    #1. Two integers `n` and `m` are read as input.
    #2. `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
    #3. If `k` is a power of 2, `k` is printed.
    #4. If `k` is not a power of 2, and `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, then 1 is printed.
    #5. If `k` is not a power of 2, and `n` is 0 and `m` is even, then 2 is printed.
    #6. If none of the above conditions are met, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Then, `k - q` is printed.
    #
    #After all iterations, the final values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `p`, and `q` will depend on the inputs provided for each iteration, but the loop will have completed its execution, and `i` will be equal to `t-1`. The specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` will be determined by the last set of inputs processed by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m` (which are renamed as `x` and `y` in the problem statement).

2. **Key Calculation**: The program calculates `k = abs(n - m)`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. This value `k` should represent the difference between `x` and `y` in the problem context.

3. **Special Cases**:
   - If `k & (k - 1) == 0`, this checks if `k` is a power of 2. If true, it prints `k`.
   - If `n == 0` and `m % 2 != 0`, it prints `1`.
   - If `n == 0` and `m % 2 == 0`, it prints `2`.
   - Otherwise, it converts `k` to binary, finds the length of the binary representation (`p`), calculates `q = 2 ** (p - 1)`, and prints `k - q`.

4. **Analysis of Special Cases**:
   - For the special case `n == 0 and m % 2 != 0`, the program prints `1`. This is correct because if `x` is `0` and `y` is an odd number, the first element of both sequences `a` and `b` will never match except at `a_1` and `b_1`, giving a common subsegment of length `1`.
   - For the special case `n == 0 and m % 2 == 0`, the program prints `2`. This is also correct because if `x` is `0` and `y` is an even number, the first two elements of both sequences `a` and `b` will match, giving a common subsegment of length `2`.
   - For the general case, the program calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and subtracts it from `k`. This approach is intended to find the length of the longest common subsegment by considering the binary representation of `k`.

5. **Binary Representation and Power of 2**:
   - The logic of converting `k` to binary and finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` is sound. The length of the longest common subsegment can indeed be derived from the binary representation of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and uses a valid approach to find the length of the longest common subsegment. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
