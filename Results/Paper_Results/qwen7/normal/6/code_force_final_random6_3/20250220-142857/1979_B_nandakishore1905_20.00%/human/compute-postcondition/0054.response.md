Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function processes the values of `x` and `y` and returns a specific value or message according to predefined rules.**

Note: The actual rules for processing `x` and `y` are not provided in the given information, so the description focuses on the structure and input parameters of the function.
