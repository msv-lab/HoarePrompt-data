Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from `t`, `m` is the second integer input split from `t`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `q` is introduced and assigned the value of \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
