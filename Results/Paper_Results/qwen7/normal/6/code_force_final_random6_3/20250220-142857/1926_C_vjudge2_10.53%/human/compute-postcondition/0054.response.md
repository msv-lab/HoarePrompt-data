Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 45.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `numbers` must contain at least 10 integers.
- `i` is 21.
- `word` is '21'.
- `last` is 1.
- `remainder` is 2.
- `sum_total` is 6.
- `values[11]` is 2.
- `sum_values[11]` is 1.
- `sum_values[12]` is 3.
- `sum_values[13]` is 6.
- `values[21]` is 3.
- `sum_values[21]` is 6.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(sum_values[n])
```

Here, `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `n` is used as an index in `sum_values`, it should be an integer. Given the context and the values provided, if `n` is intended to be `21` (as it's the only index mentioned that could fit the pattern), then `sum_values[21]` is 6.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value at `sum_values[21]`.

Output: **6**
