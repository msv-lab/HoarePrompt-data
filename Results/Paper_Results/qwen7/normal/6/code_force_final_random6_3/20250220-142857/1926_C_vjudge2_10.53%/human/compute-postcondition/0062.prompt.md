You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        numbers.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must still be greater than 0 (ensuring the loop ran `t` times), and `numbers` will be a list containing exactly `t` integers, each of which was input by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
    values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [(0) for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        
        total += i
        
        sum_values[i] = total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros (since the loop runs up to 9 times), `sum_values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros, `i` is 11.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs 10 times as specified by the `range(10)` statement. Each iteration sets `values[i]` to `i`, increments `total` by `i`, and updates `sum_values[i]` to the current value of `total`. After 10 iterations, `total` will be the sum of numbers from 0 to 9, which is 45. The variable `i` will be set to 11 after the last iteration since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The lists `values` and `sum_values` are updated according to the loop, but their final lengths and contents are determined by the loop's range, resulting in lists of length 10 filled with values from 0 to 9 for `values` and the cumulative sums from 0 to 45 for `sum_values`.
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which is 3 + 3 = 6. The `values` list will have the value 3 at index 21, and the `sum_values` list will have the cumulative sums from 0 to 6 at indices 11 to 21.
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list with 10 or more integers, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 12, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6, `sum_values[22]` is 9, `sum_values[23]` is 15, `sum_values[24]` is 21, `sum_values[25]` is 28, `sum_values[26]` is 36, `sum_values[27]` is 45, `values[22]` is 3, `values[23]` is 3, `values[24]` is 3, `values[25]` is 3, `values[26]` is 3, `values[27]` is 3.
    #
    #**Explanation:** After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which accumulates as the loop runs. Each iteration adds the value 3 to `values[i]` and updates `sum_values[i]` accordingly. By the end of the loop, `sum_total` will be 12 (from the initial value of 6 plus the contributions from the next 5 iterations), and `values` and `sum_values` will be updated to reflect these changes up to index 27.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function does not return any value explicitly but implies processing or validation of these integers within its body.
