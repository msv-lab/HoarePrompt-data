Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros (since the loop runs up to 9 times), `sum_values` is a list of length 9 filled with zeros, `i` is 11.

Explanation: The loop runs 10 times as specified by the `range(10)` statement. Each iteration sets `values[i]` to `i`, increments `total` by `i`, and updates `sum_values[i]` to the current value of `total`. After 10 iterations, `total` will be the sum of numbers from 0 to 9, which is 45. The variable `i` will be set to 11 after the last iteration since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The lists `values` and `sum_values` are updated according to the loop, but their final lengths and contents are determined by the loop's range, resulting in lists of length 10 filled with values from 0 to 9 for `values` and the cumulative sums from 0 to 45 for `sum_values`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10, n + 1):
    word = str(i)
    last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
    remainder = int(word[:-1])
    values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
    sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    sum_values[i] = sum_total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 10, `word` is '10', `last` is 0, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 0, `sum_values[10]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 11, `word` is '11', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 1, `values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[11]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 12, `word` is '12', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 3, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
