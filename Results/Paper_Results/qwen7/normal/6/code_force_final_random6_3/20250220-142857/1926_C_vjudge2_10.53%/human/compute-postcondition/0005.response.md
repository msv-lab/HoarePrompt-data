Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since we don't know the exact value of `t` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only ensure that it remains greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
