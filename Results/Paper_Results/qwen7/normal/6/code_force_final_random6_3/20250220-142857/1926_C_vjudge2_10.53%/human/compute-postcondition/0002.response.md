Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to focus on `t`.

3. **Current state before the loop**: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), inclusive, and `numbers` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is given to be between 1 and \(10^4\), it is already guaranteed to be greater than 0. However, we need to explicitly state this condition to ensure the loop can proceed.

5. **Final state after adjustment**: We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The state of `numbers` being an empty list does not affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is an empty list**
