Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Calculation of `values` and `sum_values`:**
   - The initial values for `values` and `sum_values` are set up for the first 10 numbers, but the logic for calculating the sum of digits for numbers greater than 10 is flawed.
   - The logic for calculating the sum of digits for numbers greater than 10 should be more straightforward and efficient.

2. **Efficiency Concerns:**
   - The current approach recalculates the sum of digits for each number from scratch, which is inefficient for large values of `n`.

3. **Logic for Larger Numbers:**
   - For numbers greater than 10, the current logic splits the number into its last digit and the remaining part, but it incorrectly uses previously computed sums without properly accumulating the results.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            # Calculate the sum of digits of the current number
            sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
            total_sum += sum_of_digits
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This solution iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, calculates the sum of its digits, and accumulates the result. This approach ensures correctness and efficiency, even for large values of `n`.
