Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[11]` is 2, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[12]` is 3, `sum_values[13]` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 6.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string representation of `i`, which is '21'. The `last` variable will be the last digit of `i`, which is 1, and `remainder` will be the integer formed by the remaining digits, which is 2. The `sum_total` will be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i-1]`, which is 3 + 3 = 6. The `values` list will have the value 3 at index 21, and the `sum_values` list will have the cumulative sums from 0 to 6 at indices 11 to 21.
