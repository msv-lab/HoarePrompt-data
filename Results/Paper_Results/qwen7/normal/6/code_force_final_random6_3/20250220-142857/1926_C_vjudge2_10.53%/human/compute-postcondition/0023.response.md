Output State: **`total` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 4, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[2]` is 1, `sum_values[4]` is 5**

Explanation: The code `sum_values[i] = total` updates the value of `sum_values[i]` to the value of `total`. Given that `i` is 4 and `total` is 5, `sum_values[4]` is now 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
