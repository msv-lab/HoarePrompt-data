Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 12, `word` is '12', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 1, `sum_total` is 1, `values[11]` is 1, `sum_values[11]` is 1, `last` is 1 (which is the last digit of the string '12').**

Explanation: The code `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` takes the last character of the string `word` which is '2', converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `last`. The value of `last` is now 1, which is the integer representation of the last character of the string '12'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
