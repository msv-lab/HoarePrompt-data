Output State: **`total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 10, `word` is '10', `last` is 0**

Explanation: The code `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` extracts the last character of the string `word` (which is '10') and converts it to an integer. Since the last character of '10' is '0', `last` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
