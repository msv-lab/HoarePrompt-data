Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `values` with a length equal to `max(numbers) + 1`, and fills it with zeros. This does not affect the values of `t` or `numbers`. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and `numbers` remains a list containing `t` integers, each of which was input by the user. The new list `values` is created and initialized to a list of zeros with a length based on the maximum value in `numbers` plus one.
