Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` must still be greater than 0 (ensuring the loop ran `t` times), and `numbers` will be a list that contains exactly `t` integers, each of which was input by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
