Output State: **`total` is 10, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 5, `values[i]` is 5, `sum_values[i]` is 10**

Explanation: The code `sum_values[i] = total` assigns the value of `total` (which is 10) to the element `sum_values[i]`. Since `i` is 5, `sum_values[5]` is now 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
