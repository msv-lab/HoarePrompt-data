Output State: `total` is 45, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length 10 filled with zeros, `i` is 21, `word` is '21', `last` is 1, `remainder` is 2, `sum_total` is 6, `values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[21]` is 3, `sum_values[12]` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 10 iterations, the variable `i` will be 21 because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `word` variable will hold the string '21' as the last number processed. The `last` variable will be 1 (the last digit of 21), and the `remainder` will be 2 (the remaining part of the number when the last digit is removed). The `sum_total` will be the cumulative sum up to `i`, which is 6 (0+1+2+...+5). The `values[i]` will be the cumulative sum up to `i-1`, which is 3 (0+1+2). The `sum_values[i]` will also be 3, reflecting the cumulative sum up to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop body or loop head.
