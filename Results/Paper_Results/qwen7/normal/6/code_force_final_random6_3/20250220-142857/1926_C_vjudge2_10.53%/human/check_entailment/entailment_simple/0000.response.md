### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` for each test case. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization of Lists**:
   - The lists `values` and `sum_values` are initialized incorrectly. They should be initialized to handle the maximum possible input size (`max(numbers) + 1`), but they are initialized to length 10 instead. This is a significant error because the actual maximum value of `n` can be up to \(2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - The code attempts to calculate the sum of digits for each number from 10 to `n` using a nested loop structure. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It tries to split the number into its last digit and the remaining part, but it does not correctly handle the sum of digits calculation. For example, for `i = 21`, it splits it into `last = 1` and `remainder = 2`, but it should sum the digits directly (i.e., `2 + 1 = 3`).

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated using the `sum_values` list, but the way the values are updated is incorrect. The `values` and `sum_values` lists should be updated to store the sum of digits for each number, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is generated by printing `sum_values[n]` for each test case, but since the `sum_values` list is not correctly populated, the output will be incorrect.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and produces incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: False**
