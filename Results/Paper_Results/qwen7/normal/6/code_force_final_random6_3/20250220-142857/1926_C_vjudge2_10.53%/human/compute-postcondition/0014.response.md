Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_values` as a list of zeros with a length equal to the maximum value in the `numbers` list plus one. The values of `t`, `numbers`, and `values` remain unchanged from their initial state.
