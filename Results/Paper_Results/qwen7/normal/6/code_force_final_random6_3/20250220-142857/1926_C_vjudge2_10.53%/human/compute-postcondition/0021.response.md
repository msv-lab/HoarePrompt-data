Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 4, `values[3]` is 3, `sum_values[2]` is 1**

Explanation: The line `values[i] = i` updates the value of `values[i]` to `i`. Given that `i` was initially 3, after executing this line, `values[3]` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
