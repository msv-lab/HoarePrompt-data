Output State: **`total` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer is an input integer from the user, `values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `sum_values` is a list of length max(`numbers`) + 1 filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `sum_values[2]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `sum_values[i] = total` updates the `sum_values` list by setting the element at index `i` (which is 2) to the value of `total` (which is 1). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
