Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `numbers` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `numbers` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `numbers` remains an empty list, and `n` now holds the integer value input by the user.
