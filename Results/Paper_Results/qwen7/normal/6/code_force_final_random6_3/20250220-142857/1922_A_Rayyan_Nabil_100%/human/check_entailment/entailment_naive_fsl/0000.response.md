Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`, but this is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  3
  abb
  abb
  abb
  3
  aab
  aab
  aab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  ```

In the first test case, both `a` and `b` are `"abb"`, and `c` is also `"abb"`. The function `func_1` will return `'YES'` because `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` for all positions `i`. However, there is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

In the second test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are all `"aab"`. Again, the function `func_1` will return `'YES'` because `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` for all positions `i`. There is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

The function `func_1` does not account for the constraints that the template must allow `a` and `b` to match but disallow `c`. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
