The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `a` and `b` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It also accepts a parameter `c`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]` is true. If it finds such a pair, it returns 'YES'. If it goes through all indices without finding any such pair, it returns 'NO'.
