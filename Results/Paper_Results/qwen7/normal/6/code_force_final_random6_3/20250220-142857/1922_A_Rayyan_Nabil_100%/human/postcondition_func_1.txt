The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of an integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). For each set, it calls another function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and stores the result. After processing all sets, it prints the results of these function calls. The final state of the program includes \( t \) being 0, and the variables \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) holding the last set of inputs provided.
