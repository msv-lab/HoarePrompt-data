Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input string of length `n`.
   - `b` is an input string of length `n`.
   - `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, it remains unchanged.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value (which is greater than 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (since it was initially greater than 0 and is now decremented by 1).
- All other variables remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string of length `n`, `b` is an input string of length `n`, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, `_` is 1, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
