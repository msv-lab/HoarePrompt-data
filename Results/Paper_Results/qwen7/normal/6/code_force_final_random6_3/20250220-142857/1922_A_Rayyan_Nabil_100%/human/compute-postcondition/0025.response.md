Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the length of the `results` list.
- `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are final input strings stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t-1`.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list after the last element in the `results` list.

The `print(result)` statement will print the next element in the `results` list, which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the `t`-th iteration.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, a, b, c) for the t-th iteration**
