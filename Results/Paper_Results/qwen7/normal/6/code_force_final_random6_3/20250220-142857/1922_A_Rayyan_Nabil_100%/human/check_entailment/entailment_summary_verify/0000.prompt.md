You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set consists of an integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). For each set, it calls another function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and stores the result. After processing all sets, it prints the results of these function calls. The final state of the program includes \( t \) being 0, and the variables \( n \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) holding the last set of inputs provided.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`, but this is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  3
  abb
  abb
  abb
  3
  aab
  aab
  aab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  YES
  ```

In the first test case, both `a` and `b` are `"abb"`, and `c` is also `"abb"`. The function `func_1` will return `'YES'` because `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` for all positions `i`. However, there is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

In the second test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are all `"aab"`. Again, the function `func_1` will return `'YES'` because `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` for all positions `i`. There is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match, since `a`, `b`, and `c` are identical.

The function `func_1` does not account for the constraints that the template must allow `a` and `b` to match but disallow `c`. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
