Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be equal to 0, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t`, `_` is `t`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last inputs provided during the loop's execution. The `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the length of the `results` list, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t`, `_` is `t`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the length of the `results` list, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration from 1 to `t-1`, and `result` is the next element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is the next element in the `results` list, `n` is an integer input stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `a` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the final input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
