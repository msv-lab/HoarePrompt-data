Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is the minimum value between the original `m` and `k`, `k` is the third element of `L`, `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`, `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`, `w` is the last element of `N` before popping, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`, `n` is the current length of `N` + 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `cost` variable by adding `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` to its current value. Here, `sum(N)` is the sum of all elements in the list `N`, `m` is the value of `m`, `n` is the current length of `N`, and `mu` is the value of `k - (n - 1) * m`. The length of `N` increases by 1 because the last element of `N` before popping is added to `N`. All other variables remain unchanged.
