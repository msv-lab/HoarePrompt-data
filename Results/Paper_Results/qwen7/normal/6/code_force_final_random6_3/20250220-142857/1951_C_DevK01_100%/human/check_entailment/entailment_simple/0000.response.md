### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for each test case, including `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices `a`.

2. **Sorting and Initial Setup**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` and calculates the number of days required to purchase `k` tickets (`q`). This step ensures that the most expensive days come later, which helps in minimizing the overall cost.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy all tickets without needing to increase the price mid-way. The cost calculation here is straightforward.
   - If `n * m != k`, the program handles the remaining tickets by popping the last element from the sorted list `N` and calculating the additional cost due to the price increase.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the product of `n` and `m`.
   - It also correctly resets the state for each test case.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case and continues to the next test case until all test cases are processed.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the solution.

### Correctness:
**True**

The annotated program accurately reflects the logic and correctly processes each test case to find the minimum cost for purchasing `k` tickets under the given constraints.
