Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `L` is a list of integers entered by the user, `M` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `n` is the first element of `L`, `m` is the second element of `L`, `k` is the third element of `L`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first, second, and third elements of the list `L` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `L` remain unchanged, and `M` is also left unaffected.
