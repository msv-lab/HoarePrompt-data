To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `L` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers from the input string.
   - `n` is the length of `N`.
   - `m` is the minimum value between the second and third elements of `L`.
   - `k` is the third element of `L`.
   - `q` is the ceiling value of `k / m`.
   - `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `N` is a list containing the first `q-1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element of `N` before it was popped.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Given the complexity, let's assume a specific example to illustrate the calculation:

Assume:
- `L = [1, 2, 6]`
- `M = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `N` is derived from `M` based on `q`.

From `L`:
- `m = min(2, 6) = 2`
- `k = 6`

Calculate `q`:
- `q = ceil(6 / 2) = 3`

So, `N` contains the first 3 elements of `M`:
- `N = [1, 2, 3]`

Check if `n * m == k`:
- Let's assume `n = 3` (length of `N`).
- `n * m = 3 * 2 = 6`
- Since `6 == 6`, we use the first formula for `cost`:
  - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`
  - `sum(N) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
  - `cost = 2 * 6 + 2 * 2 * ((3 - 1) * 3 // 2)`
  - `cost = 12 + 8 = 20`

Thus, the cost is 20.

Output: **20**
