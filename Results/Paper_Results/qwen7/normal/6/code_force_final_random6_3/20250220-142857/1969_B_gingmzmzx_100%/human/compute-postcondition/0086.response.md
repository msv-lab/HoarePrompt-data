Output State: **All elements in `s` have been processed, `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` hold the counts of 0s and 1s in `s`, respectively, `ans` is the sum of 1s in `s` plus the maximum difference between the number of zeroes and the count of 0s encountered so far for each element in `s` that is not 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt[0]` will contain the total number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt[1]` will contain the total number of ones, and `ans` will be the total number of ones in `s` plus the highest value of `zeroes - cnt[0]` encountered during the loop's execution for any element that is not zero.
