Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for c in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `c` and `s`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is [1, 1]
   - `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`
   - `ans` is 2
   - `s` must contain at least one element
   - `c` is the first element of the updated list `s`

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `s`.
   - After the previous iteration, `c` is the first element of the updated list `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `c` is the first element of the updated list `s`, after the next iteration, `c` will be the second element of the updated list `s`.
   - The list `s` will lose its first element (which is `c`).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `cnt` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the updated list `s` after removing the first element.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop.
   - `s` will now be the list without its first element.
   - `c` will be the second element of the updated list `s`.

Based on the above reasoning, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`cnt` is [1, 1], `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the updated list `s`, `ans` is 2, `s` must contain at least one element, and `c` is the second element of the updated list `s`**.
