Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `c` is the next character in `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `zeroes` remains unchanged.**

This means that `ans` is incremented by 1 only if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. The value of `c` remains the same as the next character in `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `zeroes` remains unchanged.
