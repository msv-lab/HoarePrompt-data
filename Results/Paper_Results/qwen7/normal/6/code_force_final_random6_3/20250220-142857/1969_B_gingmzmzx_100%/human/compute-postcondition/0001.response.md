Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a placeholder variable) and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**
