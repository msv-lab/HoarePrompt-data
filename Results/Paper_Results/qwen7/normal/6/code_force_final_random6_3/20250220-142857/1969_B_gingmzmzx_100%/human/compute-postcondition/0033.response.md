Output State: **`cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `ans` is 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables (`cnt`, `zeroes`, `s`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
