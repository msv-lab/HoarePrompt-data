Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality for Maximum Beauty Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `func_1`. If it is, it prints `0`, which is not always correct.
   - The correct approach should be to sort the array and calculate the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

2. **Sorting and Calculation:**
   - The program sorts the array `b` and calculates the beauty correctly, but this part is only executed if `func_1` returns `False`.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not correctly identify whether the array can achieve the maximum beauty through rearrangement. It only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not sufficient.

3. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It counts the number of elements that are not in increasing order, but this does not help in determining the maximum beauty achievable by rearranging the array.

To fix these issues, the program should directly sort the array and compute the beauty without relying on the `func_1` function. Here's the corrected version:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    # Sort the array
    b = sorted(a)
    # Calculate the beauty
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version directly sorts the array and calculates the beauty as required, ensuring the maximum possible beauty is achieved.
