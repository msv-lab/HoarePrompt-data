Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), after executing `t = int(input())`, `t` retains this property, being an integer input within the specified range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
