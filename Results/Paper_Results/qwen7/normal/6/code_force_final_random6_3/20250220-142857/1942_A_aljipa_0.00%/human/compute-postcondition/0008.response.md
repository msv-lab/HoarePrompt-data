Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`.
     - Otherwise, if `k` equals 1, `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - Otherwise, `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*res)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print(*res)` statement unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces.
   - The value of `res` depends on the value of `k` relative to `n`:
     - If `k == n`, then `res` is a list with `n` elements, all set to 1.
     - If `k == 1`, then `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`, which will be printed as a space-separated sequence of numbers.
     - Otherwise, `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.

Given these conditions, let's consider the different cases:

- **Case 1**: `k == n`
  - `res` is a list with `n` elements, all set to 1.
  - The output will be: `1 1 1 ... 1` (with `n` ones).

- **Case 2**: `k == 1`
  - `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
  - The output will be: `0 1 2 ... (n-1)` (a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

- **Case 3**: `k != n` and `k != 1`
  - `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.
  - The output will be: `-1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we need to consider the general cases. However, the most precise description based on the given conditions is:

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (with n ones) if k == n, 0 1 2 ... (n-1) if k == 1, -1 otherwise**
