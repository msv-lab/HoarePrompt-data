Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `res` is either a list with `n` elements all set to 1, or a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`, or a list with a single element `-1`.

Given the possible values for `res`, let's consider each case:

1. If `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1, then `res` would look like `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (with `n` ones).
2. If `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1`, then `res` would look like `range(0, n)`.
3. If `res` is a list with a single element `-1`, then `res` would look like `[-1]`.

The `print(*res)` statement will unpack `res` and print its elements separated by spaces.

Since the exact value of `res` is not specified, we need to consider all possible cases:

- If `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1, the output will be `1 1 ... 1` (with `n` ones).
- If `res` is a range object, the output will be `0 1 2 ... n-1`.
- If `res` is a list with a single element `-1`, the output will be `-1`.

Given the format requirement, we need to provide a general answer that covers all possibilities:

Output: **1 1 ... 1 (with n ones), 0 1 2 ... n-1, or -1 depending on the value of res**
