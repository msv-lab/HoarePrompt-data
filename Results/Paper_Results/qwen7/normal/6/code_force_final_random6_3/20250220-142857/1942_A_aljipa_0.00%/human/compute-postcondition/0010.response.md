Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list with a single element `-1`, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

This output state reflects that the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged except for `n` and `k`, which are now assigned the integer values from the input split. The value of `res` depends on the comparison between `n` and `k`.
