Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list with a single element `-1`.

### Loop Head:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the state directly.
- The loop condition is based on the value of `t`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: `t` must be greater than 0.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t > 0`.
3. **Effect of One Iteration**: After one iteration of the loop, `t` will be decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` will iterate `t` times).

### Updated State:
- Since the loop will execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.
- Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1 (because it was initially greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1).

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is a list with `n` elements all set to 1 if `k` equals `n`, otherwise `res` is a range object representing numbers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, otherwise `res` is a list with a single element `-1`**.
