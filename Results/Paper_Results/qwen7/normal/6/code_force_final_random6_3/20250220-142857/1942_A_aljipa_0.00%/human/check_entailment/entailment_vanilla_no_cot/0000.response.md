Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. Let's break down why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - When `k == n`, it means every cyclic shift should be sorted. This can be achieved by having an array where all elements are the same, like `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. The solution uses `[1] * n` which is correct.
   - When `k == 1`, it means only one cyclic shift should be sorted. The provided solution uses `range(n)` which is incorrect because `range(n)` generates a list of numbers from `0` to `n-1`, and this will not necessarily result in only one sorted cyclic shift.
   - When `k != n` and `k != 1`, the solution returns `[-1]` which is incorrect because there might still be valid arrays that meet the criteria.

2. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case `3 1`, the expected output is an array with exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The provided solution outputs `range(n)`, which does not guarantee that only one cyclic shift is sorted.
   - For the test case `3 2`, the expected output is `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly two sorted cyclic shifts for an array of length 3. The provided solution incorrectly outputs `range(n)`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to generate an array that meets the specific criteria for `k` sorted cyclic shifts. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k == n:
            print(' '.join(map(str, [1] * n)))
        elif k == 1:
            # Generate an array with one sorted cyclic shift
            res = [1] + [10**9] * (n - 1)
            print(*res)
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This solution correctly handles the cases where `k == n` and `k == 1` and outputs `-1` for other cases where it's impossible to meet the criteria.
