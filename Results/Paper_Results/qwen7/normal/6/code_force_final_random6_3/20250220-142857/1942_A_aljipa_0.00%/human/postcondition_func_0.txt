The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It outputs a list \( res \) based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case. If \( k \) equals \( n \), the list contains \( n \) ones. If \( k \) equals 1, the list is a range object from 0 to \( n-1 \). Otherwise, the list contains a single element \(-1\). The function does not return any value but prints the resulting list for each test case.
