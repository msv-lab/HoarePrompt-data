Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is `n-2`
   - `i` is 12
   - `p[12]` is `n`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes the values 0, 2, 4, ..., `n-2`.

4. **Analyze the previous iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 12.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `12 + 2 = 14`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `i` will be 14.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 14.

Given these points, the updated states are:
- `ind` remains as `n-2`.
- `i` becomes 14.
- `n` must be greater than 14.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ind` is `n-2`, `i` is 14, `n` must be greater than 14**
