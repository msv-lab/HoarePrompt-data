Output State: **`i` is 22; `n` must be greater than 22; `p[i]` is assigned the value `ind`.**

The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the index `i` in the list `p`. Since `i` is initially 22, `p[22]` is now set to `ind`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
