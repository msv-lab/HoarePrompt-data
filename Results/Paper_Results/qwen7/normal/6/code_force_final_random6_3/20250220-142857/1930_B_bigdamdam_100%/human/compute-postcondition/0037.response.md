Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `p` is a list of length `n` with elements [0, 0, ..., 0, `n-5`], `ind` is `n-5`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `p` is a list of length `n` with elements `[0, 0, ..., 0, n-3]`, and `ind` is `n-3`. After executing `ind -= 2`, the value of `ind` is reduced by 2, making it `n-5`. The list `p` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
