Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `p` is a list where an element at index `i` is assigned the value `ind-2`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decreased by 2. The initial state of `n` being at least 2 and the structure of the list `p` remain unchanged. The updated value of `ind` is used to assign the new value to the corresponding element in the list `p`.
