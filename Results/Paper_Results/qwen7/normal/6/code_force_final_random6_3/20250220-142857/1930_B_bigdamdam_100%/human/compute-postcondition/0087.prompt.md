You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop runs until `i` reaches the highest odd number less than `n` or `i` equals `n` if `n` is even. After all iterations, `ind` will be `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of iterations)`, and `i` will be the highest odd number less than `n` or `n` if `n` is even. The list `p` will contain values such that `p[i]` for even indices is `ind + 2 * (number of iterations / 2)` and for odd indices is `ind + 2 * ((number of iterations + 1) / 2)`.
    #
    #To calculate the exact output state after the loop completes all iterations:
    #- `i` will be the largest odd number less than `n` if `n` is even, otherwise `n-1` if `n` is odd.
    #- `ind` will be `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of iterations)`, which simplifies to `1 + n % 2 + n // 2` since the number of iterations is `n // 2` if `n` is even and `(n - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd.
    #- The list `p` will be filled such that for even indices, `p[i] = ind + 2 * (i // 2)`, and for odd indices, `p[i] = ind + 2 * ((i + 1) // 2)`.
    #
    #For example, if `n` is 11:
    #- `i` will be 10 (the largest odd number less than 11).
    #- `ind` will be `1 + 11 % 2 + 11 // 2 = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7`.
    #- The list `p` will be filled as follows:
    #  - `p[0] = 7`
    #  - `p[1] = 9`
    #  - `p[2] = 11`
    #  - `p[3] = 13`
    #  - `p[4] = 15`
    #  - `p[5] = 17`
    #  - `p[6] = 19`
    #  - `p[7] = 21`
    #  - `p[8] = 23`
    #  - `p[9] = 25`
    #  - `p[10] = 27`
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
    #Output State: `i` is 10, `ind` is 7, `n` is 11, `p[0]` is 7, `p[1]` is 9, `p[2]` is 11, `p[3]` is 13, `p[4]` is 15, `p[5]` is 17, `p[6]` is 19, `p[7]` is 21, `p[8]` is 23, `p[9]` is 25, `p[10]` is 27.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function processes `t` and `n` and returns a result based on these values.
