Output State: **`ind` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd, `i` is 2, `p[1]` is `ind`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ind` to `p[i]`. Since `i` is initially 1, `p[1]` is updated to the current value of `ind`. The values of `ind` and `n` (whether `n` is even or odd) remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.
