Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 4`, `p` is a list of length `n` with elements [0, 0, ..., 0, `n-5`], `ind` is `n-5`, and `p[i]` is `n-5`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ind` (which is `n-5`) to the index `i` in the list `p`. Since `i` is `i_prev + 4`, the element at index `i_prev + 4` in the list `p` is now `n-5`. All other elements in the list `p` remain unchanged as they were initially set to 0. The variable `ind` remains unchanged and still holds the value `n-5`.
