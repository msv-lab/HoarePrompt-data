Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `p` is a list where an element at index `i+2` is assigned the value `ind-2`; the element at index `i` in list `p` is now `ind`; `ind` is decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decreases the value of `ind` by 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ind`.
