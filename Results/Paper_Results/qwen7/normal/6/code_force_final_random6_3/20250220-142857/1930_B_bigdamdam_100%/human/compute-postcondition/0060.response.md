Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `ind` is equal to `n`.
   - `i` is initially 12.
   - `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(0, n, 2)` to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function will start from 0 and increment by 2 until it reaches `n-1` if `n` is even or `n` if `n` is odd.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initially 12, it does not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as `n` is valid.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ind` is `n`, `i` is 12, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `n` must be greater than 0**
