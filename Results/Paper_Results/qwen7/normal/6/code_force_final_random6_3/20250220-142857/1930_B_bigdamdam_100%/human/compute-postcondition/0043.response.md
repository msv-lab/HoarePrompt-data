Output State: **`ind` is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd.**

Explanation: The code `ind = 1 + n % 2` assigns the value of `ind` based on whether `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, `n % 2` equals 0, so `ind` becomes `1 + 0`, which is `1`. If `n` is odd, `n % 2` equals 1, so `ind` becomes `1 + 1`, which is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
