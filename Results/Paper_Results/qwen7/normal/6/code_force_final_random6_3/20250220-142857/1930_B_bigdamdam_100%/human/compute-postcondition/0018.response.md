Output State: **`i` is `1 + n % 2`, `p[i]` is assigned `ind`, `ind` is `ind + 2`**

Explanation: The initial state sets `i` to `1 + n % 2`. The variable `p[i]` is assigned the value of `ind`. Then, the line `ind += 2` increments `ind` by 2. The output state reflects these changes while keeping the initial conditions intact.
