Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code takes input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer in the list to `n`. The value of `i` remains `i_prev + 1` as it was not affected by the code.
