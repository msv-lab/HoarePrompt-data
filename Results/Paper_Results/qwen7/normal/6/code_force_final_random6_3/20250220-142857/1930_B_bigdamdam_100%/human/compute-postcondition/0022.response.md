Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `1` and increments by `2` each time until it reaches a value less than `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `3 + n % 2`
   - `p[i]` is `ind + 2`
   - `ind` is `ind + 4`

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments by `2`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - Given `i = 3 + n % 2`, the next value of `i` would be `(3 + n % 2) + 2 = 5 + n % 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the condition for the next iteration is `5 + n % 2 < n`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `5 + n % 2`.
   - `p[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is `5 + n % 2`).
   - `ind` will be updated to `ind + 4` as per the given information.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `5 + n % 2`, `p[i]` is `ind + 2`, `ind` is `ind + 4`**
