Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` means that `i` will take on odd values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`, incrementing by 2 each time.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - Given: `ind` is `1 + n % 2`.
   - This implies that `ind` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `n` is even or odd.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be within the range specified by the `range` function, which is from 1 to `n` (exclusive) with a step of 2.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the minimum value for `n` is 1 (because if `n` were 0 or less, the range would be empty).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` will be set to `ind` at the start of the loop, so `i` must be equal to `1 + n % 2`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `1 + n % 2`, `n` must be greater than 0**
