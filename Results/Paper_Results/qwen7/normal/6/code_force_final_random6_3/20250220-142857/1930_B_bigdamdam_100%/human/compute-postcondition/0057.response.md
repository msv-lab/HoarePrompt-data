Output State: **`ind` is 14, `i` is 12, `p[1]` is 1, `p[4]` is 2, `p[6]` is 4, `p[9]` is 6, `p[12]` is 12, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.**

The code creates a list from the first integer input split by spaces and assigns it to `n`. Since only the first integer is used, the value of `n` will be the integer entered by the user, and the other variables remain unchanged.
