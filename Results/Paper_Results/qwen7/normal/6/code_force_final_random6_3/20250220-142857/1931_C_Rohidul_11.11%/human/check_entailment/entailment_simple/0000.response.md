Reasoning:
1. The program iterates over each test case using a loop controlled by `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It then initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array from both ends.
4. The variable `st` counts the number of consecutive duplicates from the start of the array, and `end` counts the number of consecutive duplicates from the end of the array.
5. The logic inside the loops ensures that `l` skips over consecutive duplicates from the start, and `r` skips over consecutive duplicates from the end.
6. After the loops, the program checks different conditions to determine the minimum cost:
   - If the first and last elements are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the minimum cost is calculated as `r - l - 1`.
   - If there are no consecutive duplicates at the start or end (`st == 0` and `end == 0`) and the first and last elements are different (`a[0] != a[-1]`), the minimum cost is `len(a) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, the minimum cost is `r - l`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The state analysis at the end confirms that the variables are set appropriately before printing the result.

Correctness: **True**
