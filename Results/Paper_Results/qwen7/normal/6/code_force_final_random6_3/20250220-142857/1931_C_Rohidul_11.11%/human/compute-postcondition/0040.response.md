Output State: **`st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by 1, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if the first and last elements are identical and there are consecutive identical elements at the start, or `len(a) - 1` if the first and last elements are not identical, or `n - 1 - l` otherwise, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The values of `st`, `end`, `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The input integer `n` is now stored in `n`.
