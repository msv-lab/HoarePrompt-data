Output State: `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `st` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements at the start of the list. The variable `end` will indicate the total number of times the loop has executed, which is equivalent to the number of pairs of consecutive identical elements found and processed. `l` will be the index right after the last pair of identical elements that were found and processed, and `r` will remain as `n - 1` because it is not modified within the loop.
