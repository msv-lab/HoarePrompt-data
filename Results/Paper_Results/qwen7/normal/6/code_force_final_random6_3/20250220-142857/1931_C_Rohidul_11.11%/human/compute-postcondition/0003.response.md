Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**.

This means that the variables `n` and `a` retain their initial states. The new variables `l` and `r` have been initialized to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively.
