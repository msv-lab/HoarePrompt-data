Output State: **`l` is either 0 or `n - 1`, `r` is either 0 or `n - 1`, `st` is either 4 or 0, `end` is either 4 or 0, `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
