Output State: **`st` is 0, `end` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is either `r - l - 1` if the first and last elements are identical and there are consecutive identical elements at the start, or `len(a) - 1` if the first and last elements are not identical, or `n - 1 - l` otherwise, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `st` and `end` to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, `ans`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes while keeping the rest of the variables in their initial conditions.
