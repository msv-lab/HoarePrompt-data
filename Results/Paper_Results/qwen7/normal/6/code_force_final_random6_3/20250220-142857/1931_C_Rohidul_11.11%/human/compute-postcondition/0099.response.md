Output State: **`l` is equal to `r - 3`, `r` is `n - 4`, and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` becomes `r - 1`. Given the initial conditions, `l` was originally `r - 2`, so now `l` is `r - 1 - 2` which simplifies to `r - 3`. Similarly, since `r` was initially `n - 3`, now `r` is `n - 4`. The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` remains true as no changes were made to the array `a`.
