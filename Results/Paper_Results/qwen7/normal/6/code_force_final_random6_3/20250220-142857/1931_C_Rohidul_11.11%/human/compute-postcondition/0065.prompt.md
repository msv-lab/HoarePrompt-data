Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 3.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, we know that `l` has increased by 3 (from 0 to 3, then to 4, and so on). After the third iteration, `l` becomes 4. For the loop to continue, `r` must be greater than `l`, which means `r` must be greater than 3. However, since the loop condition is `l < r`, and `l` eventually equals `r`, the final values of `l` and `r` will be the same, which is `n - 1`. The variable `st` increments by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `st` is 3.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is 4, `r` is greater than 3, `st` is 3, `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is 4, `r` is 3, `st` is 3, `end` is increased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is 4, `r` is 3, `st` is 3, `end` is 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
