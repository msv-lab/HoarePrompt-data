Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `l` is either 0 or `n - 1`.
   - `r` is either 0 or `n - 1`.
   - `st` is either 4 or 0.
   - `end` is either 4 or 0.
   - `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

2. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - To determine the value of `ans`, we need to know the value of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`.
   - Since the value of `a[0]` and `a[-1]` is not explicitly given, we need to consider both possibilities:
     - If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is the length of `a` minus 1.
     - If `a[0] != a[-1]`, then `ans` is 0.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(max(0, ans))`.
   - This statement ensures that the value printed is at least 0, even if `ans` is negative (which it cannot be based on the given conditions).

Given the conditions, let's analyze the possible values of `ans`:
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans = len(a) - 1`.
- If `a[0] != a[-1]`, then `ans = 0`.

Since `ans` is determined by the equality of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and there is no explicit information about the contents of `a`, we consider the general case where `ans` could be any non-negative integer or 0.

However, since the print statement uses `max(0, ans)`, the minimum value `ans` can take is 0. Therefore, the print statement will always output 0.

Output: **0**
