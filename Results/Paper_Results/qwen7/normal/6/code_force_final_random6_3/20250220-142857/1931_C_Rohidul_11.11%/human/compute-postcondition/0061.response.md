Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `r` is greater than `l` and the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is 4
   - `r` is 3
   - `st` is 3 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `end` is increased by 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must be true.
   - Currently, `r` is 3 and `l` is 4, so `r > l` is false.
   - To make `r > l` true, we need to increase `r` or decrease `l`.

4. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - We can increase `r` to a value greater than `l`.
   - Alternatively, we can decrease `l` to a value less than `r`.

5. **Ensure the Other Condition is Met**:
   - The condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` must also be true.
   - Since `r` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `a[3] == a[2]`.

### Conclusion:
To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust either `r` to a value greater than `l` or `l` to a value less than `r`, while ensuring that `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

Given the current values, let's assume we adjust `r` to a value greater than `l`. A simple adjustment could be setting `r` to 4 (assuming `a[4] == a[3]`).

### Final State:
State: **`l` is 4, `r` is 4, `st` is 3, `end` is increased by 1**

This ensures that `r > l` becomes true and the loop can continue.
