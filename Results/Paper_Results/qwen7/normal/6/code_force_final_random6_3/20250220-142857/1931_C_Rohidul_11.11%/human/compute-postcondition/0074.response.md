Output State: **`ans` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 4, `end` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l` calculates the difference between `r` and `l`. Given that both `l` and `r` are equal to `n - 1`, the result of `r - l` is 0. Therefore, `ans` is assigned the value 0. The values of `st`, `end`, and the relationship between `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
