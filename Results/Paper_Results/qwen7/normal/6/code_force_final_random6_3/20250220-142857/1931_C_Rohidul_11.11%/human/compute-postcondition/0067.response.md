Output State: **`ans` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 4, `end` is 4**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l - 1` calculates the value of `ans` based on the current values of `r` and `l`. Given that both `l` and `r` are equal to `n - 1`, the expression `r - l - 1` evaluates to `(n - 1) - (n - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `-1`. However, since `ans` is an integer, the result is rounded down to `0`. The values of `st` and `end` remain unchanged.
