Output State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, and the value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Given the initial state, `ans` was `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2`. Since `cnt` is 0, the term `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2` is 0, so `ans` is simply updated to `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
