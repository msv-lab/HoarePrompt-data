Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged. The value of `x` is now an integer derived from `data[idx]`, but the specific value of `x` is not provided since `data[idx]` is not specified.
