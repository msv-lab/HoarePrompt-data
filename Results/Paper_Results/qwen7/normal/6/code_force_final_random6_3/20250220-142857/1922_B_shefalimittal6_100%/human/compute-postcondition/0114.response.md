Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and `x` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `idx` has been incremented by 1, while `n` still must be greater than 0.
