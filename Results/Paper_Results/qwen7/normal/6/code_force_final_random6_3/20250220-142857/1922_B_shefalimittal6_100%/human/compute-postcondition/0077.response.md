Output State: **`idx` is equal to the initial value of `idx` plus `n`, `v[data[idx-1]]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` is assigned the value of `data[idx-1]` and `n` is the number of iterations, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `idx`, `v[data[idx-1]]`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were before the line of code was executed, with `ans` now set to 0.
