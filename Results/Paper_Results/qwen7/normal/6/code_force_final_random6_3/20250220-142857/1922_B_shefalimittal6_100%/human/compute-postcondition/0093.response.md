Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i + 1]`, `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, `v[i]` is increased by `(v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` updates the value of `ans` by adding the product of `v[i]`, `v[i] - 1`, and `v[i] - 2` divided by 6. This does not affect the values of `cnt` and `i`, nor does it change the condition that `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)` and `n` is a non-negative integer. However, it does modify `v[i]` by increasing its value by `(v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Since `v[i + 1]` was previously checked for conditions involving `ans`, and now `v[i]` has changed, the conditions involving `v[i + 1]` would also need to be re-evaluated, but they are not directly impacted by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes the increase in `v[i]` and the unchanged conditions for `cnt`, `i`, `n`, and the original logic for updating `ans`.
