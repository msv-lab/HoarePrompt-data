Output State: **`i` is 3, `cnt` is the sum of `v[1]` and `v[0]`, `ans` is `ans` plus `cnt` times `v[3]` times (`v[3]` minus 1) divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt` is the sum of `v[1]` and `v[0]`, and `ans` remains unchanged, `ans` is now `ans` plus `cnt` times `v[3]` times (`v[3]` minus 1) divided by 2.
