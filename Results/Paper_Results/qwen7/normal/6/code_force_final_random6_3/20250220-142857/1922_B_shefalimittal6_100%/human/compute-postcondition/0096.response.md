Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increases the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. The conditions for `ans` remain unchanged because the increment of `cnt` does not affect the conditions involving `v[i + 1]`. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions for `ans` as described in the initial state, except for the updated value of `cnt`.
