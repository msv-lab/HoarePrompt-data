Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 2; `x` is assigned the value of `data[idx-1]`; `v[x]` is incremented by 1; `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since `x` is already assigned the value of `data[idx-1]`, `v[data[idx-1]]` is incremented. The other variables (`idx`, `x`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
