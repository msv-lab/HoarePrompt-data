Output State: **All elements in `v` have been processed, `cnt` is increased by `v[i]` for each `i` in the range `[3, n + 1)`, and `ans` is updated according to the formulae provided in the loop body for each `i` in the same range.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `cnt` will be the sum of all values in `v`.
- `ans` will be the cumulative sum of the terms `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` and `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from `0` to `n` inclusive, where these terms are added only if `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2 and 3 respectively.
