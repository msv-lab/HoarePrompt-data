Reasoning:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates through this list to process each test case.
2. **Counting Frequencies**: For each test case, it initializes an array `v` to count the occurrences of each possible stick length (from 0 to \( n \)).
3. **Calculating Combinations**: It calculates the number of valid triplets:
   - If a stick length appears at least twice, it adds the combination of pairs to the answer.
   - If a stick length appears at least three times, it adds the combination of triplets to the answer.
4. **Storing and Printing Results**: It stores the result for each test case in a list and prints them after processing all test cases.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. There are no apparent logical errors or misinterpretations in the code.

Correctness: **True**
