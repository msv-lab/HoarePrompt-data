Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `idx` is `n + 1`, each element in `v` from index 0 to `n` is incremented by 1 for each corresponding element in `data`, `n` remains unchanged, `t` is decremented by `n`, and `results` remains unchanged.**

This means that the variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. The variable `idx` is set to `n + 1`, and the list `v` has been incremented by 1 for each element corresponding to the indices in `data` up to index `n`. The variable `n` retains its original value, `t` is decreased by `n`, and `results` is not modified.
