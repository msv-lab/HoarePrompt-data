Output State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6 + cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2`. Since `cnt` is 1, this simplifies to `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2`. This value is added to the existing `ans` value, which was initially defined as `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`. All other variables (`idx`, `cnt`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
