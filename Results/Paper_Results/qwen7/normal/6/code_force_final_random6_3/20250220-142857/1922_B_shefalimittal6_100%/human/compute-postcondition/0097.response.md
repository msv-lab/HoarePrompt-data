Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` was in the previous iteration, it will be `i + 1` in the next iteration. 

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is increased by `v[i]`.
- `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
- If `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`.
- If `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same unless the loop condition changes, but since the loop condition is based on `i` and not `n`, `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State:**
**`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.**

State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, `i` is in the range `[2, n + 1)`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further increased by `cnt * v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) // 2 + v[i + 1] * (v[i + 1] - 1) * (v[i + 1] - 2) // 6`. If `v[i + 1]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged.**
