Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. Since no specific value for `v` or `x` was given, we can only state that `v[x]` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `n` and the state of `idx` remain unchanged from the initial state.
