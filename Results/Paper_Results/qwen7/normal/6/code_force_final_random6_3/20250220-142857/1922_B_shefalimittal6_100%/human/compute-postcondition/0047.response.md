Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

4. **Update the value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 3 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` will be 4, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `total` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `idx` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6 + cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2 + v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `cnt` is 2, `idx` is 3 + n**
