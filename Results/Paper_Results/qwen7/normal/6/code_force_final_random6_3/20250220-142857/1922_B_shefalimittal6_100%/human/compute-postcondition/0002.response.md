Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `idx` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for the new value of `idx`.
