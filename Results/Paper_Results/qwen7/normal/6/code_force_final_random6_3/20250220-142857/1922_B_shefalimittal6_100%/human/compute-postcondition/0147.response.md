Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of these two variables.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 for each iteration. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `cnt`, `ans`, and `v` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3**
