Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 1; `x` is assigned the value of `data[idx]`; `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(data[idx])` increments `idx` by 1 (to move to the next element in the list `data`) and assigns the integer value of the current element in `data` (at index `idx`) to `x`. The condition that `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
