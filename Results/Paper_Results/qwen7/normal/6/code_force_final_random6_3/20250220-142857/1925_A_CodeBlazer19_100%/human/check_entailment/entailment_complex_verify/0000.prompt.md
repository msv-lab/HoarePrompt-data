You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `i` is now equal to `t`, which means `i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `i` ≤ 675. For each iteration, `n` and `k` were assigned values from the input split and converted to integers. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will have the values from the last input provided during the loop execution. The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 676 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 26 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 26 \). It then prints a string consisting of the first \( k \) characters of the alphabet, repeated \( n \) times. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it generates a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times. This approach fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are covered.

For example, consider the input `n=2` and `k=3`. The program will output `"abcabc"`, but this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`, `"bc"`, `"ca"`, `"cb"`, `"cc"`). Specifically, it lacks subsequences like `"aa"`, `"bb"`, etc., because the characters are repeated in a linear fashion rather than being interspersed to cover all combinations.

A correct solution would need to interleave the characters in a way that ensures all possible subsequences are covered, which is more complex than simply repeating the sequence.
