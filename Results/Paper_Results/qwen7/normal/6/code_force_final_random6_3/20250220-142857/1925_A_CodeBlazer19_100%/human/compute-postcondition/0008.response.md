Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` and `k` are input integers (their values do not change within the loop).

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `t` must remain within its bounds.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body and must still satisfy \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `t` must still be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.
