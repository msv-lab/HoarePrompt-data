Output State: **`x` must be at least 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `lst[b]` now contains the value `[a], a` and `b` are integers.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers entered by the user and splits them into `a` and `b`. It then converts these inputs to integers. The initial conditions for `x` and the list `lst` remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` must still be at least 2, `a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, and `lst[b]` now contains the value `[a]`. Additionally, `a` and `b` are explicitly stated to be integers.
