Output State: The loop will execute `x-1` times in total. After all iterations, `x` must be equal to the final value it was set to, which is at least 1 more than the number of times the loop runs. For each iteration, two integers `a` and `b` are entered by the user and appended to each other's lists in `lst`. Therefore, for every pair `(a, b)` entered, both `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` will contain each other as elements. The final state of `lst` will be a dictionary where each key (integer) points to a list containing all the keys that are connected to it through the pairs entered during the loop's iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will be the total number of iterations plus one, `a` and `b` will be the last two integers entered by the user, and `lst` will be a dictionary where each key has a list of all keys that are connected to it via the pairs entered during the loop.
