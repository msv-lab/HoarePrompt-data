Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it, and the first element of `lst[y]` is not an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
