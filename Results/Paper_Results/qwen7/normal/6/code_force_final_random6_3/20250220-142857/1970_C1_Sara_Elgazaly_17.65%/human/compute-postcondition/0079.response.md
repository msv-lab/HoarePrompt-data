Output State: **`s` is True, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `x` is equal to `y`, and `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` which is now empty.**

Explanation: The code `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. Since `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` which was previously popped from the list, `lst[y]` is now empty. The values of `s`, `a`, `b`, and the relationship between `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
