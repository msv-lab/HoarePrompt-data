Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

This means that the values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, while `x` and `y` are assigned the integer values obtained from the input split into two parts. The constraints on `u` and `v` also remain valid.
