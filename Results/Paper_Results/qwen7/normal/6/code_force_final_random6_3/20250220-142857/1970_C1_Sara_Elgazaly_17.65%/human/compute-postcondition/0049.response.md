Output State: **`s` remains False, `x` equals `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the popped element from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` now has one less element.**

Explanation: The code `y = lst[x].pop()` pops an element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to `y`. This changes the state of `lst[x]` by reducing its length by one. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
