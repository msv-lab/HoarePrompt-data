The loop condition is `lst[x]`, which means the loop will continue as long as `lst[x]` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `lst[x]` contained at least one element before the pop operation, and `y` was the last element popped from `lst[x]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[x]` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst[x]` is not empty.

State: **`s` is True, `x` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are the last two integers entered by the user, `y` is the last element popped from `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` must contain at least one element**
