Output State: **`x` must be at least 3, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `lst[b]` now contains the value `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers entered by the user and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. It does not affect the value of `x` or the list `lst`. Therefore, `x` remains at least 3, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user, and `lst[b]` now contains the value `[a, b]`.
