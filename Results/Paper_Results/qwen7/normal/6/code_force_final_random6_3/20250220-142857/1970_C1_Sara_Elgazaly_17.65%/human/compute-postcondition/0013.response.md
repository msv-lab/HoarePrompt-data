Output State: **`x` must be at least 3, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `lst[b]` now contains the value `[a, b, b, a]`**

Explanation: The code `lst[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list at index `b`. Initially, `lst[b]` contains `[a, b, b]`. After appending `a` to this list, `lst[b]` becomes `[a, b, b, a]`. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
