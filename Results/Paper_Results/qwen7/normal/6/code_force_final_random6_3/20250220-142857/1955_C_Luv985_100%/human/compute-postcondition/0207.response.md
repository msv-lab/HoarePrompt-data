Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r])`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi` if `a[r]` does not equal 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, and `t` is `k % 2` where we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
