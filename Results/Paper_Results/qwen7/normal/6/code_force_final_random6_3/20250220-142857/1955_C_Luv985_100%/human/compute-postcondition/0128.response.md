Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` must be 1, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is `ans + 1` if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0; `t` is updated to `k % 2`.**
