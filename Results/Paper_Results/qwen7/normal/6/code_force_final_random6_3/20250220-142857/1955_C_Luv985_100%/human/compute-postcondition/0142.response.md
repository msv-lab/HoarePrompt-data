Output State: **`k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` < `r`**.

This means that the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, while all other conditions and values remain as described in the initial state.
