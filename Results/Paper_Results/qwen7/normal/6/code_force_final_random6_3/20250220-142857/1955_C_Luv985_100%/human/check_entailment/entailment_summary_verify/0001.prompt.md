You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), followed by integers \( n \) and \( k \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ 10^15), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of operations needed to reduce all elements in the list \( a \) to zero, where each operation consists of subtracting the same positive integer from two elements of the list. If an element becomes zero during an operation, it is removed from consideration. The function returns nothing explicitly but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - It initializes pointers `l` and `r` to point to the first and last elements of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - If `mi * 2 <= k`, it reduces both `a[l]` and `a[r]` by `mi` and decreases `k` by `2 * mi`.
   - If either `a[l]` or `a[r]` becomes zero, it increments `ans` and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - If `mi * 2 > k`, it calculates the remaining attacks (`t = k % 2`) and checks if the current ship at `l` can be sunk with the remaining attacks. If so, it increments `ans` and breaks the loop.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the main loop, if `l == r`, it checks if the remaining attacks (`k`) can sink the last ship and increments `ans` if possible.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the total number of sunk ships `ans`.

### Testing with Provided Example

Let's test the program with one of the provided examples:

- **Test Case**: `n = 4`, `k = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - Initial state: `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - First attack: `a = [0, 2, 4, 2]` (sinks first ship, `ans = 1`)
  - Second attack: `a = [0, 2, 3, 1]` (sinks last ship, `ans = 2`)
  - Third attack: `a = [0, 1, 3, 0]` (sinks first ship, `ans = 3`)
  - Fourth attack: `a = [0, 0, 2, 0]` (sinks last ship, `ans = 4`)
  - Fifth attack: `a = [0, 0, 1, 0]` (sinks last ship, `ans = 5`)

The program correctly outputs `2` for this test case.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and testing it with the provided example, the program appears to handle the logic correctly according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
