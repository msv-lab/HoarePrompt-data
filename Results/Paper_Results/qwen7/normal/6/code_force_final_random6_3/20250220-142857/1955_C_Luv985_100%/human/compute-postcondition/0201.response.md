Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r-1])`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `mi` is recalculated as the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r-1])` since `r` has been decremented by 1.
