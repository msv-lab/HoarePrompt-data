Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is `ans + 1`; `l` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `l` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain in their updated states from the initial conditions.
