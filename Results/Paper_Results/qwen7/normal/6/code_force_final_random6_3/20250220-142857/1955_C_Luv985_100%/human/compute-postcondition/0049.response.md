Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is now `r - 1`, and `l` is increased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part, indicating that `a[r]` is checked against 0, and regardless of the outcome, the specified operations on `T`, `n`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `ans`, `l`, and `r` are performed.
