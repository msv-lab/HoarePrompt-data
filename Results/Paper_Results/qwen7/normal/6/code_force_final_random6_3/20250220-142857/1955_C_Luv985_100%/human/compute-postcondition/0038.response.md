Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0 or `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi` and `a[r]` remains unchanged, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` to 0, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1, and if `mi * 2 > k`, `k` is reduced to `k % 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
