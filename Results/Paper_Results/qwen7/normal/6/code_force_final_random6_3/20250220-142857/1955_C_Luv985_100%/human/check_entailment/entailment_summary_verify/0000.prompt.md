You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), followed by integers \( n \) and \( k \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ 10^15), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of operations needed to reduce all elements in the list \( a \) to zero, where each operation consists of subtracting the same positive integer from two elements of the list. If an element becomes zero during an operation, it is removed from consideration. The function returns nothing explicitly but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the logic for handling the attacks is flawed. Let's consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```

### Explanation:
The program attempts to reduce the durability of the first and last ships alternately until the durability of either ship reaches zero. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks because it does not account for the fact that once a ship sinks, it is no longer subject to further attacks.

In the given example:
1. Initially, `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`.
2. First attack: The first ship (durability 1) sinks, `a = [2, 4, 3]`.
3. Second attack: The last ship (durability 3) sinks, `a = [2, 4, 2]`.
4. Third attack: The first ship (durability 2) sinks, `a = [4, 2]`.
5. Fourth attack: The last ship (durability 2) sinks, `a = [4]`.

After four attacks, all ships have sunk, but the program incorrectly outputs 0.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the sinking of ships more accurately, ensuring that once a ship sinks, it is no longer considered in future attacks.
