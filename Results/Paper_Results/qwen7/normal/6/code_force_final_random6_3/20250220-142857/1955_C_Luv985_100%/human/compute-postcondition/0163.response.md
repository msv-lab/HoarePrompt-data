Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` to integers using map and lambda.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` to an integer using a lambda function and then creates a new list with these integer values. The variables `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
