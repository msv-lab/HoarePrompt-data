Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k` is `k - mi * 2` or remains greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `ans` is either `ans + 1` or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both possible paths through the conditional statement.
