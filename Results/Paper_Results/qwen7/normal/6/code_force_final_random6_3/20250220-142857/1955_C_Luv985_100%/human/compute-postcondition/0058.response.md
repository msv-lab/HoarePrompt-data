Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is greater than 0, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. Since `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is now reduced by this minimum value. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
