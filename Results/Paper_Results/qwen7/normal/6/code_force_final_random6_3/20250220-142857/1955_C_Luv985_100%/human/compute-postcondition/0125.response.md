Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 3`, `ans` is increased by 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is decreased by 1.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is adjusted to `n - 3` (decreased by 1). Otherwise, the original values of `r` remain as `n - 2`. All other variables retain their updated values as specified in the if part.
