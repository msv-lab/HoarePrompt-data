Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `T` is `T - 1`
   - `n` is an integer from the input
   - `k` is an integer from the input
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using `map` and `lambda`
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `ans` is 0

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `k` is `k > 0`

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For `l < r` to be true, `l` (which is 0) must be less than `r` (which is `n - 1`). Since `n` is an integer, `n - 1` should be greater than 0.
   - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure `r = n - 1` is greater than 0.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0**
