Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2 plus 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `min(a[0], a[r])`, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is set to 1, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`. If `a[l]` does not equal 0, no changes occur to the variables.
