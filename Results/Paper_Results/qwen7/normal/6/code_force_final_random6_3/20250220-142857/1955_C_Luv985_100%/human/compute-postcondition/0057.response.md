Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is greater than 0, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` decreases the value of `a[l]` by the value of `mi`. The other variables (`r`, `k`) remain unchanged. `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, which does not change since only `a[l]` is modified. `r` must be greater than `l` and `k` must be greater than 0, which are also unchanged by the code.
