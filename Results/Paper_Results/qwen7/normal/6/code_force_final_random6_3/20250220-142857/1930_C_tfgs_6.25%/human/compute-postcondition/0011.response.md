Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object with elements {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, ..., n: 1}; `i` is `n-1`; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` equals 2 for `0 â‰¤ i < n`**.

Explanation: The line `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a`. Since each element in the list `a` is calculated as `1 + (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `i + 2`, and given the range of `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the elements of `a` are `{2, 3, 4, ..., n+1}`. However, converting this list to a set and then back to a list removes the duplicates, leaving only the unique value `2` repeated `n` times. Therefore, the updated list `a` consists of `n` elements, all equal to `2`.
