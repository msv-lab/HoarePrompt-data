Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `2`, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1` and `a[n-1] - 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n`, `j` is `1`, and `ans` is a list with the element `a[n-1] - 1`, when `j` is incremented by 1 (becoming `2`), the new element added to `ans` is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, which simplifies to `a[n-1] - 2`. Therefore, `ans` now contains both `a[n-1] - 1` and `a[n-1] - 2`.
