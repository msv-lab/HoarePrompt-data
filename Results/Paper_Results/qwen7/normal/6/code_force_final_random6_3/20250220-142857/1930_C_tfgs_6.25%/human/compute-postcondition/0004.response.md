Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `a[0]` is 1 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `a[0]` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `a[0]` is 1**
