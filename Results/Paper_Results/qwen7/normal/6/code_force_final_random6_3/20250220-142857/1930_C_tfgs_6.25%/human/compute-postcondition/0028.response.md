Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `adv-1`, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains the values `a[n-2] - 2`, `a[n-2] - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`. If `i` is not greater than 0, the values of `i`, `j`, `adv`, `ans`, `cnt`, and `counter` remain unchanged.
