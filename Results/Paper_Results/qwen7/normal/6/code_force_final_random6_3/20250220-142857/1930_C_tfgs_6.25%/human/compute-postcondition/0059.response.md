Output State: **`adv` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `ans` is a list with three elements which are `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, and `a[i-1] - 2`, and `counter[a[i-1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The code decreases the value of `counter[a[i-1]]` by `adv`. Since `adv` is at least 3, `counter[a[i-1]]` is decreased by at least 3. The values of `adv`, `j`, `ans`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
