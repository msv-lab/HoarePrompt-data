### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - It modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it.
   - This ensures that each element in `a` is unique when inserted into the set `S` because `a[i] + i` guarantees uniqueness.

3. **Using `Counter` and Set:**
   - The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified value in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - This step ensures that the elements in `S` are unique and sorted in descending order.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted set `a` and constructs the final array `b` by ensuring the lexicographically largest possible values.
   - It handles the case where there are duplicate values by reducing the count of these values appropriately.
   - It ensures that the remaining elements are filled with the smallest possible values to maintain the lexicographical order.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the constructed array `b`.

### Verification:

- **Uniqueness and Sorting:** The program correctly ensures that each element in `S` is unique and sorted in descending order.
- **Handling Duplicates:** The program correctly handles duplicates by reducing their counts and filling the remaining positions with the smallest possible values.
- **Lexicographical Order:** The program ensures that the final array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
