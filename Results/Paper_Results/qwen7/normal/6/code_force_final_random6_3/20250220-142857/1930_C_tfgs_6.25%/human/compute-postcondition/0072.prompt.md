Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`, `adv` is `0`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in descending order, `cnt` is `0`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have been decremented below 0, as it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration. The variable `adv` will eventually become 0 because it is calculated as the minimum of three values, and as `i` reaches 0, the condition `i > 0` will no longer be met, preventing any further decrementing of `cnt` or updating of `counter`. The list `ans` will contain all elements from `a` in descending order, as each element of `a` is appended to `ans` exactly once during its respective iteration. Both `cnt` and `counter` will be 0 and empty, respectively, as they are continuously decremented and updated until their values reach 0 or there are no more elements to process.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1, `cnt` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 2, `cnt` is decreased by 1 and must be greater than 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
