Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, and `a[n-1] - 3`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `n` and `j` is `3`, `a[i - 1]` is `a[n - 1]`. Therefore, the new element appended to `ans` is `a[n - 1] - 3`. The original elements of `ans` remain unchanged.
