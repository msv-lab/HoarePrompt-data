Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input, which is within the specified range of 1 to 3 ⋅ 10^5.
