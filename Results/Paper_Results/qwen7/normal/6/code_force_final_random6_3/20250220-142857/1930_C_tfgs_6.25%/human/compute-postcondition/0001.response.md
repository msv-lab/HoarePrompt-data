Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, a is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
