Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The variable `t` retains its initial value `T`. The `input()` function reads a line of input from the user, and the `split()` method splits this line into a list of strings based on whitespace by default. This list is then assigned to the variable `info`.
