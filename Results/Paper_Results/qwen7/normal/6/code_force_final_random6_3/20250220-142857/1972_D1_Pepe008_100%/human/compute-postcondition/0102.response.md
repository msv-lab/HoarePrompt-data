Output State: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` is the final value it was set to during the loop's execution, `suma` is the sum calculated based on the loop's conditions, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is `a - (b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains `T`, `info` stays as the list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `b` takes its final value which is the upper limit of the range specified in the loop. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` plus one under certain conditions throughout the loop's iterations. Specifically, `suma` is incremented by `x + 1` if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` and by an additional `1` if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are true. The variable `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `b + 1`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for each iteration.
