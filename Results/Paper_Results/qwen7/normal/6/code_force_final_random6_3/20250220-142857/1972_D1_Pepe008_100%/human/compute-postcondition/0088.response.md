Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least `2`, `suma` is `x + 2`, `i` is `3`, `x` is `1`, the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is `a - 3**.

Explanation: The code `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. Since `suma` was initially `x + 1` and `x` is `1`, `suma` was `2`. After the increment, `suma` becomes `3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
