Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for t in range(T)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `t < T`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**: Since `t` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `t < T`, for the next iteration, `t` should be incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 0
- `info` remains unchanged
- `a` remains the first element of `info`
- `b` remains a positive integer greater than or equal to 4
- `suma` remains unchanged
- `i` remains `b + 1`
- `x` remains the last value calculated for `x` during the final iteration of the loop

For the next iteration of the loop, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**State:**
State: **`t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is the sum calculated after all iterations of the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, and `x` is the last value of `x` calculated within the loop, which is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1`, if `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b**2 + 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged and `x` is not incremented.**
