Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is an integer value from `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value from `info[1]`, `suma` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `suma` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `info`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
