Postcondition: `t` remains 0, `info` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` remains the first element of `info`, `b` must still be a positive integer, `suma` is `x + 2`, `i` is now 3, `x` is calculated as ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3, and if `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is greater than 0, then the condition holds as specified in the if part.
