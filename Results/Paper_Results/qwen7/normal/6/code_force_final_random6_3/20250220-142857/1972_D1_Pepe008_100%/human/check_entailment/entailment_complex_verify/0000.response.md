### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach than the intended solution. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   ```python
   T = int(input())
   for t in range(T):
       info = input().split()
       a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
       suma = 0
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes variables for each test case.

2. **Loop and Calculation:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, b + 1):
       x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
       if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
           suma += x
           if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
               suma += 1
   ```
   Here, the loop iterates from 1 to \(b\). The variable `x` is calculated using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). The conditions inside the loop are:
   - If \(x > 0\), `suma` is incremented by `x`.
   - If \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), `suma` is incremented by 1.

3. **Output:**
   ```python
   print(suma - 2)
   ```

#### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Incorrect Formula for `x`:**
   The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not correctly represent the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This formula seems to be an attempt to simplify the problem but does not align with the actual requirements.

2. **Conditions for Incrementing `suma`:**
   The conditions \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) do not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). These conditions are overly restrictive and do not cover all valid pairs.

3. **Lack of Correct Implementation:**
   The program does not correctly implement the logic to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a different heuristic that does not guarantee correctness.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
