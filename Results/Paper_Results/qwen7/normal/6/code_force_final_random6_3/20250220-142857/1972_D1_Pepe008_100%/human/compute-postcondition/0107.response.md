Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving these integers and prints the result minus 2. The function reads the number of test cases from the input, followed by pairs of integers for each test case. It ensures that the values meet certain constraints and performs calculations to determine the final sum, which is then outputted.**
