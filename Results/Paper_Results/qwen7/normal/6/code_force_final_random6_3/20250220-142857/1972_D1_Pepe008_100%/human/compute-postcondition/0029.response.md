Postcondition: `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info`, `b` must be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `suma` is `x + 2 + (a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 + 1`, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4, and the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are satisfied.
