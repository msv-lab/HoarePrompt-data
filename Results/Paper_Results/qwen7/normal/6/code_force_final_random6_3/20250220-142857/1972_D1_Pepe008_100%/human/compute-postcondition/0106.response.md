Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 are met and ensures that the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function then performs some unspecified operation (not detailed here) based on n and m and returns the result.**

Note: The specific operations to be performed on n and m are not detailed in the given information, so they are left unspecified in the functionality description.
