Postcondition: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 4, `suma` is `x + 3`, `i` is `4`, `x` is `a - 4 // 4`. This is because in the if part, the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is checked, and if true, `suma` is updated to `x + 3`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as per the if part.
