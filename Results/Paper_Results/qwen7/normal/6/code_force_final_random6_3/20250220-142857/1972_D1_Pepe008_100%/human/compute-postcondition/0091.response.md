Postcondition: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least `2`, `suma` is either `x + 2` or remains `0`, `i` is `3`, `x` is `1`, and the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i)` is `a - 3`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are both true, then `suma` is updated to `x + 2`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.
