Postcondition: `t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 4, `suma` is either `x + 3` or `0`, `i` is `4`, `x` is `a - 4 // 4`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` must be at least 4, and `suma` is updated to `x + 3` if the condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is true, otherwise `suma` remains `0`. The values of `i` and `x` are fixed as `4` and `a - 4 // 4`, respectively.
