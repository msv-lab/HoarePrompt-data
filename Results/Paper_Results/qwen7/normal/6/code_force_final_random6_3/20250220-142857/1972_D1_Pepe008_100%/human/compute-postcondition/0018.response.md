Output State: **`t` remains 0, `info` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` remains the first element of `info`, `b` must still be a positive integer, `suma` remains `x + 1`, `i` is now 3, `x` is calculated as ((a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1).**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated according to the formula \(x = (a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\), where `i` is now 3. So, `x` becomes \(((a - 3 \times (3 - 1)) // 3^2 + 1)\). All other variables remain in their previous states.
