Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, we read two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - It calculates \(x\) using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - If \(x\) is greater than 0, it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), and if so, adds 1 to `suma`.

### Key Issues:
1. **Formula for \(x\):**
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i(i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) does not correctly represent the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Consideration:**
   - The program does not consider the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd(a, b)\)) in the calculation, which is crucial for determining the valid pairs.

3. **Incorrect Condition Check:**
   - The condition check \((a - i(i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i(i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) is not relevant to the problem. These conditions do not help in finding the valid pairs.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
