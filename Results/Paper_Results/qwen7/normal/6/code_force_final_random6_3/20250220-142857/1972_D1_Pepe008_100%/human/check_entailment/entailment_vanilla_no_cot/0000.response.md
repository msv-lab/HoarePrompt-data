Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` using a loop that iterates from `1` to `b`. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions under which `suma` is incremented are incorrect.

2. **Conditions for Valid Pairs**: The problem requires that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The program does not check this condition properly. Instead, it uses a different approach that does not align with the problem statement.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program does not use the greatest common divisor (gcd) in its calculations, which is a crucial part of the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
