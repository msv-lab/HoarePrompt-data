Output State: **`t` is `T`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `info` is an integer `a`, `b` is a positive integer, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 1) // 1 + 1`, and the current value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given that `x` is defined as `(a - 1) // 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `a`, `suma` is updated to be `suma + a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
