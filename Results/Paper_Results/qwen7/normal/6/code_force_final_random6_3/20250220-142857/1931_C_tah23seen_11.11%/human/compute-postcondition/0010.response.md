To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `i <= j`.

Given the postcondition from the previous iteration:
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is either the length of `arr` minus 1 or the length of `arr` minus 2.
- If `i` is 1, then `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j]`.

We need to ensure that the condition `i <= j` holds true for the next iteration.

Let's analyze the possible values of `i` and `j`:

1. **If `i` is 0:**
   - `j` can be either `len(arr) - 1` or `len(arr) - 2`.
   - In both cases, `i <= j` will be true because `0 <= len(arr) - 1` and `0 <= len(arr) - 2`.

2. **If `i` is 1:**
   - `j` can be either `len(arr) - 1` or `len(arr) - 2`.
   - For `i <= j` to hold true, `j` must be `len(arr) - 1` (since `1 <= len(arr) - 1` but `1 > len(arr) - 2`).

Additionally, since the loop condition is `i <= j`, if `i` is 1, `j` must be `len(arr) - 1` to satisfy the condition for the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `j`.

State: **`i` must be 0 or 1, `j` must be the length of `arr` minus 1**
