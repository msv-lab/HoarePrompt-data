Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
   - Currently, `i` is 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1, which means `j` is a non-negative integer (since the length of any array is a non-negative integer).

4. **Check if the current state satisfies the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `i` will always be less than or equal to `j` as long as `j` is non-negative.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current state already satisfies the loop condition `i <= j` because `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1, which is a non-negative integer.
   - Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `i` or `j`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1**
