Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr` minus 2, and the value of `arr[i]` is equal to the value of `arr[j]`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, making it `j = (length of arr) - 2`. The values of `i` and the relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` remain unchanged.
