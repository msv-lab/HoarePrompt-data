Output State: `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be one less than `j`, and the element at index `i` will still be equal to the element at index `j`. The loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next element, effectively skipping over consecutive duplicates until it reaches the point where either `i` equals `j-1` or the elements no longer match.
