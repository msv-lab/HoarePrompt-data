Output State: **`i` is 0**

The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list of integers with a length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)), and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\). The code snippet initializes `i` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the length and contents of the list `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only updated variable is `i`, which is now set to 0.
