Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `j`. It simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The precondition that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` remains unchanged.
