Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns 0 if no valid sequence is found. Otherwise, it returns the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]`, with `i` being incremented to be one less than `j`. If no such sequence is found with `i` being incremented to be one less than `j`, it returns the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]` and `i` is less than `j-1`.**
