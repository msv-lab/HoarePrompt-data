#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The loop terminates when either `i` becomes greater than `j` or the condition `arr[i] != arr[j]` is met during an iteration.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and the condition `arr[i] == arr[j]` holds true
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be one less than `j`, and the element at index `i` will still be equal to the element at index `j`. The loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element is equal to the next element, effectively skipping over consecutive duplicates until it reaches the point where either `i` equals `j-1` or the elements no longer match.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between j and i plus 1, which is the length of the sequence where `arr[i]` equals `arr[j-1]` and `i` is incremented to be one less than `j`.
    #State: `i` is less than `j` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus one
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between j (which is the length of `arr` minus one) and i (which is less than j), given that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[j-1]`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0 or the length of a specific sequence within the list. If no valid sequence is found, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest sequence where the last element of the sequence matches the first element of the next sequence, with the second-to-last element of the sequence being one position before the start of the next sequence. If no such sequence exists, it returns the length of the sequence where the last element matches the second-to-last element of the list.
