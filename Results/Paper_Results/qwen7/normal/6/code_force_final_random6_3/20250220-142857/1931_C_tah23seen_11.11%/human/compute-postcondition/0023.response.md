Output State: **The loop terminates when either `i` becomes greater than `j` or the condition `arr[i] != arr[j]` is met during an iteration.**

In this final state, the values of `i` and `j` will satisfy one of the following conditions:
- `i > j`, indicating that the entire array has been checked without breaking the loop.
- The loop broke because `arr[i] != arr[j]` for some `i` and `j`.

The values of `i` and `j` will be such that they cannot be further adjusted within the loop without violating the loop's termination conditions. If the array is symmetric (palindromic) up to the point where the loop terminates, `i` will be just past the midpoint and `j` will be just before it. If the array is not symmetric, the loop will break as soon as it finds a mismatch.
