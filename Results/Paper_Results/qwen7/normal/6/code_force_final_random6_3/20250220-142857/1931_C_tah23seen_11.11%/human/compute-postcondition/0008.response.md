Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is either the length of `arr` minus 1 or the length of `arr` minus 2. Additionally, if `i` is 1, then `j` is the length of `arr` minus 2, and the value of `arr[i]` is equal to the value of `arr[j]`. If `i` is 0, then `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
