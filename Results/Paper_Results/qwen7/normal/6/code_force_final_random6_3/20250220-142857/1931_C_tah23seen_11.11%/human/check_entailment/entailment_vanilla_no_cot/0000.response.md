Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If it is, it returns 0. However, it does not handle the case where the array is not uniform and needs to be made uniform with exactly one operation.
2. The logic inside the function does not correctly identify the optimal segment to apply the operation. It only checks if the first and last elements are the same and then checks adjacent elements for uniformity, which is insufficient for determining the minimum cost.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should identify the first and last positions where the array elements differ and calculate the cost of making the segment between these positions uniform. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < j and arr[i] == arr[j]:
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    if i >= j:
        return 0
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for k in range(i, j + 1):
        cost = (j - i + 1)
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    return min_cost
```

This corrected function properly identifies the segment that needs to be made uniform and calculates the minimum cost for doing so.
