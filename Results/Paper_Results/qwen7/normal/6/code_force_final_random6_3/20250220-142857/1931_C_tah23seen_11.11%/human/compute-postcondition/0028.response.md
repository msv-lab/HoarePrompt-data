Output State: **`i` is less than `j`; `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial condition was that `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`, these conditions remain true after the increment, except that `i` has now been incremented by 1.
