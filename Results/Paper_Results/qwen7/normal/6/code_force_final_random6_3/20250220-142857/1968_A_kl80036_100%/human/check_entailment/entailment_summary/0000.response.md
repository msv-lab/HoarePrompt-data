Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the expression \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- The provided program simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each input \( x \).
- Let's analyze if this approach correctly maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\):
  - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\). Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x\).
  - We need to check if there exists any other \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y > x\).

However, since \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\), the sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) cannot be greater than \( x \) when \( y = x - 1 \). Any other \( y \) would either have a smaller \(\gcd(x, y)\) or a smaller \( y \), resulting in a sum less than or equal to \( x \).

Therefore, the program's approach is correct because \( y = x - 1 \) indeed gives the maximum possible value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Correctness: **True**
