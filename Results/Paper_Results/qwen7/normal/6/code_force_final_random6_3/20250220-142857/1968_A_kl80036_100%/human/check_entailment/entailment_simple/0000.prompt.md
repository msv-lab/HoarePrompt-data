Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `i` up to the value of `t` minus 1. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, `t` must still be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
    #- `i` will be set to `t - 1`.
    #- `t` remains within the range 1 to 1000.
    #- `x` will be the last integer input during the loop's execution.
    #- `y` will be `x - 1`.
