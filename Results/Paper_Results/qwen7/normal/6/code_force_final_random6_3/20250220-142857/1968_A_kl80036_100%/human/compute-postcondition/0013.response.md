Output State: The loop will execute `i` up to the value of `t` minus 1. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, `t` must still be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `y` will be `x - 1`.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `i` will be set to `t - 1`.
- `t` remains within the range 1 to 1000.
- `x` will be the last integer input during the loop's execution.
- `y` will be `x - 1`.
