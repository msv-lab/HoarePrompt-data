You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `i` up to the value of `t` minus 1. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, `t` must still be within the range 1 to 1000, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `y` will be `x - 1`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
    #- `i` will be set to `t - 1`.
    #- `t` remains within the range 1 to 1000.
    #- `x` will be the last integer input during the loop's execution.
    #- `y` will be `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `t` and `x`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000. The function does not return any value directly but implies that it might perform some operations or checks using these integers within its body.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
