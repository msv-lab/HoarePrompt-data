Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is decremented by 1, `bb` is a list of integers from the input, `cnt_aa` remains a Counter object counting the elements in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if the sum of the values in `D` (`tot`) is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` is 0, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `C` is now a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` but not in `D`, and `E` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of the values in dictionary `D`, `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` and `D[out_aa]` maintain their constraints based on the values of `C[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are adjusted accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is either decremented by 1 in `aa[:n - m]` (if the if condition is true) or `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 (if the else condition is true), `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
