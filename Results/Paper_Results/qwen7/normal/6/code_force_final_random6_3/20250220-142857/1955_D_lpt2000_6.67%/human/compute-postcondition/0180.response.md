Postcondition: **`aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]`, and if `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then either `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0 - 1 or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, then `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to -1.**
