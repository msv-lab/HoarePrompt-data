t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
