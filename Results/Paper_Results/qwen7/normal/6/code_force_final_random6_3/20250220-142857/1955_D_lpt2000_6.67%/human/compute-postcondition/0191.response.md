Postcondition: **`aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[in_aa]` and `D[out_aa]` maintain their constraints based on the values of `C[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are adjusted accordingly. Specifically, if `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` equals `C[in_aa]`, and `D[out_aa]` is adjusted based on the value of `D[out_aa]`. If `C[in_aa]` does not equal `D[in_aa]`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is adjusted based on the value of `D[out_aa]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 - 1 or `D[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and `C[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, then `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to -1.**
