Output State: **`aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, and `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. Given the initial postcondition that `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, after decrementing, `D[out_aa]` becomes less than or equal to -1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
