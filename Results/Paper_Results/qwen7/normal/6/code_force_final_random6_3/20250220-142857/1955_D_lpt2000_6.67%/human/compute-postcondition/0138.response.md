Output State: **`C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`, otherwise it is decreased by 2, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, if `C[in_aa] > 0`, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `C[out_aa] += 1` increases the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. The other conditions related to `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this line of code. The initial conditions for these variables still hold true.
