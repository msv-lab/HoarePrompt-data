State: **All elements in `D` are set to zero, `C` is empty, `tot` is 0, `fnd` is the total number of times the loop executed if `sum(D.values())` was greater than or equal to `k` during any iteration, otherwise `fnd` is the total number of iterations executed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `nabors` iterations.
- At the end of each iteration, `D` is modified by decrementing its values and `C` is modified by incrementing its values based on certain conditions.
- Since the loop runs for `nabors` iterations, after the last iteration, `D` will be empty (all elements set to zero), `C` will be non-empty (unless no conditions were met to increment it), `tot` will be 0 (since `D` is empty), and `fnd` will be the total number of iterations where the condition `sum(D.values()) >= k` was met.

Given the loop runs for `nabors` iterations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations executed, which is represented by `fnd`.

State: **All elements in `D` are set to zero, `C` is empty, `tot` is 0, `fnd` is the total number of times the loop executed if `sum(D.values())` was greater than or equal to `k` during any iteration, otherwise `fnd` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.**
