### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively selecting vertices based on their degrees and removing them from the set of remaining vertices. The path is constructed in descending order from the highest index `d` down to 0. This means it starts by querying the vertex with the highest degree and continues until all vertices are processed.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Query Strategy**: The program uses a descending order of degrees to query vertices. This strategy ensures that the vertex with the highest degree is queried first, which is a good starting point because high-degree vertices are more likely to be part of a Hamiltonian path.
2. **Vertex Removal**: When a vertex is selected, it is removed along with all its edges. This process continues until all vertices are processed.
3. **Path Construction**: The path is constructed by appending the selected vertices in the order they are removed. Since the graph is a complete graph minus exactly \( n-2 \) edges, a Hamiltonian path always exists.

#### Verification Against Example:
- **Example 1**: The graph has 4 vertices with edges (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3) removed.
  - Querying with `d = 3`: No vertex has a degree of 3, so "0 0" is returned.
  - Querying with `d = 2`: Vertices 1, 2, 3 have a degree of 2. Vertex 1 is selected (minimum degree), and vertex 4 is selected (minimum number not connected to 1).
  - Querying with `d = 1`: Vertices 2 and 3 have a degree of 1. Vertex 2 is selected (minimum number), and vertex 3 is selected (minimum number not connected to 2).
  - The path constructed is 4, 3, 1, 2, which is a Hamiltonian path.

- **Example 2**: The graph has 4 vertices with edges (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3) removed.
  - Querying with `d = 3`: Vertex 1 has a degree of 3 but is connected to all vertices, so "1 0" is returned.
  - Querying with `d = 2`: Remaining vertices 2, 3, 4 have a degree of 0. Vertex 4 is selected (minimum number), and vertex 2 is selected (minimum number not connected to 4).
  - The path constructed is 4, 1, 2, 3, which is a Hamiltonian path.

- **Example 3**: The graph has 2 vertices connected by an edge.
  - Querying with `d = 1`: Both vertices have a degree of 1. Vertex 2 is selected (minimum number), and vertex 1 is selected (minimum number not connected to 2).
  - The path constructed is 2, 1, which is a Hamiltonian path.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements a strategy to construct a Hamiltonian path within \( n \) queries. By querying vertices in descending order of their degrees and ensuring that the selected vertex is removed along with its edges, the program guarantees that a Hamiltonian path is constructed. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_2`.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
