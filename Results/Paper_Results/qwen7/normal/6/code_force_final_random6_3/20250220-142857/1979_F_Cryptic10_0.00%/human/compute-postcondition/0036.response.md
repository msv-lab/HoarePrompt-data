The loop condition in the given `while` statement checks if `remaining_vertices` is non-empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations.
- `remaining_vertices` is empty.
- `d` is -1.

Since `remaining_vertices` is empty, the loop will not execute again because the condition `remaining_vertices` is not satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` is empty, and `d` is -1**
