Output State: **`v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` as its last element, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Given that `v` is equal to `d - 3`, `path` will now include `v` as its last element. The values of `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are updated accordingly, while `d` and the function `func_1(d)` remain unchanged.
