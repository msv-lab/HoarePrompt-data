Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not guarantee finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph within \( n \) queries. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the graph is such that the removal of a vertex and its edges does not necessarily lead to a valid Hamiltonian path being constructed.

For instance, consider a graph with 4 vertices where edges (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3) are present, and the edge (1, 4) is removed. The graph would look like this:

```
1 -- 2
|    |
3 -- 4
```

In this case, if we start querying with higher degrees and removing vertices, we might not be able to construct a Hamiltonian path within the allowed number of queries. The program does not have a strategy to ensure that it will always find a Hamiltonian path by removing vertices in a way that guarantees the path's existence.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to implement a strategy that ensures the construction of a Hamiltonian path within \( n \) queries, which the current implementation does not provide.
