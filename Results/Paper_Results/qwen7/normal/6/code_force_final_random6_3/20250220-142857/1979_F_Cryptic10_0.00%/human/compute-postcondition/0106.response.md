Based on the initial state provided:

- `path` contains all vertices from 1 to n, added in descending order from the highest index `d` down to 0.
- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set since every vertex that was present initially has been removed from it and added to `path`.
- `d` is -1 after the loop completes, as the loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` and decrements `d` in each iteration until it reaches -1.

The `print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")` statement will join all elements of the `path` list into a single string with each element separated by a space and then print it prefixed with an exclamation mark "!".

Since `path` contains all vertices from 1 to n in descending order, the string will be a sequence of numbers starting from n down to 1, separated by spaces.

Output: **! n n-1 ... 2 1**
