Postcondition: **`d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.**
