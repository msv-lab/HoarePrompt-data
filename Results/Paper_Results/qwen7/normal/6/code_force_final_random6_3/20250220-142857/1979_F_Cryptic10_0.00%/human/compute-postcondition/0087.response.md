Postcondition: `d` is `n-2`, `v` is a vertex, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`. If `v` equals 0, then `u` is updated according to the condition in the if part.
