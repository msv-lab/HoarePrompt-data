Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` remains as `n-1`. If `v` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 2`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, then `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, then no changes are made to `remaining_vertices`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` as its last element but `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. This is because if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the loops or if statements are exited. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
