Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is a vertex present in the updated `remaining_vertices`, `path` now contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex `v`, and `remaining_vertices` has the vertex `v` removed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was being executed, but it does not change the values of the variables `d`, `v`, `path`, or `remaining_vertices`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
