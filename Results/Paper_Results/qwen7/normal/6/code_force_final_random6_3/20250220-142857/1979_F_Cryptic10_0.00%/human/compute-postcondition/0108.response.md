The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The function returns a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and `u` is the vertex that is not connected to `v` (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
