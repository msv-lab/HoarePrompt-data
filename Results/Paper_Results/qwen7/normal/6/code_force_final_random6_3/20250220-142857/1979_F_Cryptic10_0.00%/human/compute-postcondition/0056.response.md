Output State: **`path` contains `v`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `remaining_vertices` has had the vertex `v` removed from it.**

Explanation: The code removes the vertex `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The value of `v` remains unchanged and is still the return value of `func_1(d)`. The condition `if v == 0: continue` does not affect the removal of the vertex from the list.
