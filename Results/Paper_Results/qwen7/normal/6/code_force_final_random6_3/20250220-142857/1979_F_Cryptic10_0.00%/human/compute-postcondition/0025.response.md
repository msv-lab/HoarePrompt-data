Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning.
   - `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`.
   - `d` is `v - 2`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `d` in reverse order from `n-1` down to `0`.
   - The loop variable `d` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `d`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `d` was `v - 2`.
   - In the next iteration, `d` will be `v - 3`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `path` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted.
   - `d` will be `v - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 3`.**
