Output State: **`d` is `d - 2`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d - 1)`**.

This means that `d` has been decremented by 2, and the function `func_1` has been called with the argument `d - 1`, returning two values which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively.
