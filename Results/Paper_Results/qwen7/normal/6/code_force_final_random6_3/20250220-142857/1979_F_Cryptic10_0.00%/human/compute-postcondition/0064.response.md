Output State: **`d` is `d - 2`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, and `path` contains the value of `v` if `v` does not equal 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, and the condition to continue the loop is `v == 0`, if `v` is not 0, `v` is added to `path`. If `v` is 0, no change occurs in `path`. The values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged from their initial state.
