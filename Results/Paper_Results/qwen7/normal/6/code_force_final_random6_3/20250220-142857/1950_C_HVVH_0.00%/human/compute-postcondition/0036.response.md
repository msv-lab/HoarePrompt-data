Postcondition: `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, `day` becomes 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is updated to `h - 12` and `day` remains 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` and `h` remain unchanged.
