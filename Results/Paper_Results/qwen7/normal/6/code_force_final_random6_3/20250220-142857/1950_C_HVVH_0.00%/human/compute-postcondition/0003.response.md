Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes user input in the format of hours and minutes separated by a colon (e.g., "8:30"). This input is then split into two parts and converted to integers. The original variables `day` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `day` is still 'AM', and `n` must still be greater than 0. However, `h` and `m` are assigned the integer values of the hours and minutes from the input respectively.
