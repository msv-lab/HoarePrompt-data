Postcondition: `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `h` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is greater than 12, then `h` is adjusted to be 12 less than the original `h`, and `day` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is not greater than 12, `day` remains as 'PM' unless `h` equals 12, in which case `day` is set to 'AM'.
