Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `day = 'AM'`: This initializes the variable `day` to 'AM', which is correct for the start of the day.
   
2. **Reading Input**:
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the number of test cases.
   - The loop runs `n` times, processing each test case one by one.
   
3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `(h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))`: This correctly splits the input string `hh:mm` into hour (`h`) and minute (`m`), converting them to integers.
   
4. **Determining AM/PM**:
   - If `h == 0`, it sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'. This is correct because 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM.
   - If `h > 12`, it subtracts 12 from `h` and sets `day` to 'PM'. This is correct because any hour greater than 12 in 24-hour format needs to be adjusted by subtracting 12 to convert to 12-hour format.
   - Otherwise, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' and checks if `h` is 12 to switch between AM and PM. This logic is flawed because:
     - For `h == 12`, it should be 'PM'.
     - For `h < 12`, it should be 'AM'.

### Correct Logic for Determining AM/PM:
- If `h == 0`, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h > 12`, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, set `day` to 'AM' if `h < 12` and 'PM' if `h == 12`.

### Revised Code:
```python
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has an issue with the logic for determining whether the time is in the AM or PM period. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
