Output State: `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list, `[arr[len(arr) - 1] + sum(arr[2:])`, or any combination of sums and indices derived from the elements of `arr`, `max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum found during the loop, which could be any of the possible segments derived from the elements of `arr`, `segments_variants` is a list containing all the segments that were considered as potential candidates for the maximum sum, `i` is `len(arr)`, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `max_sum` will still be -1 (since it was never updated), `new_segment` will be either an empty list or a list representing the last segment considered, `max_segment` will contain the start and end indices of the segment with the highest sum found throughout the array, `segments_variants` will include all segments that were evaluated, and `i` will be equal to the length of the input array `arr`.
