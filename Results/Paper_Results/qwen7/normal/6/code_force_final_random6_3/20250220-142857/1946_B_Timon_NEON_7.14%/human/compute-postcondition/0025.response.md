Postcondition: `max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] or [arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` or an empty list, `i` is either 2 or 3, `arr` is a non-empty list.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `max_sum` remains -1. `new_segment` can either remain an empty list or be a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`. `max_segment` can be [0, 0], [1, 0], or [arr[1], 0]. `segments_variants` can contain `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `[new_segment + [i - 1]]` or be an empty list. The value of `i` can be either 2 or 3, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.
