Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns a list `total_max_segment` containing the segment with the maximum sum among all the segments found in `segments_variants`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it is set to [-1].**
