Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either [arr[3], 3] or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [1 + arr[1], 0], [1 + arr[3], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0], `segments_variants` becomes either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], or an empty list plus `[new_segment + [4]]`, `i` is 6, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The line `segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])` appends a new segment to `segments_variants`. Given that `i` is 5 initially, `i - 1` evaluates to 4. Therefore, `new_segment` (which can be either `[arr[3], 3]` or `[arr[4] + arr[2], 2]`) is appended to the list `[4]`. This results in either `[new_segment + [4]]` being added to `segments_variants`. The other variables remain unchanged.
