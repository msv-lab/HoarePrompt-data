Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The operations do not change the sum of the array but can rearrange elements to potentially increase the overall sum.

### Given Code Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   ```python
   def func_1(number):
       return number % 1000000007
   ```
   This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   ```python
   def func_2(arr):
       new_segment = []
       max_segment = [0, 0]
       segments_variants = []
       max_sum = -1
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           if new_segment:
               if arr[i] < 0:
                   if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                   else:
                       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                       max_segment = new_segment
                   new_segment = []
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
               else:
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                   new_segment[0] += arr[i]
           else:
               if arr[i] >= 0:
                   new_segment = [arr[i], i]
               max_segment[0] += arr[i]
       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       total_max_segment = [-1]
       for segment in segments_variants:
           if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
               total_max_segment = segment
       if len(total_max_segment) == 1:
           total_max_segment = [-1]
       return total_max_segment
   ```

   - **Purpose:** This function seems to be intended to find the segment with the maximum sum. However, it has several issues:
     - The function does not actually compute the maximum sum of any segment.
     - It appends segments to `segments_variants` without properly calculating their sums.
     - It returns a segment index, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   ```python
   def func_3(number, quantity):
       answer = 0
   ```
   This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Conclusion
The given code does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in `func_2`, which is supposed to find the segment with the maximum sum but fails to do so. Additionally, the functions `func_1` and `func_3` are either unnecessary or incomplete.

### Correctness
Given the analysis, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
