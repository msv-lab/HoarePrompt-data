Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_segment` becomes either [2 + arr[1], 0], [2 + arr[3], 0], or [2 + arr[4], 0], `segments_variants` becomes either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], [max_segment + [4]], or an empty list plus [new_segment + [4]], `i` is 7, and `arr` remains a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 6, `max_segment[0]` is updated to `1 + arr[1] + arr[6]`, which simplifies to `2 + arr[1]` (since `1 + arr[1]` was the original value). This applies similarly for the other cases where `max_segment` could be `[1 + arr[3], 0]` or `[1 + arr[4], 0]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 7.
