Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`, `max_segment` is either [0, 0] or [1, 0] or [arr[1], 0], `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2], 2]` or an empty list, `i` is 4, `arr` is a non-empty list**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment to `segments_variants`. The new segment is `new_segment + [i - 1]`, which translates to `new_segment + [3]` since `i` is 3. Given the initial state, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is increased by `arr[2]`. Therefore, the updated `segments_variants` will include the new segment `[3]` appended to the existing segments. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 to become 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
