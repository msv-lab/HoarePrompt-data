Postcondition: `total_max_segment` is the list that was either updated to `segment` or retained its original value, and `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.
