Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either [arr[3] + arr[5], 3] or [arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [1 + arr[1] + arr[5], 0], [1 + arr[3] + arr[5], 0], or [1 + arr[4] + arr[5], 0], `segments_variants` remains either [0, 0, 2], [new_segment + [2]], or an empty list, `i` is 7, `arr` remains a non-empty list, `max_segment[0]` is `1 + arr[1] + arr[7]` or `1 + arr[3] + arr[7]` or `1 + arr[4] + arr[7]`**

Explanation: The code `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of `new_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. Given that `i` was 5, it now becomes 7. The specific values of `new_segment` and `max_segment[0]` are updated based on the initial conditions provided.
