Output State: **`max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either an empty list, [arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], n-1], [arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 2], [arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 5], or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [2 + arr[1] + arr[3] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [2 + arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[1] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[4] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0] or [1 + arr[3], 0], `segments_variants` becomes a list containing all possible valid segment variants found during the loop execution, `i` is n (where n is the length of `arr`), and `max_segment` is appended to `segments_variants` as [max_segment[0] + arr[-1], max_segment[1]], and `arr` remains a non-empty list.**

In natural language, this means that the `segments_variants` list now includes the current `max_segment` updated to include the last element of `arr`. All other variables remain in their previous states, with `max_sum` unchanged, `new_segment` and `max_segment` reflecting the last computed segment sums, and `i` set to the length of `arr`.
