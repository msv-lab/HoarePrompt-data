Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` becomes either an empty list, [arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], n-1], [arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 2], [arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 5], or [arr[4] + arr[2], 2], `max_segment` becomes either [2 + arr[1] + arr[3] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [2 + arr[4] + arr[2] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[1] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[3] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[4] + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], [1 + arr[5] + ... + arr[n-1], 0], or [1 + arr[4], 0] or [1 + arr[3], 0], `segments_variants` becomes a list containing all possible valid segment variants found during the loop execution plus the new_segment + [len(arr) - 1], `i` is n (where n is the length of `arr`), and `max_segment` is appended to `segments_variants` as [max_segment[0] + arr[-1], max_segment[1]], and `arr` remains a non-empty list; `total_max_segment` is set to [-1]
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total_max_segment` and `segment` are lists. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`, and `segment` retains its original values. If `total_max_segment[0]` is not less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` and `segment` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_max_segment` and `segment` are lists. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`, and `segment` retains its original values. If `total_max_segment[0]` is not less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` and `segment` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total_max_segment` is the list that was either updated to `segment` or retained its original value, and `segment` is the next element in `segments_variants`. If `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
