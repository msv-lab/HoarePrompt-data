Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is [arr[0], 0], `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code assigns `[arr[i], i]` to `new_segment`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 0, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[0], 0]`. The values of `max_sum`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `i` (which is incremented to 1) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, which is still true since `i` is now 1.
