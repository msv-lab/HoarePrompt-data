Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is a list where the first element is increased by `arr[4]`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2, 2]` or `[new_segment + [2], 2]` or an empty list, `i` is 5, `arr` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `max_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. Given that `i` was 4, it now becomes 5. The value of `max_sum` remains -1, `new_segment` remains an empty list, and `segments_variants` remains unchanged as well. The first element of `max_segment` is now increased by `arr[4]`.
