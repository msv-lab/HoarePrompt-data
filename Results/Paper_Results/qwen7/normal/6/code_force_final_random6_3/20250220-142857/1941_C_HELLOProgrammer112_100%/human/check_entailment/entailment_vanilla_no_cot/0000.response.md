Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The logic in the code counts occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate through the string and check for the presence of "pie" and "map". When either of these substrings is found, we should skip the characters that form these substrings to ensure they are removed.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if 'pie' in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find('pie')
                deletions += start
                i += start + 3  # Skip past 'pie'
            elif 'map' in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find('map')
                deletions += start
                i += start + 3  # Skip past 'map'
            else:
                break
        
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This solution iterates through the string and finds the first occurrence of "pie" or "map". It then skips the characters forming these substrings and increments the deletion count accordingly. This ensures the minimum number of deletions is performed to make the string beautiful.
