Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer + 1, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input integer, which is specified to be 1 less than the value at the end of the previous iteration. Since no previous iteration value is mentioned, we assume the input integer is `a + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
