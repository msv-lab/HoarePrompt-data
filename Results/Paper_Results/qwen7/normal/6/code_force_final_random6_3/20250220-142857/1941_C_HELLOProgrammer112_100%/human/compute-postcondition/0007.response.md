Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - Since `_` is a placeholder and does not hold any state, we do not need to adjust it.
   - The value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run. After each iteration, this value decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
   - `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The only thing that changes with each iteration is the value of `int(input())`, which is used to control the loop.
   - After one iteration, the value of `int(input())` will decrease by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `t` remains the same as it was not involved in the loop head.
- `a` remains the same as it was not involved in the loop head.
- `s` remains the same as it was not involved in the loop head.
- `x` remains the same as it was not involved in the loop head.
- `y` remains the same as it was not involved in the loop head.
- `z` remains the same as it was not involved in the loop head.
- The value of `int(input())` will be decreased by 1.

Given that the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop counter has decreased by 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`, `int(input())` must be 1 less than the value at the end of the previous iteration**.
