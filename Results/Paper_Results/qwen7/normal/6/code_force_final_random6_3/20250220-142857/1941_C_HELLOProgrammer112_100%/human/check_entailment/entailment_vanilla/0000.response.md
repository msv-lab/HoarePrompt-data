Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
   - It also counts the occurrences of the substring "mapie".

3. **Calculating Minimum Deletions:**
   - The formula used to calculate the minimum deletions is `x + y - z`, where:
     - `x` is the count of "map".
     - `y` is the count of "pie".
     - `z` is the count of "mapie".
   - The logic behind this formula is that every occurrence of "mapie" is counted twice (once as "map" and once as "pie"), so we subtract `z` to avoid double-counting.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider an example to see if the formula works correctly:

- **Test Case:**
  - `s = "mmapnapie"`
  - `x = s.count('map') = 2`
  - `y = s.count('pie') = 1`
  - `z = s.count('mapie') = 1`

- **Calculation:**
  - `x + y - z = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2`

- **Expected Output:**
  - We need to remove the 4th and 9th characters to make the string "mmapnapie" beautiful.
  - So, the expected output is `2`.

However, the program prints `2`, which matches our expectation.

### Edge Cases:

- **Case with "mapie":**
  - If the string contains "mapie", it should be removed only once.
  - For example, in "mapie", `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`, so `x + y - z = 1`.

- **Case with no "map" or "pie":**
  - If the string does not contain "map" or "pie", `x = 0` and `y = 0`, so `x + y - z = 0`.

- **Case with multiple "map" and "pie":**
  - For example, in "mmappie", `x = 2`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`, so `x + y - z = 2`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The formula `x + y - z` accurately accounts for the overlapping counts of "map" and "pie".

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
