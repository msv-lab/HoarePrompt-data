Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the new input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the count of 'mapie' in `s`, `y` is updated to the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `y = s.count('pie')` updates the variable `y` to the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
