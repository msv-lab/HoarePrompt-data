Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer + 1, `s` is an updated input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `z` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `a`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `s` is the input provided by the user.
