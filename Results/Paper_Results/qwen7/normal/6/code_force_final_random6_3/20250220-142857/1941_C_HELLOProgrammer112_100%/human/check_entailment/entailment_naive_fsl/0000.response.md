Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping substrings or the need to remove characters to avoid both "map" and "pie" simultaneously. For example, in the input "mappie", the program would count 2 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a deletion count of 3, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 2, as deleting the 3rd and 5th characters ("ap") would make the string beautiful.
