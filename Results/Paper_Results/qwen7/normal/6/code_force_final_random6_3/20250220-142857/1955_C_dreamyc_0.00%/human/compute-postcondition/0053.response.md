Postcondition: `k` must be non-zero; `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * x`, and `nums` is updated such that the last element `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged, and `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements.
