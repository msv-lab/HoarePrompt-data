Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `k` remains non-zero, `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, `k` remains non-zero as per the initial condition, and `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements than before. The value of `a` does not affect `k` or `nums` directly, but since the postcondition mentions that if `a > 0`, then `k` remains unchanged and `nums` is updated with the new leftmost element `a`, and since the code only increments `ans` without involving `a`, the values of `k` and `nums` remain as per their initial conditions with respect to the given postcondition.
