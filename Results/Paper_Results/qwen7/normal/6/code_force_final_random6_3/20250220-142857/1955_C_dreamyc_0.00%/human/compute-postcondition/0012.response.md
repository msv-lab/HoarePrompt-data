Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `k` is less than \(2 \times x\). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the only effect is that the program exits the current loop or conditional structure. All other variables retain their original values as per the initial state.
