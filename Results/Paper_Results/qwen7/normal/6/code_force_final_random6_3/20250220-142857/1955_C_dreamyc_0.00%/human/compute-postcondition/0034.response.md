Output State: **`k` is a non-zero integer - 2 * x, `a` is `a - x`, `b` is `b - x`, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * x`. The value of `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are decreased by `x`. The initial state of `k` being a non-zero integer remains unchanged except for the subtraction of `2 * x`.
