Output State: **`k` is non-zero, `nums` is a deque with one more element than before, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a <= 0`, otherwise `nums` is updated with the new leftmost element `b`.**

Explanation: The code `nums.append(b)` appends the value `b` to the right end of the deque `nums`. Since `nums` originally had two fewer elements after some operations, appending `b` increases its length by one. The value of `k` remains unchanged as no condition related to `k` is met by this operation. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 because the condition `a > 0` was not checked and thus the increment applies.
