Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` must be non-zero, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of the deque before popping, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

The code assigns the value of the minimum between `a` and `b` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
