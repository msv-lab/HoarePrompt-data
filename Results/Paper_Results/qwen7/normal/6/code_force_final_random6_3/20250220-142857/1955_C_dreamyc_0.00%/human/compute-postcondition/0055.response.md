Output State: **`k` must be non-zero; `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements; `nums` is updated with the new leftmost element `a`; `k` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the value `a` to the left end of the deque `nums`. This operation does not affect the value of `k`, which remains non-zero and unchanged. Additionally, `nums` is updated to have two fewer elements than before, and now includes the new leftmost element `a`.
