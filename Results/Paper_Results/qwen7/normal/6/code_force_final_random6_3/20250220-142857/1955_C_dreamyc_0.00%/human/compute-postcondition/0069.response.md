The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.

- Case_1: During the loop's execution, the function counts the number of times `b` (which is derived from elements in `nums` and `k`) is found to be non-positive and returns this count plus 1.
- Case_2: If no operations have been performed to change the value of `ans`, which starts at 0, the function returns `ans`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`, and return the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1, unless no operations have been performed, in which case it returns 0.
