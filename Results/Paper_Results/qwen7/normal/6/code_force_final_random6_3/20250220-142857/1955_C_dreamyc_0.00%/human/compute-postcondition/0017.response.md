Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-zero integer, `nums` is a deque with one more element than before (now containing `n` elements), `ans` is 0, `a` is the new first element of the deque, `b` is the last element of the deque before popping, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k` is greater than or equal to \(2 \times x\), `k` is decreased by \(2 \times x\), and `b` is decreased by `x`. If `k` is less than \(2 \times x\), `k` remains unchanged. Additionally, `a` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `nums.appendleft(a)` appends the value of `a` to the left end of the deque `nums`. This increases the number of elements in `nums` by one. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `b`, `x`, and the condition regarding `a` remain unchanged.
