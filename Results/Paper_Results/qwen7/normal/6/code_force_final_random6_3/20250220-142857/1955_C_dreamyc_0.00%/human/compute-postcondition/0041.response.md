Postcondition: `k` is a non-zero integer, `a` is the first element of `nums` after removing the leftmost element, `b` is the last element of `nums` after removing the rightmost element, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `k` is reduced by 2 times `x`, and both `a` and `b` are reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`. Additionally, if `a` is not greater than 0, `ans` is increased by 1.
