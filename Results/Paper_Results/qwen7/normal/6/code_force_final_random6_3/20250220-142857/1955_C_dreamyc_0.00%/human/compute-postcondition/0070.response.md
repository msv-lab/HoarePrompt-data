Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns the total number of times `b` was found to be non-positive during the loop's execution plus 1, or returns 0 if no operations have been performed to change its value.**
