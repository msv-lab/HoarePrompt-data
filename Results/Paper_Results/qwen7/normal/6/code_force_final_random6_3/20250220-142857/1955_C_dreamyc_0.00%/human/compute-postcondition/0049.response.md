Output State: **`k` must be non-zero; `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements; `a` is `a` minus `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is decremented by `x`, which is the minimum of the first element `a` and the last element `b` of the original `nums`. The values of `k`, `nums`, and `b` remain unchanged.
