Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `x` remains the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` simply increments the value of `ans` by 1. There are no conditions or changes applied to `k`, `a`, `b`, or `x`. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state, except for `ans`, which is now increased by 1.
