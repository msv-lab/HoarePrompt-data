Output State: **`k` must be non-zero; `nums` is a deque with two fewer elements, `a` is the first element of the original `nums`, and `b` is the last element of the original `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()` removes the first element from the deque `nums` and assigns it to `a`, then removes the last element from `nums` and assigns it to `b`. The conditions that `k` must be non-zero and `len(nums)` must be at least 2 are still valid. After executing the code, `nums` will have at least 0 elements (if it had exactly 2 elements initially), and `a` and `b` will hold the first and last elements of the original `nums`, respectively.
