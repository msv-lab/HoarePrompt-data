Output State: **`a` is the element at index `x` in list `l`, `b` is infinity, `c` is 3, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, making it 3 (since `c` was either 2 or 1 initially). The other variables (`a`, `b`, `l`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
