Output State: **`x` is 0, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the value of `l[0]`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `b`. Given that `x` is 0, `b` is now set to the value of `l[0]`. The values of `x`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
