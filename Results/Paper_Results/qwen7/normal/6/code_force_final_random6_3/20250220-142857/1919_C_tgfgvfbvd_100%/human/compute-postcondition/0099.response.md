Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `a` and `b` to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
