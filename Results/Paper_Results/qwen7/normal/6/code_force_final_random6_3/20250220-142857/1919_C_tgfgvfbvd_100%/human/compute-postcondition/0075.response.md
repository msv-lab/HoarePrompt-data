Output State: **`a` and `b` are both infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n`, `b` is the `x`-th element of `l`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the `x`-th element of the list `l` to the variable `b`. Since `x` is equal to `n`, `b` is set to the `n`-th element of the list `l`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l` are updated accordingly, while `x` remains unchanged as it is referenced from `n`.
