Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be equal to `n-1`.
- `a` will be the minimum value in the list `l`.
- `b` will be the second minimum value in the list `l` if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise `b` will be positive infinity.
- `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`)**
