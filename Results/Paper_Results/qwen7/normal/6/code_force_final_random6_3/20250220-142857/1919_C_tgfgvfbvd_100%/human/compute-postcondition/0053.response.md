Output State: **`a` is set to infinity, `b` is set to infinity, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n-1`, `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are strictly greater than `b`, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code sets `a` and `b` to infinity (`float('inf')`). The values of `n`, `x`, `c`, and the list `l` remain unchanged from their initial state.
