Postcondition: `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n`, and since the condition `a > b` is always false (both `a` and `b` are infinity), the program does not change the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
