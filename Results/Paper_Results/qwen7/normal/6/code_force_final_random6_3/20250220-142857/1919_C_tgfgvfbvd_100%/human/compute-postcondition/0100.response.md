Output State: **`c` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is positive infinity, `b` is positive infinity.**

The code initializes `c` to 0, which is a new assignment. The values of `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
