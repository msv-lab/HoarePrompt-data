Output State: `k` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value encountered during the loop (i.e., the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration), `cur` is the final value of `cur` after the last iteration (i.e., `cur + a[s]` for the last iteration), `vis[s]` is 1, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `mx` will hold the highest value between its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration. `cur` will be the final value it takes after the last iteration, which is `cur + a[s]`. `vis[s]` will be marked as 1 because it is set to 1 in the first line of the loop. Finally, `s` will be updated to `p[s]` for the last iteration, meaning it will hold the value of `p[s]` after the loop ends.
