You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array a, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, and k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value encountered during the loop (i.e., the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration), `cur` is the final value of `cur` after the last iteration (i.e., `cur + a[s]` for the last iteration), `vis[s]` is 1, and `s` is updated to `p[s]` for the last iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `mx` will hold the highest value between its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration. `cur` will be the final value it takes after the last iteration, which is `cur + a[s]`. `vis[s]` will be marked as 1 because it is set to 1 in the first line of the loop. Finally, `s` will be updated to `p[s]` for the last iteration, meaning it will hold the value of `p[s]` after the loop ends.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for each iteration, with `k` being 0, `cur` holding the final value after the last iteration (`cur + a[s]`), `vis[s]` marked as 1, and `s` holding the value of `p[s]` after the loop ends.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers `p`, a list of integers `s`, and a positive integer `k`. It iterates through the list `s` based on the permutation `p`, updating the maximum value `mx` and the current sum `cur` until `k` reaches 0. After completing the iterations, it returns the maximum value between `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]` for the last iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not account for the possibility of moving to `p_s` and `p_pb` during each turn. Instead, it only considers staying at the current position or moving to `p_s` or `p_pb` once per turn, which does not accurately reflect the rules of the game.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected output:
```
Bodya
```

However, the provided program will incorrectly calculate the scores and determine the result. The correct implementation should consider all possible moves for each player in each turn, including the option to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the permutation.
