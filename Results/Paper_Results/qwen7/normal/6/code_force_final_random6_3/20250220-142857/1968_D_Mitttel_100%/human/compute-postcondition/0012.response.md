Output State: **`mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `vis[s]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line of code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `cur + k * a[s]`. The value of `vis[s]` remains unchanged and is still 1. The initial condition that `k` is greater than 0 is also preserved.
