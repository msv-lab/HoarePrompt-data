Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for _ in range(remainder_steps):`. The only variable involved here is `remainder_steps`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`.
   - `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.
   - `cycle_pos` remains unchanged.
   - `cycle_score` remains unchanged.
   - `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`.
   - `current_pos` remains unchanged.
   - `steps` remains unchanged.
   - `visited` dictionary remains unchanged.
   - `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will execute as long as `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `remainder_steps`, we need to ensure that `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
