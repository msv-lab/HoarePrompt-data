Output State: `full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps - remainder_steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + remainder_steps * a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]` repeated `remainder_steps` times, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged.

In this final output state, the variable `full_cycles` remains the same as it was calculated before the loop started. The `remaining_steps` is reduced by the number of steps executed within the loop, which is equal to `remainder_steps`. The `score` is incremented by the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each step within the loop, which is `remainder_steps` times. The `current_pos` is updated multiple times according to the rule `current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]` for each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`cycle_pos`, `cycle_score`, `steps`, `visited`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
