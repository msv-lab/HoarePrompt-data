### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compares their scores.
- The logic is straightforward and correct if `calculate_score` works as expected.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
- It handles cycles within the permutation to optimize the calculation for long-term scores.
- The function correctly accounts for the cycle detection and scoring within the cycle.
- The logic for handling cycles and remaining steps is sound.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
- It reads the input data, extracts necessary parameters, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The function correctly handles the input format and prints the results.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring**:
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly identifies cycles in the permutation.
   - It calculates the score for the initial segment before entering the cycle.
   - It accurately calculates the score for the remaining steps using the cycle length and score.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads input efficiently and processes it correctly.
   - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as when the permutation has no cycles or when `k` is very large.
   - The program correctly handles these cases by simulating the game for the required number of steps.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct. The functions handle the logic for calculating scores and determining the winner appropriately. There are no apparent issues or logical flaws in the provided code.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
