Output State: `index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `index` will have advanced by the total amount required for all iterations, which is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n. The variable `t` will have been decremented by the number of iterations minus one (since it starts at the number of iterations and decreases by one each time). The `results` list will contain the return values from `func_1` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `PB`, `k`, and `PS` will be updated based on their positions in the `data` list after the last iteration, and `p` and `a` will be lists of integers derived from the `data` list as described.
