Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a; the function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to input.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, or `a`. It only changes how the `input` function is referred to in the program.
