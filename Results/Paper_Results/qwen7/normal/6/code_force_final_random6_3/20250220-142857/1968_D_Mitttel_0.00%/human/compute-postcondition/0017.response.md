Output State: **`index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])**.

The code appends the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending the return value, `results` now contains one element, which is the return value of the function call. All other variables retain their initial states except for `results`.
