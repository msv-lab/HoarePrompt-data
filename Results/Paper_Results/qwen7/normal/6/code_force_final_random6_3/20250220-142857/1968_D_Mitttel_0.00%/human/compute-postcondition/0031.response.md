Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `index` is 17 + 3 * n
   - `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new element `result`
   - `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`
   - `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`
   - `n` is `int(data[index])`
   - `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `t`, we need to update `t` to `t - 1` (as given).
   - All other variables (`index`, `PB`, `results`, `k`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 1 - 1` (or `t - 2`), `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the new element `result`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is `int(data[index])`**
