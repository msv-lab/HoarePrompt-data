Output State: **`index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from index to index + n converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a list `p` by converting each element in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into an integer using the `map` function. The other variables remain unchanged.
