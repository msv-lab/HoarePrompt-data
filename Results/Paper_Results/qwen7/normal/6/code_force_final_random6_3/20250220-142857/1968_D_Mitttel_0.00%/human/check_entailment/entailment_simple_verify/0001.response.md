### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the winner or a draw.
- **Logic**: Correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores.
- **Correctness**: The logic is straightforward and correct if `calculate_score` works as expected.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- **Purpose**: Calculates the score for a given starting position.
- **Logic**:
  - Simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
  - Detects cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation for long-term scores.
  - Handles cycles by calculating the score for the initial segment before entering the cycle and then using the cycle length and score for the remaining steps.
- **Correctness**:
  - The cycle detection logic is correct.
  - The score calculation for the initial segment and the cycle is accurate.
  - The handling of remaining steps outside the cycle is sound.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the input data efficiently.
  - Extracts necessary parameters for each test case.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
- **Correctness**:
  - The input handling is efficient and correct.
  - The processing of multiple test cases is handled correctly.
  - The printing of results follows the required format.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring**:
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly identifies cycles in the permutation.
   - It calculates the score for the initial segment before entering the cycle.
   - It accurately calculates the score for the remaining steps using the cycle length and score.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads input efficiently and processes it correctly.
   - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as when the permutation has no cycles or when `k` is very large.
   - The program correctly handles these cases by simulating the game for the required number of steps.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, the implementation appears to be correct based on the problem description. The functions handle the logic for calculating scores and determining the winner appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
