Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The `calculate_score` function accurately calculates the score for a given starting position by considering cycles in the permutation.
3. The `func_1` function compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
4. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the correct winner is determined based on the scores calculated by `calculate_score`.

Given the detailed state analysis and the correctness of the functions involved, the overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
