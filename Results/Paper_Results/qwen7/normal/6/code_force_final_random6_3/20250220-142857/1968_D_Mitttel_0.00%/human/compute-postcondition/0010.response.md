Output State: **`index` is 9, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`.**

Explanation: The code `PS = int(data[index + 3])` updates the value of `PS` by converting the element at index `index + 3` of the `data` list to an integer. Given that `index` is initially 6, `index + 3` equals 9. Therefore, `PS` is assigned the integer value from `data[9]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
