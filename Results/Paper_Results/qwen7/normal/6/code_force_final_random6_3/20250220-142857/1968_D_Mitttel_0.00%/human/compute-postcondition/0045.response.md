Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head in the given code is `for result in results:`.
   - The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `result`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `result`:**
   - The initial value of `result` is not specified directly in the given state before the loop. However, we know that `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
   - Therefore, `result` will take on each value from the `results` list during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `result` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `result` is correctly initialized before the loop starts.
   - The state before the loop should include the initial value of `result` that will be used in the first iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:

- **`index`**: The value of `index` is given as `17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n`, but this is the final value after all iterations. For the loop to execute, we need to set `index` to the starting value, which is typically 0 or the initial position before the loop starts.
- **`t`**: The value of `t` is given as `t - 2`, but this is the final value after all iterations. For the loop to execute, we need to set `t` to its initial value, which is typically the number of iterations.
- **`results`**: This is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration. We don't need to adjust this list itself, but we need to ensure that it is properly initialized.
- **`PB`, `k`, `PS`, `p`, `a`**: These variables are derived from the `data` list and are updated based on their positions in the `data` list. We don't need to adjust these variables themselves, but we need to ensure that the `data` list is correctly initialized.

### Adjusted State:

Given the above analysis, the state before the loop should be:

- `index` is 0 (or the initial position before the loop starts).
- `t` is the number of iterations (which is the length of the `results` list).
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
- `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`.
- `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`.
- `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.

### Final Answer:

State: **`index` is 0, `t` is the length of `results`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.**
