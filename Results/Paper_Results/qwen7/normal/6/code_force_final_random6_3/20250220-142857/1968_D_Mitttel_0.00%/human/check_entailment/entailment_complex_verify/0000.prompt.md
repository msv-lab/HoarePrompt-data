You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

    Draw
    Draw
    Bodya
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Bodya
    
Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function does not account for Sasha's possible moves correctly. The function only considers Bodya's moves and does not properly simulate Sasha's moves, which can significantly affect the outcome of the game.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- **Bodya's starting position (PB):** 3
- **Sasha's starting position (PS):** 2
- **Length of the permutation (n):** 4
- **Duration of the game (k):** 2

The permutation is `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and the array `a` is `[7, 2, 5, 6]`.

Let's manually calculate the scores for both players:

**Bodya's moves:**
1. Start at position 3, score = 0 + a[3] = 0 + 6 = 6
2. Move to position 2, score = 6 + a[2] = 6 + 2 = 8

**Sasha's moves:**
1. Start at position 2, score = 0 + a[2] = 0 + 2 = 2
2. Move to position 1, score = 2 + a[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

Final scores:
- Bodya: 8
- Sasha: 9

According to the manual calculation, Sasha wins the game. However, the provided program incorrectly calculates the scores and does not handle Sasha's moves properly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
