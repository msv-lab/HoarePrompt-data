Output State: **`index` is 13 + 2 * n, `PB` is an integer from `data[6]`, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[9]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, data[index:index + n])`**

Explanation: The value of `index` was initially `13 + n + n`, which simplifies to `13 + 2 * n`. After executing `index += n`, the value of `index` is updated to `13 + 2 * n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
