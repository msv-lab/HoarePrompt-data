Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code updates the `score` by adding the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to the current `score`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
