Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `result in results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `index` is 0
   - `t` is the length of `results`
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration
   - `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`
   - `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`
   - `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `result`.
   - The other variables (`index`, `t`, `PB`, `k`, `PS`, `p`, `a`) remain unchanged within the loop.

5. **Next iteration state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the current iteration, `t` (the length of `results`) is decremented by 1 because one element has been processed.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`index` is 0, `t` is the length of `results` minus 1, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.**

However, since only the `t` value needs to be adjusted, the final state can be simplified to:

State: **`t` is the length of `results` minus 1**
