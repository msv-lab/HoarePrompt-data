Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in `func_1`. The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both players' starting positions but does not account for the fact that the players can move during their turns. The `calculate_score` function correctly calculates the score for a given starting position considering potential cycles in the permutation, but `func_1` should use the scores calculated by `calculate_score` for the actual moves made by each player over `k` turns.

To fix this, `func_1` needs to simulate the moves for each player over `k` turns using the `calculate_score` function. Hereâ€™s how you can modify `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    def calculate_score(start_pos):
        # ... (the existing implementation of calculate_score remains unchanged)
    
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'
```

This modification ensures that `func_1` correctly simulates the game for `k` turns and compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha. The rest of the code looks correct and should work as expected once this change is made.
