Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `results` is an empty list, `k` is `int(data[4])`.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `k` by converting `data[index + 1]` to an integer. Given that `index` is initially 3, `index + 1` equals 4, so `k` is assigned the integer value of `data[4]`. The values of `index`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.
