You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; PB and PS are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; p is a list of n integers representing the permutation; a is a list of n integers representing the array a.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n, `t` is `t - 2`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration, `PB` is an integer from `int(data[index + 2])`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `int(data[index + 3])`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers, and `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in `data` from `index` to `index + n` converted to integers.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `index` will have advanced by the total amount required for all iterations, which is 17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n. The variable `t` will have been decremented by the number of iterations minus one (since it starts at the number of iterations and decreases by one each time). The `results` list will contain the return values from `func_1` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `PB`, `k`, and `PS` will be updated based on their positions in the `data` list after the last iteration, and `p` and `a` will be lists of integers derived from the `data` list as described.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The index is 34, t is 0, results is a list containing the return values of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each iteration, PB is an integer from int(data[39]), k is int(data[38]), PS is an integer from int(data[40]), p is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in data from index 34 to 34 + n converted to integers, and a is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in data from index 34 to 34 + n converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n and k (positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), PB and PS (positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n), and p (a list of n integers representing the permutation) and a (a list of n integers representing the array a).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
