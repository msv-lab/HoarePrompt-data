### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure everything aligns with the problem requirements and the provided code.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic here is straightforward and correct if `calculate_score` works as expected.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for up to `k` turns.
   - It handles cycles within the permutation to optimize the calculation for long-term scores.
   - The function correctly accounts for the cycle detection and scoring within the cycle.
   - The logic for handling cycles and remaining steps is sound.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input data, extracts necessary parameters, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input format and prints the results.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring**:
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly identifies cycles in the permutation.
   - It calculates the score for the initial segment before entering the cycle.
   - It accurately calculates the score for the remaining steps using the cycle length and score.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_2` function reads input efficiently and processes it correctly.
   - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as when the permutation has no cycles or when `k` is very large.
   - The program correctly handles these cases by simulating the game for the required number of steps.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the implementation appears to be correct based on the problem description. The functions handle the logic for calculating scores and determining the winner appropriately.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
