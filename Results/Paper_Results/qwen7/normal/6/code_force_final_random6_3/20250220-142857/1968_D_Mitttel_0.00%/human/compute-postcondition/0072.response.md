Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps - 1`, `cycle_pos` remains unchanged, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `score` is `score + 2 * a[current_pos - 1] + a[current_pos - 1]`, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`, `steps` remains unchanged, `visited` dictionary remains unchanged, `remainder_steps` is decremented by 1, `current_pos` is updated to `p[current_pos - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `score += a[current_pos - 1]` adds the value of `a[current_pos - 1]` to `score`. Since `current_pos` was already updated to `p[current_pos - 1]` before this line, the new value of `score` is the previous value of `score` plus `2 * a[current_pos - 1]` (from the previous line) plus `a[current_pos - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
