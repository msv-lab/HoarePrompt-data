Output State: **`index` is 17 + 2 * n + n, `PB` is an integer from `data[index + 2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `k` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `PS` is an integer from `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]` using `map(int, ...)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from map(int, data[index:index + n]), `n` is `int(data[index])`.**

In natural language: The value of `index` is updated by adding `n` to its previous value, making it `17 + 2 * n + n`. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous values.
