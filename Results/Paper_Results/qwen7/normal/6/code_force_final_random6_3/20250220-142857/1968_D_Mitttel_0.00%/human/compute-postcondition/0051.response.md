Output State: **The index is 34, t is 0, results is a list containing the return values of func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a) for each iteration, PB is an integer from int(data[39]), k is int(data[38]), PS is an integer from int(data[40]), p is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in data from index 34 to 34 + n converted to integers, and a is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element in data from index 34 to 34 + n converted to integers.**

### Explanation:
- **Index Calculation**: The initial value of `index` is given as `17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n`. After 3 iterations, the index advances by `17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n` for each iteration, so the total advancement is `3 * (17 + 3 * n + 4 + 2 * n + n) = 3 * 34 = 102 / 3 = 34`.
- **Value of `t`**: The loop decrements `t` by 1 for each iteration. After 3 iterations, `t` becomes `3 - 3 = 0`.
- **Results List**: The `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration. Since the loop runs for 3 iterations, the `results` list will have 3 elements.
- **PB, k, PS**: These values are updated based on their positions in the `data` list after the last iteration. For the third iteration, `PB` is taken from `int(data[39])`, `k` is `int(data[38])`, and `PS` is `int(data[40])`.
- **Lists p and a**: These are derived from the `data` list starting from the new `index` position, which is 34. So, `p` and `a` are lists of integers obtained by converting each element in `data` from index 34 to 34 + n into integers.
