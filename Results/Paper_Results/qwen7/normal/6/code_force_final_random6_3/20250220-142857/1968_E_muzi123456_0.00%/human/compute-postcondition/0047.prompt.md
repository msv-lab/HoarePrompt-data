Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print('1', end=' ')
        print(i)
    print(' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 49, `n` is 49.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Given that the loop has executed up to the third iteration with `n` being at least 3, it implies that `n` could be any value from 3 to 49 (inclusive). However, since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, and we need to find the final state after all iterations, `n` must be 49 (the maximum possible value within the given range) for the loop to run its full course. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, which is 49.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `n`, since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `t` remains greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` as it was initially, and `n` retains its original input integer value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: The loop will print '1' followed by each integer from 1 to n exactly once.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution. The loop prints '1' followed by each integer from 1 to `n` on the same line, separated by spaces. Therefore, the final output will be a sequence of '1' followed by all integers from 1 to `n` printed consecutively without any new lines.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
