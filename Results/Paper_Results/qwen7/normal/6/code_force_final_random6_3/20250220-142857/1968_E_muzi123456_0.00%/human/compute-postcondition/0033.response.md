Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, making it `t - 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to the original value of `n`.
