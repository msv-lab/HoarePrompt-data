Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1` (This seems redundant and might be a typo. We'll assume it's just `t` is greater than 0).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` is still greater than 0.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

So, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2**
