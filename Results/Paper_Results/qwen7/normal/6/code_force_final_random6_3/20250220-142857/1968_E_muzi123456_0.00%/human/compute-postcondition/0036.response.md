To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet:

- The code snippet provided is: `print(i)`
- There is no explicit value or definition given for the variable `i` in the initial state.

Given this information, we need to consider what `i` might be. Since there is no explicit value or definition provided for `i`, we cannot determine its value from the given information alone. Therefore, the value of `i` could be any integer, but without more context, we cannot specify it precisely.

Output: **i**
