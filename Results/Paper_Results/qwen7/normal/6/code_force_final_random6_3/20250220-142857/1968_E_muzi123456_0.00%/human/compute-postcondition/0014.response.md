Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 49, `n` is 49.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Given that the loop has executed up to the third iteration with `n` being at least 3, it implies that `n` could be any value from 3 to 49 (inclusive). However, since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n`, and we need to find the final state after all iterations, `n` must be 49 (the maximum possible value within the given range) for the loop to run its full course. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, which is 49.
