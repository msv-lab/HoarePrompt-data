Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any other number, it would not satisfy both conditions simultaneously. For example, if `t` were 2, then `t - 1` would be 1, but `t` would not be equal to `t - 1`. Therefore, the only value that satisfies both conditions is `t = 1`.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

The print statement `print(i)` will print the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
