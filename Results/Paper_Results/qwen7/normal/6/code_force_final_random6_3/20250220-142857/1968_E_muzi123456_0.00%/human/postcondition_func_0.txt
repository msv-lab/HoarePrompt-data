The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints a line containing `n` occurrences of '1' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, each separated by a space. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` is set to 0.
