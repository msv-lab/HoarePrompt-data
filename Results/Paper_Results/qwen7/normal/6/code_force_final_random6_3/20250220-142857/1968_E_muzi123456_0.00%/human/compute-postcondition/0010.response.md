Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, the loop will run for `i = 1, 2, ..., n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 3 if the loop continues.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
