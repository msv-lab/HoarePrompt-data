Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 2, `s` is 3 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)**

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 2, `k` as the third integer input greater than 2, and `s` as `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`. The code snippet updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is 2, the updated expression for `s` becomes `3 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
