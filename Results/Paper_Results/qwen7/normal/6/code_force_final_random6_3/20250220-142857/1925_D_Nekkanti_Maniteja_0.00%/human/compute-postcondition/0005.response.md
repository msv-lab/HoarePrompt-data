Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `a`. Since `a` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
