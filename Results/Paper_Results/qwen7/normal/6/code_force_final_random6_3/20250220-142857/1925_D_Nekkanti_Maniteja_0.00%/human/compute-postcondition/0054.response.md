Output State: **`s` is `c * (k + m - 1) * c * m * m + c * a * m`, `i` is `k + m`, `c` is `(n * (n - 1) // 1) ** -1 % 10`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 10.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated to the value of `(n * (n - 1) // 1) ** -1 % 10`. All other variables (`s`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
