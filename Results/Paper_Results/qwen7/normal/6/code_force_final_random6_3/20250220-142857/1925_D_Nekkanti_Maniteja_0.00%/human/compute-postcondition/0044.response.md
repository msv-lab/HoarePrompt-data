Output State: **`s` is `s + c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `k` is an integer, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the expression `c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + c * a` to its current value. The values of `k` and `m` remain unchanged, and `k` is still an integer while `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
