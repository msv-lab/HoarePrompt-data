Output State: **`i` is `k`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is `k * (c * k * c * m + c * a)`**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The initial value of `i` is `k`, which remains unchanged. The value of `s` is calculated using the formula `k * (c * k * c * m + c * a)`, but since the values of `c` and `a` are not provided, they remain as they are in the expression. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with the unchanged value of `i` and the unchanged expression for `s`.
