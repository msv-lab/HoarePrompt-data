Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot provide a numerical value for `c`. However, we know that `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of the expression `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` under modulo `M`. All other variables retain their initial states.
