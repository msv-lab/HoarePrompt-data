Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007.**

The code initializes the variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is 1000000007. This value does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
