Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for modulo operations.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This is intended to be used later for some calculations.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - `a` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the sum of friendship values from all the pairs of friends.
   - A loop runs `m` times to read each pair of friends and add their friendship value to `a`.

4. **Main Calculation:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0 and will store the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - A loop runs `k` times to simulate the excursions.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`. However, this formula seems incorrect for the problem's requirements.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `c` as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is unnecessary and incorrect. The problem does not require any modular inverse calculations for the solution.

2. **Formula for Expected Value:**
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` inside the loop is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. Specifically, the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be the sum of the friendship values divided by the number of possible pairs, adjusted for the fact that the friendship value increases over time.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. The expected value for each excursion is the sum of friendship values divided by the number of possible pairs, adjusted for the fact that the friendship value increases over time.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        s = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            s += f
        expected_value = (s * k * (k + 1) // 2) % M
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the use of unnecessary modular inverse calculations and an incorrect formula for the expected value. The corrected program above should be used instead.

**Correctness: False**
