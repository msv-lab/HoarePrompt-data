Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by `m` pairs of friends with their respective friendship values `f_i`.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program calculates the modular inverse `c` of `n * (n - 1)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary for the calculation of the expected value.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The program correctly accumulates the sum `a` of all friendship values `f_i` provided in the input.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The formula used in the program to calculate `s` is incorrect. The expected value should be calculated using the probability of choosing a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship value over `k` excursions. Specifically, the expected value for each excursion is the sum of the probabilities of choosing each friend pair multiplied by the increase in friendship value for those pairs.

5. **Final Output**: The program correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and prints the output for each test case.

Given these points, the program incorrectly implements the expected value calculation. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair of friends and summing these values. The current implementation does not accurately reflect this.

Correctness: **False**
