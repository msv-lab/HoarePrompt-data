Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `k + m - 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split operation for each iteration, `a` is the sum of all `f` values entered during the loop iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `k + m - 1`, indicating it has gone through all `m` iterations starting from `k`. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input over these iterations. The values of `u` and `v` will reflect the most recent inputs from the last iteration of the loop, but since they are not used outside the loop, their specific values are not fixed and depend on the inputs provided during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is `s + c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + c * a`, `k` is an integer, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is `s + c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `k` is an integer, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is `2 * c * (k + m - 1) * c * m + 2 * c * a + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is `i + 1`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
