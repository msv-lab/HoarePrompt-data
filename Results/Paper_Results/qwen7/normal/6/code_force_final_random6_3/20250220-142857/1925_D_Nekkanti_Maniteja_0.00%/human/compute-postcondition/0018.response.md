Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `s` by adding the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, the term `c * i * c * m` becomes 0, simplifying the expression to just `c * a`. Therefore, `s` is updated to be `c * a`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
