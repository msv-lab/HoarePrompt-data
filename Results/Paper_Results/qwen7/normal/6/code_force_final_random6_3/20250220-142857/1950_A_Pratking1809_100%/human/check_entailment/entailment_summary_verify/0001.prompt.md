You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9, and an integer \(t\) within the range 1 to 1000. For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

Given that the conditions for 'STAIR' and 'PEAK' are correctly implemented and the logic follows the problem statement precisely, the program should work as intended.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description.
