Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `q` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is the first integer entered.
- `b` is the second integer entered.
- `c` is the third integer entered.
- The condition `a < b > c` is false, meaning that `b` is not both greater than `a` and `c`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **'PEAK'**
