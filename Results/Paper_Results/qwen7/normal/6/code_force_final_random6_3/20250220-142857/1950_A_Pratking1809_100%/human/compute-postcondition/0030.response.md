Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input, where `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is the third integer from the input.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('NONE')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NONE'`. Since no variables or objects are being referenced within the `print` statement, only the string itself is printed.

Output: **NONE**
