### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of the peak condition check. The condition `a < b > c` should be `a < b and b > c` to ensure both conditions are satisfied simultaneously. In the current implementation, the condition `a < b > c` is evaluated as a single boolean expression, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the test case `3 4 1`. The current implementation would evaluate `3 < 4 > 1` as `True` because `4 > 1` is true, even though `3 < 4` is also true. This leads to printing 'PEAK' when it should print 'STAIR'.

To fix this, the condition should be split into two separate comparisons:

```python
if a < b and b > c:
    print('PEAK')
```

This ensures that both conditions `a < b` and `b > c` are met simultaneously.

Given the logical error in the peak condition check, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
