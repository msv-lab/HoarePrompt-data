Output State: **`t` is a positive integer reduced by 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a set of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n, `f` is 1, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split by the lambda function `R()`, `b` is a set of integers generated by `R()`, `m` is assigned the value `k // 2`, and `n` is assigned the value `k // 2**.

This means that the variables `m` and `n` have been updated to be equal to `k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
