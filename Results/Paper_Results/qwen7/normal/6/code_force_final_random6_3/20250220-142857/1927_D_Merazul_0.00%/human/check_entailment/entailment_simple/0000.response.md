Reasoning:
The provided code snippet does not correctly solve the given problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The code attempts to handle multiple test cases and queries but does not properly parse the input for each test case. Specifically, it does not correctly read the array `a` and the queries for each test case.

2. **Logic Mismatch**: The logic inside the loop does not match the problem requirements. The code is trying to check if every integer `i` from 1 to `k` is present in either set `a` or set `b`, which is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires finding a pair of different elements within a specified subarray for each query.

3. **Output Format**: Even if the logic were correct, the output format would still be incorrect. The code prints 'YNEOS' based on some conditions, which does not provide the required indices `i` and `j`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
