Output State: **`f` is 1, `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `t` is 0, `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()` except for the second element, `b` is a set containing all elements of the tuple returned by `R()`, `m` is `k // 2`, `n` is `k // 2**.

This means that `m` and `n` are both assigned the value of `k // 2`, which is the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
