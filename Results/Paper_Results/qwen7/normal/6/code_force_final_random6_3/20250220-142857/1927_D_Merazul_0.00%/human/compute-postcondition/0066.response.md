Output State: **`u` is a boolean value indicating whether `i` is in list `a`, `i` is a variable with its original value, `b` is a list with its original values, and `v` is a boolean value indicating whether `i` is in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `v = i in b` checks if the variable `i` is present in the list `b` and assigns the result (a boolean value) to `v`. The initial values of `u`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged.
