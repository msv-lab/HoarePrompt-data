### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires identifying pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) where \(a_i \neq a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \(-1 -1\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` is defined but does not match the problem requirements.
   - The code uses some lambda functions and unpacking operations that are not relevant to solving the problem.
   - It reads input and processes it in a way that does not align with the problem statement.
   - Variables like `a` and `b` are sets of integers, but the logic to find the required indices is missing.
   - The condition checking and printing part seems unrelated to the problem's requirements.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary describes a process of checking if every integer from 1 to \(k\) is present in at least one of two sets, \(a\) and \(b\).
   - This does not match the problem's requirement of finding pairs of indices within a specific range where the elements are different.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - We should identify if there are at least two distinct elements in this subarray.
   - If there are, we need to find and print one such pair of indices.
   - If not, we should print \(-1 -1\).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The provided code does not implement the expected solution. It does not handle the subarrays correctly and does not find pairs of indices where the elements are different.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
