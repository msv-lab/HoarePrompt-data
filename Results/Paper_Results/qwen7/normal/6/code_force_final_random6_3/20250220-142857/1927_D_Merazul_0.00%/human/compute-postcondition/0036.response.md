Output State: **`t` is True-1, `f` is 1, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is at least 3, `u` is always False, `v` is always False, `m` is -3, `n` is -3, `b` is a set containing the elements returned by `R()`, `_` is the second element of `R()`'s return, `k` is the first element of `R()`'s return.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `m` and `n` to be equal to `k // 2`. Since `k` is at least 3, `k // 2` is equivalent to `-3` (integer division of a negative number). Therefore, both `m` and `n` are updated to `-3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
