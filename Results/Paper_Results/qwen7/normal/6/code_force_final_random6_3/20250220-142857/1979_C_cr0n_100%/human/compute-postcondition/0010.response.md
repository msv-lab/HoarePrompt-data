Output State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `x` is the next element in the list `vals`; `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)` and then reassigned to the result of `func_1(den, x)` again.**

This means that the value of `den` has been updated to the result of the function call `func_1(den, x)`, while the values of `vals` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
