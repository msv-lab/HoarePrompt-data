### Reasoning

The original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the total bet equals the winnings, which should result in `-1`. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The program should output `-1` if no such distribution is possible.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Reading**: Reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - **LCM Calculation**: Initializes `den` with the first multiplier and iteratively calculates the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
   - **Bet Distribution**: Computes the required bet amounts for each outcome by dividing `den` by each multiplier. It then subtracts the sum of these bet amounts from `den` to get the remaining value.
   - **Output**: If the remaining value is non-positive, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

#### Correctness Analysis
1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the bet amounts are distributed in a way that minimizes the total bet while ensuring the condition is met.
2. **Bet Distribution**: The bet amounts are correctly calculated as `den // r` for each multiplier \( r \). These amounts ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where the total bet is not strictly less than the winnings by checking if the remaining value after distributing the bets is non-positive.

However, the original assessment points out that the program should handle cases where the total bet equals the winnings, which should result in `-1`. Let's consider this edge case more closely.

#### Edge Case Handling
- **Case where total bet equals the winnings**: If the LCM of all multipliers is exactly equal to the sum of the bet amounts, the remaining value after distributing the bets will be zero, leading to `-1` being printed. This is handled correctly by the program since it checks if `den` is non-positive and prints `-1` accordingly.

Given that the program correctly handles the edge case where the total bet equals the winnings, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the annotated code. It correctly handles all cases, including the edge case where the total bet equals the winnings.
