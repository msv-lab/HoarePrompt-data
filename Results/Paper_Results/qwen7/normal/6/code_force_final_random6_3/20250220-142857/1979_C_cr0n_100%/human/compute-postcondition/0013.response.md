Output State: **`vals` is an empty list; `den` is the final result obtained by successively applying the `func_1(den, x)` function to each element `x` in the original list `vals`.**

Explanation: The code `vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]` creates a new list `vprod` by iterating over the list `vals` and applying the floor division operation `//` between `den` and each element `r` in `vals`. However, since `vals` is already an empty list, there are no elements to iterate over, and thus the list `vprod` will also be empty. The value of `den` remains unchanged because no elements from `vals` are processed. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `vals` being an empty list and `den` holding the cumulative result of applying `func_1` to the original elements of `vals`.
