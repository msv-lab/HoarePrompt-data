Output State: `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `den` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to the initial value of `den` and each element in `vals` sequentially.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `den` will be the final result of successively applying the function `func_1` to the initial value of `den` and every element in the list `vals`.
