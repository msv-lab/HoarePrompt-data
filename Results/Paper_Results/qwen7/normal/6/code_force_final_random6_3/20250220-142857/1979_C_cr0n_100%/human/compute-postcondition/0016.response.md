Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `vals` is an empty list.
   - `den` is defined as `den - sum(vprod)`. Since `vprod` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value directly. However, it's mentioned that the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

Given that the only `print` statement outputs `-1`, and there is no dependency on the value of `den` in this specific line, the value `-1` will be printed regardless of the value of `den`.

Output: **-1**
