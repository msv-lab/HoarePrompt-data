Output State: **`vals` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `x` is the next element in the list `vals`; `den` is the result of calling `func_1(den, x)`**

Explanation: The code `den = func_1(den, x)` updates the value of `den` by calling the function `func_1` with `den` and `x` as arguments. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `den` after the function call. However, we know that `den` is now the result of the function call, and the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
