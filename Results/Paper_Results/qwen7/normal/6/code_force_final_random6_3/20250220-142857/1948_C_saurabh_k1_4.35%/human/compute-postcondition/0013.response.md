Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, and the value of `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(str, input()))` takes an input from the user, converts each character of the input into a string, and stores these strings in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new list `a` contains the characters from the input as strings.
