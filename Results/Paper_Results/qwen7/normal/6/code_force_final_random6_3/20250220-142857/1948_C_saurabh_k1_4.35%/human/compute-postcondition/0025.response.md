Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer reduced to 0 after all iterations, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the last input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the last input.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `n` is reduced to 0 since it is decremented by the nature of the loop but never actually used in the loop body to modify its value. The lists `a` and `b` contain the final inputs provided by the last test case, as each test case overwrites these lists.
