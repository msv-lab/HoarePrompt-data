Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, and `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is updated to be a list of strings converted from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(str, input()))` reads a line of input and converts each character in the input into a string, storing these strings in the list `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and the condition of `b[n - 2]`) remain unchanged.
