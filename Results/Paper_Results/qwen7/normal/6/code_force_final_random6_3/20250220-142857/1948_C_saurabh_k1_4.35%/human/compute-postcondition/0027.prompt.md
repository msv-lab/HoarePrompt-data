You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes the width n of the grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even), followed by two strings of length n, where each string consists only of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer reduced to 0 after all iterations, `b` is a list of strings obtained from the last input, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the last input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even) representing the width of the grid, followed by two strings of length n consisting only of '<' and '>' characters representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively. The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether it's possible to start from any cell in the first row and move through the grid following the arrows to reach any cell in the second row without violating the movement rules.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
