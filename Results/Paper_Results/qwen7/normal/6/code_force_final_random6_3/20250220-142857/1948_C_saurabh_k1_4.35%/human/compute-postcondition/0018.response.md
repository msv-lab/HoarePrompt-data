Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
   - `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`.
   - `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
   - `b` is updated to be a list of strings converted from the input.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - The loop will execute once for each integer read from the input.
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` determines how many times the loop will run.
   - After the first iteration, the value of `int(input())` will be reduced by 1 because one iteration has already occurred.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` which controls the loop execution.
   - After the first iteration, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that one iteration has occurred, and the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the input integer, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b[n - 2]` is either `'<'` or not `'<'`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `b` is updated to be a list of strings converted from the input, `int(input())` is reduced by 1**.
