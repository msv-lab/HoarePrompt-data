Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is now the health of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the next monster, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(pos)` for the next monster.**

This means that the `distance` variable is recalculated as the absolute value of the position (`abs(pos)`) for the next monster in the `monsters` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
