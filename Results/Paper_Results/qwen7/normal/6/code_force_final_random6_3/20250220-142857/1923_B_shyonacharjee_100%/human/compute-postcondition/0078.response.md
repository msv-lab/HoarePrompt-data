Output State: **`monsters` must contain at least one tuple; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

In this case, the code calculates the absolute value of `pos` and assigns it to the variable `distance`. Since `pos` is not defined in the initial state, `distance` is expressed as the absolute value of `pos`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
