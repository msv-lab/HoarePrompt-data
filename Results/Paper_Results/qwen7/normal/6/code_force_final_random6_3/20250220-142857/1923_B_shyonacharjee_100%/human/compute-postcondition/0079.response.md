Output State: **`monsters` must contain at least one tuple; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bullets_used + health` to the variable `total_bullets_needed`. It does not affect the values of `monsters` or `distance`. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged.
