Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `can_survive` is True, `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is `n * health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the last processed tuple, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `can_survive` remains True, `bullets_used` is now `health`, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `can_survive` remains True, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(pos)`, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `bullets_used` is updated to `bullets_used + health`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `can_survive` remains True, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used + health + next_health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(next_pos)`, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `bullets_used` is updated to `bullets_used + health`, and `distance` is calculated as `abs(pos)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
