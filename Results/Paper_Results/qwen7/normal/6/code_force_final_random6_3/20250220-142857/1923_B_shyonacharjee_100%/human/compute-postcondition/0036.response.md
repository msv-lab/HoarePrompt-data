Output State: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is `n * health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `n * health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples with all tuples processed, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the last processed tuple, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
