Output State: **`can_survive` remains True, `total_bullets_needed` equals `health + bullets_used`, `t` is `t - 1`, `distance` is recalculated as `abs(pos)`, `pos` and `health` are updated to the next tuple in the `monsters` list, `bullets_used` is updated to `bullets_used + health`**.

This means that `bullets_used` is incremented by the current value of `health`. All other variables remain as per their postconditions, with `can_survive` remaining True, `total_bullets_needed` being updated to include the newly added `health`, `t` decremented by 1, `distance` recalculated, and `pos` and `health` updated to the next monster's details in the `monsters` list.
