Output State: **`bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, the first element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `pos`, the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and the total bullets needed (`total_bullets_needed`) is greater than the distance times `k`.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `can_survive`, which changes its value from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
