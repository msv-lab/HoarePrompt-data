Output State: **`can_survive` remains False, `bullets_used` is `n * health`, `total_bullets_needed` is `n * health`, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple, `distance` is `abs(pos)` for the last processed tuple, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code sorts the `monsters` list based on the absolute value of the first element in each tuple. The sorting does not affect the values of other variables like `can_survive`, `bullets_used`, `total_bullets_needed`, `t`, `x`, `distance`, and `a`.
