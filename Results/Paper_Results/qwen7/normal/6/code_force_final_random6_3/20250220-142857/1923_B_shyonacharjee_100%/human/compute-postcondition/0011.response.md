Postcondition: **`bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, the first element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `pos`, the second element of the first tuple in `monsters` is `health`, `can_survive` is True, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and the total bullets needed (`total_bullets_needed`) is greater than the distance times `k`.**
