Output State: **`cw` is either `not nw` or `True`; `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `N` is an input integer; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is 1; `nw` is equal to `cw`.**

Explanation: The line `nw = cw` assigns the current value of `cw` to `nw`. This does not change the values of any other variables. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.
