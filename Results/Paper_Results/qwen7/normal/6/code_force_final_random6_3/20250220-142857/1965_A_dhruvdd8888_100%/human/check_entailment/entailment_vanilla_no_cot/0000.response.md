Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of piles `N` and the list of stone counts for each pile but does not process this information correctly. Specifically, the line `nums = set(input().split())` is incorrect because it splits the input string into individual characters and then converts them to a set, which is not what is needed here. Instead, the input should be split into integers directly.

2. **Logic Errors in `func_1`**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The current implementation attempts to use a set and sorting, which is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.
   - The logic for checking the winner (`nw` and `cw`) is overly complex and does not correctly implement the game rules.

3. **Unnecessary Functions and Variables**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop. The variable `rrr` is also unused and should be removed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum non-zero pile
    min_non_zero = min(filter(lambda x: x > 0, nums))
    
    # Calculate the XOR of all pile sizes reduced by the minimum non-zero pile size
    xor_result = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 0:
            xor_result ^= (num - min_non_zero)
    
    if xor_result > 0:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of piles `N` and the list of stone counts for each pile.
- **Finding Minimum Non-Zero Pile**: It finds the minimum non-zero pile size, which is used to reduce all pile sizes.
- **XOR Calculation**: It calculates the XOR of all pile sizes after reducing them by the minimum non-zero pile size.
- **Determine Winner**: If the XOR result is greater than 0, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

This approach leverages the fact that the game is equivalent to the Nim game, where the winning strategy is determined by the XOR of the pile sizes.
