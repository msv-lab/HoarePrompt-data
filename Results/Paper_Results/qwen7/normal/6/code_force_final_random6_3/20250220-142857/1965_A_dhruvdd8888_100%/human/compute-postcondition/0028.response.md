Output State: **`cw` is True, `nw` is equal to `cw`, `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `cw`. This changes the value of `cw` but does not affect any other variables. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
