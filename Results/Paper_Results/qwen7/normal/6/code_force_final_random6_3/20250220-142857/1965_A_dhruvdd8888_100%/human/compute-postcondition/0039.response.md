Output: **Alice**

Explanation: 
- The initial state indicates that `cw` is either `not nw` or `True`. Given that the if condition `(cw)` is true, it means `cw` is `True`.
- `nw` is equal to `cw`, so `nw` is also `True`.
- Since the if condition `(cw)` is true, the code inside the if block will execute, which is the `print('Alice')` statement.
- Therefore, the output will be the string "Alice".
