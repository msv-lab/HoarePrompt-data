Output State: `cw` is either `not nw` or `True`; `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `N` is an input integer; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is 0; `nw` is equal to `cw`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `len(nums) - 2` down to 1. After the loop completes, the variable `i` will be decremented to 0. The value of `nw` will be updated based on the value of `cw` at each iteration. Since the loop ends when `i` reaches 0, the final state of `nw` will be equal to the final state of `cw`. The value of `cw` depends on whether `nums[i]` equals 1 during any iteration. If it does, `cw` becomes `not nw`; otherwise, it remains `True`. Therefore, `nw` will be `cw` after all iterations.
