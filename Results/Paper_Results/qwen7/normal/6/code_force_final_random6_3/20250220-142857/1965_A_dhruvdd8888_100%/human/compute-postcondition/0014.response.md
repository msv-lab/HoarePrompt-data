Output State: **`ls` is `nums[3]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `ls += nums[i]` increments `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`, which is `nums[3]` since `i` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
