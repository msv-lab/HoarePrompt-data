Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it first sorts the list and adjusts the values to compute the cumulative sum `ls`. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to determine whether `cw` is `not nw` or `True`. Based on the final value of `cw`, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
