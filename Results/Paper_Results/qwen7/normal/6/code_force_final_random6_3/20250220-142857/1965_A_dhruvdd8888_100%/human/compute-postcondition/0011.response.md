Output State: **`ls` is `nums[0] + nums[i]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers (converted from the original set `nums`), `i` is 2, and `nums[i]` is decreased by `nums[0]`**

Explanation: The line `ls += nums[i]` increments `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `ls` is updated to `nums[0] + nums[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
