Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(nums) - 2` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts from `len(nums) - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nw` is equal to `cw`
   - `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `N` is an input integer
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
   - `nums` is a sorted list of integers
   - `i` is 1

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, and the loop starts from `len(nums) - 2` and goes down to `1`, the next value of `i` should be `0`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `nw` remains unchanged
   - `ls` remains unchanged
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - `N` remains unchanged
   - `n` remains unchanged
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged
   - `nums` remains unchanged
   - `i` changes to `0`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nw` is equal to `cw`, `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 0**
