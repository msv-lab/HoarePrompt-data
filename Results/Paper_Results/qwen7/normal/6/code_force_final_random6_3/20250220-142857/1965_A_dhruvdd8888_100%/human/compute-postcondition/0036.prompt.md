Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nw` is set to True, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `cw` is set to True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
    if nums[i] == 1:
        cw = not nw
    else:
        cw = True
    nw = cw


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nw` is equal to `cw`; `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `N` is an input integer; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is at least 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nw` is equal to `cw`, `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cw` is either `not nw` or `True`; `ls` remains the sum of all elements in the list `nums`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `N` is an input integer; `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `nums` is a sorted list of integers; `i` is 1; `nw` is equal to `cw`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
