Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `q` must be 0, `ac` is either 1 or 2, `bc` is either 1 or 2, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the third character in the string `s`. If the third character `i` in the string `s` is 'A', then `ac` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ac` remains 1 while `bc` is set to 2.
