### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in a given string of length 5, where each character is either 'A' or 'B'. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

3. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. It then iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').

4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the two counts. If `ac` (the count of 'A') is greater than `bc` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all possible combinations of 'A' and 'B' in the string correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5, the logic will always work as intended.

6. **Output Format**: The program outputs the result for each test case on a new line, which matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
