Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` must be 0, `ac` is 1, `bc` is either 1 or 0, `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the second character in the string `s`**.

Explanation: The variable `ac` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state (either 0 or 1) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
