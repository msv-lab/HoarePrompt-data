Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in the string `s` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is already set to the last character in the string `s` before the loop starts.
   - The variable `s` is the new input string, and for the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string (since an empty string would result in no iterations).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is already set to the last character in the string `s`, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string so that the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `s` must be a non-empty string.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`ac` is 0, `q` is 1, `bc` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty string, `i` is the last character in the string `s`**.
