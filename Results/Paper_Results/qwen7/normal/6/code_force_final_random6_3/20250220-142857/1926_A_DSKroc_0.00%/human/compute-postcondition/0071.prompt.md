Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 32
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `q` must be 0, `ac` is equal to the total number of 'A' characters in the string `s`, `bc` is equal to the total number of non-'A' characters in the string `s`, `s` is the original input string, and `i` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ac` is an integer, `q` is 1, `bc` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, and `i` does not exist.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `ac` is between 0 and the length of the string `s`, `q` is 2, `bc` is between 0 and the length of the string `s`, `s` is an input string that has been fully processed.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ac` will be equal to the number of times the character 'A' appears in the string `s`. The variable `q` remains unchanged at 2, and `bc` will be equal to the number of times any character other than 'A' appears in the string `s`. Both `ac` and `bc` together account for the total length of the string `s`, with `ac` representing the count of 'A's and `bc` representing the count of non-'A' characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
