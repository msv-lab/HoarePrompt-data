Output State: **`ac` is either 1 or 2, `q` is 2, `bc` is 1, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character remaining**

Explanation: The value of `bc` is incremented by 1. Since `bc` was either 0 or 1 initially, adding 1 to it results in `bc` becoming 1. The other variables (`ac`, `q`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
