Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed. According to the problem, a rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into a different rectangle if the original dimensions allow such a transformation. 

For example, consider the case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\). The original rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return "no" for this case because `b % 2 == 0` is true, but it does not account for the possibility of cutting along the length to form a new rectangle.

To fix this, the function should check if either dimension can be evenly divided into smaller rectangles that can be recombined into a different rectangle. A more appropriate approach would be to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is greater than 1 and if the other dimension is even, or if both dimensions are greater than 1. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if a > 1 and b % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    if b > 1 and a % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'
```

This corrected function properly handles the cases where a rectangle can be cut and reformed into a different rectangle.
