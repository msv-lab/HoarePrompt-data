Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` checks if `b` is even, but this is not sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. According to the problem, a rectangle can always be divided into smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can often be rearranged to form a new rectangle, unless the original rectangle is a square (i.e., `a == b`).

To fix this, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is equal to 1 (which means the rectangle cannot be divided further without forming 1x1 squares) or if both `a` and `b` are equal (which means the only way to divide it would result in 1x1 squares, thus not forming a new rectangle).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'Yes' if a != 1 and b != 1 and a != b else 'No'
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected based on the problem statement.
