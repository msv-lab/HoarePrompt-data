Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from a given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them. The key observation here is that for Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the resulting rectangles after the cut must have dimensions that allow forming a new rectangle.

Let's analyze the given solution:

1. The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if `b` is an even number.
2. If `b` is even, the function returns 'yes'.
3. If `b` is odd, the function returns 'no'.

This logic is flawed for the following reasons:
- Cutting a rectangle along its width (`a` dimension) or height (`b` dimension) and rearranging the pieces can form a new rectangle if either `a` or `b` is even. However, the current implementation only checks if `b` is even.
- For instance, consider a \(2 \times 4\) rectangle. Cutting it along the width results in two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle. Here, neither `a` nor `b` is even, but the function would incorrectly return 'no'.
- Similarly, a \(3 \times 5\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 2.5\) rectangles (which isn't possible since we need integer dimensions), but if we consider a \(3 \times 6\) rectangle, cutting it along the width results in two \(3 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(6 \times 3\) rectangle. Here, `b` is even, but the function correctly returns 'yes'.

To fix this, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`.

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, missing cases where `a` could be even and still allow forming a new rectangle.
