Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is defined to check if Bob can form another rectangle.
   - The logic in `func_1` checks if `b % 2 == 0`. If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`, otherwise `'no'`.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - According to the problem, Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - The key insight here is that if `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. For example:
     - A \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
     - A \(2 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.
   - If `b` is odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle because cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles will result in at least one dimension being odd, and no further rearrangement will yield a different rectangle.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the logic to check if `b` is even.
   - However, the function should return `'Yes'` if `b % 2 == 0` and `'No'` otherwise, not `'yes'` and `'no'` as written. The output should match the required format.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` should return `'Yes'` or `'No'` instead of `'yes'` or `'no'`. Therefore, the program is almost correct but needs a minor adjustment in the return values.

### Corrected Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'Yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'No'
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but needs to return `'Yes'` and `'No'` instead of `'yes'` and `'no'`.
