Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `T` and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines and prints whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins based on specific conditions involving `a` and `b`. The final state of the program includes printed outcomes for all test cases, with `T` remaining unchanged and `i` being updated to `T - 1` after processing all cases.**
