Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `b` is the second integer input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'` to the console. The values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` do not affect this particular print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **Alice**
