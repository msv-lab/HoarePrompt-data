Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, and `b` is not equal to 1, and `a` is even, and if `b` is odd, then the conditions remain the same as the precondition. If `b` is not odd (i.e., `b` is even or `a` is greater than `b` or `a` is less than or equal to `b`), then these conditions also hold.
