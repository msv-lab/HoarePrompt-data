Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer. Regardless of whether `a` is even and `b` is odd or not, the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
