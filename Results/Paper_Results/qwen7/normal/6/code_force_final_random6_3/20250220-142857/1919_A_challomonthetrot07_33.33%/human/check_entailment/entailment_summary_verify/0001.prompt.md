You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `T` and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it determines and prints whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins based on specific conditions involving `a` and `b`. The final state of the program includes printed outcomes for all test cases, with `T` remaining unchanged and `i` being updated to `T - 1` after processing all cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Analysis**:
   - For each test case, the program takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - The program then checks various conditions to determine the winner based on the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Conditions Checked**:
   - **Case 1**: `a == b` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 2**: `a == 1` → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 3**: `b == 1` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 4**: `a % 2 == 1` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Case 5**: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` → Print 'Alice'
   - **Case 6**: `a > b` → Print 'Bob'
   - **Default Case**: Print 'Alice'

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy for this game involves understanding that the player who faces a situation where their wallet has an odd number of coins can force the opponent into a losing position.
   - Specifically, if a player has an odd number of coins, they can always force the opponent into a situation where they have an even number of coins, eventually leading to a win.
   - Conversely, if a player has an even number of coins, they are at risk of being forced into a situation where they have an odd number of coins, potentially leading to a loss.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement align with the logic implemented in the function.
   - For instance, when `a == 1`, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a situation where he has 0 coins.
   - When `a % 2 == 1`, Bob will always win because he can force Alice into a situation where she has 0 coins.
   - The other conditions also correctly reflect the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy for the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
