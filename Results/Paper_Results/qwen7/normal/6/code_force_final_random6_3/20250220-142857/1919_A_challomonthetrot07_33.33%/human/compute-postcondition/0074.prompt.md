Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(T):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print('Bob')
    elif a == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif b == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif a > b:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` equals `b`. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `a` remains within certain constraints: if `a` equals 1, `T` and `i` remain unchanged, and `a` equals 1. If `a` does not equal 1, `a` remains not equal to 1, `b` remains 1 if it equals 1, and if `a` is odd, it remains unchanged. If `a` is even, it is either changed to a value greater than `b` or to an odd number, or it remains less than or equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input. Regardless of whether `a` equals `b`, the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer. The values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged regardless of whether `a` equals `b` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
