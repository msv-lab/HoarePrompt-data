Based on the initial state provided:

- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
- `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Since no specific values for `a` and `b` are needed to determine the output of the `print` statement, and the statement itself does not depend on `a` or `b`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Alice**
