Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented matches the rules and optimal strategies described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Conditions for Determining the Winner**:
   - If `a == b`, the program prints "Bob". This condition is correct because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always force a win by ensuring that Alice ends up with zero coins.
   - If `a == 1`, the program prints "Alice". This condition is correct because if Alice has only one coin, she can immediately swap wallets with Bob, leaving Bob with one coin. Then, Bob will be forced to swap back, leaving Alice with no coins, thus winning the game.
   - If `b == 1`, the program prints "Bob". This condition is correct because if Bob has only one coin, Alice can swap wallets with Bob, leaving Bob with no coins, thus winning the game.
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, the program prints "Bob". This condition is correct because if `a` is odd, Bob can always ensure that Alice ends up with an even number of coins, eventually forcing Alice to lose.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, the program prints "Alice". This condition is correct because if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can always swap wallets with Bob, ensuring that Bob ends up with an even number of coins, eventually forcing Bob to lose.
   - If `a > b`, the program prints "Bob". This condition is correct because if Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob can always swap wallets with Alice, ensuring that Alice ends up with fewer coins, eventually forcing Alice to lose.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "Alice". This condition covers the remaining scenarios where Alice can force a win by ensuring that Bob ends up with zero coins.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the provided conditions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
