Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal strategy. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Equal Coins (a == b):**
   - The solution correctly prints "Bob" when `a == b`. This part is correct because if both players have the same number of coins, Bob can always force a win by swapping wallets until Alice is left with no coins.

2. **Single Coin (a == 1 or b == 1):**
   - The solution handles the case where one player has exactly 1 coin correctly. If Alice has 1 coin, she can't make a move after removing it, so Bob wins. Similarly, if Bob has 1 coin, Alice can swap and then remove her coin, leaving Bob with no valid moves.

3. **Odd Number of Coins (a % 2 == 1):**
   - The solution correctly identifies that if Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob can always win by forcing Alice into a position where she has an even number of coins and eventually runs out of moves.

4. **Even Number of Coins (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1):**
   - The solution incorrectly assumes that if Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number, Alice can win. However, this is not always true. For example, if Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 1, Bob can swap and then remove his coin, leaving Alice with no valid moves.

5. **General Case (a > b):**
   - The solution incorrectly prints "Bob" when `a > b`. This is not always true. For example, if Alice has 4 coins and Bob has 3, Alice can swap and then remove her coin, leaving Bob with 2 coins. Bob will then be forced to swap and remove his coin, leaving Alice with 3 coins again, and the cycle continues until Bob runs out of moves.

6. **Other Cases:**
   - The general logic for other cases needs to be more nuanced. The key is to understand that the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of coins plays a crucial role in determining the winner.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the number of coins:
- If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This solution correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
