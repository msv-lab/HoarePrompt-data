Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the string contains overlapping substrings "pie" or "map". For example, in the input "ppiee", the program would only remove one 'e' to make the string "ppie", which still contains the substring "pie". However, the correct solution should remove both 'e's to make the string "pp", which is beautiful. Therefore, the program does not remove the minimum number of characters in such cases.
