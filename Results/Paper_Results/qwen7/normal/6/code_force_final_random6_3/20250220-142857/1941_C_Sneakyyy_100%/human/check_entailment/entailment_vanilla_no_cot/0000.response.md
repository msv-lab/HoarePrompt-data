Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `while` loop only checks for substrings of length 3 ("map" or "pie") and increments the counter `ans` by 1 for each occurrence found. However, this approach fails to account for overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" within the string.

For example, consider the string "mapmapmap". The current implementation would incorrectly count the number of deletions needed as 3 (one for each "map"), but the correct answer should be 2, as deleting the middle "map" would make the entire string beautiful.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we skip over the matched substrings properly and handle overlapping cases. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if a[i:i+3] == 'map' or a[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that after finding and counting a "map" or "pie" substring, it skips over the next three characters to avoid counting them again if they form another "map" or "pie" with subsequent characters.
