Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `a`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the count of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.
4. The loop iterates through the string `a` up to the third-to-last character (`len(a) - 2`), checking for the substrings "map" and "pie".
5. If either "map" or "pie" is found, it increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1, effectively skipping over these substrings.
6. If no such substrings are found, it simply increments `i` by 1.
7. The loop ensures that the minimum number of characters are removed to make the string beautiful.
8. The final output is the count of deletions required, which matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program logic correctly implements the requirement to find the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful by removing the substrings "map" or "pie".

Correctness: **True**
