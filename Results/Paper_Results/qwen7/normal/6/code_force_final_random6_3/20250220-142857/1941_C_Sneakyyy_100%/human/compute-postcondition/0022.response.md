Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i+3` and of length 3**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 3, which changes the starting index of the substring `s`. Initially, `s` started from index `i` and had a length of 3. After executing `i += 3`, the new starting index for `s` is now `i+3`, while the length remains unchanged at 3. The value of `a` and the original length of `s` are not affected by this operation.
