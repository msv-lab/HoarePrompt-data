Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`. The function then prints the total count of these occurrences for each test case.**
