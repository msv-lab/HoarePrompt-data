Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the index 0 and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds), `s` is assigned the value of the substring `a[0:3]`, and `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
