### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into subarrays.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters (`neg`) in the string `s`.
   - It then prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` does not directly address the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not handle the splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is not derived from the problem statement and does not ensure the minimum penalty.
   - The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array, which involves dynamic programming or a similar approach to minimize the total penalty.

4. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:** `t` is read, and the loop runs `t` times.
   - **First Iteration:**
     - `n` and `s` are read.
     - `neg` is calculated as the count of `-` characters in `s`.
     - The expression `n - 2 * neg` is evaluated and printed.
     - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the penalty is `n - 2 * neg`. Otherwise, it is `n`.
   - **Postcondition of `func_1`:**
     - The function prints the result based on the condition `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise `n`.
   - **Example Test Cases:**
     - For `n = 1` and `s = '+'`, `neg = 0`, so the output is `1`.
     - For `n = 5` and `s = '-----'`, `neg = 5`, so the output is `5`.
     - For `n = 6` and `s = '+-+-+'`, `neg = 3`, so the output is `0` because `n == neg`.
     - For `n = 10` and `s = '--+++++++-'`, `neg = 7`, so the output is `6` because `n - 2 * neg = 10 - 2 * 7 = 6`.
     - For `n = 20` and `s = '+---++++-+++++---++-'`, `neg = 10`, so the output is `10` because `n - 2 * neg = 20 - 2 * 10 = 0`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The formula `n - 2 * neg` is not derived from the problem statement and does not ensure the minimum penalty. The function does not handle the splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
