Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the program only counts the number of negative signs in the string and uses this to compute the penalty, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The program would output:
```
4
```
However, the optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1], [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0`.

The program fails to consider all possible ways to split the array and does not ensure that the penalty is minimized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
