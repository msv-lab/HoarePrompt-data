Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs (t, n, s) where t is an integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 1 and 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'. For each test case defined by t, the function calculates the sum of a sequence where each element a_i is 1 if s_i is '+', and -1 if s_i is '-', and returns the sum for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases defined by `t`, and for each test case, it calculates the sum of a sequence based on the string `s`. The sequence is determined by converting each character in `s` to either 1 or -1, and then summing these values. The function returns the sum for each test case.
