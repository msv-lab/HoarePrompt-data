To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is the last character in the string `s`.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `neg` is equal to the total number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`. However, there is no explicit mention of `n` in the initial state. Therefore, we need to infer the value of `n` from the context.

Given the formula `print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)`, it suggests that `n` should be a variable that is related to the string `s` or the count of '-' characters in `s`. Since `neg` is explicitly defined as the count of '-' characters in `s`, a reasonable assumption is that `n` might also refer to the length of the string `s` or a similar relevant value.

However, without further context, we cannot definitively determine the value of `n`. But based on common programming practices and the structure of the problem, `n` is likely to be the length of the string `s`.

Let's assume `n` is the length of the string `s`:
- If `n` is the length of `s`, then `neg` is the count of '-' characters in `s`.
- The expression `n - 2 * neg` will be evaluated if `n` is not equal to `neg`.
- If `n` is equal to `neg`, then the expression simplifies to `n`.

Since we don't have the actual string `s` to determine the exact values of `n` and `neg`, we will describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the count of '-' characters in the string s)**
