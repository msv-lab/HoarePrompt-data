The function processes a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It counts the number of '-' characters in the string and calculates the value of `n - 2 * neg` where `n` is the length of the string and `neg` is the count of '-' characters. If `n` equals `neg`, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns `n - 2 * neg`. The function prints this calculated value for each test case.
