Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
