### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in the string and calculates the value of `n - 2 * neg` where `n` is the length of the string and `neg` is the count of '-' characters.
   - If `n` equals `neg`, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns `n - 2 * neg`.
   - The function prints this calculated value for each test case.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It then calls `func_1()`, which processes the string and prints the result.

3. **Optimal Penalty Calculation**:
   - According to the problem, the goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The key insight here is that the optimal strategy is to group consecutive '+' and '-' characters together because the penalty is minimized when the sum of a subarray is zero.

4. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1()` simply counts the number of '-' characters and calculates `n - 2 * neg`.
   - This calculation does not directly relate to the optimal splitting of the array.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` suggests a linear relationship between the number of '-' characters and the result, but it does not account for the optimal splitting strategy.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `10 --+++++++-`.
     - The function counts 8 '-' characters, so `neg = 8`.
     - The calculation `n - 2 * neg` gives `10 - 2 * 8 = -6`, which is incorrect.
     - The optimal splitting is `([1, -1], [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty. The original assessment is accurate because the program does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the optimal strategy for splitting the array to minimize the penalty.
