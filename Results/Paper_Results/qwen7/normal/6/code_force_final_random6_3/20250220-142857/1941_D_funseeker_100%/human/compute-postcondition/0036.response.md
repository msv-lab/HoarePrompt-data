Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` contains an element which is `(q + r) % n`, the current value of `c` is either '0' or '?'**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds an element to the set `temp`. The element added is the result of `(q + r) % n`. Since `q` and `r` are not specified, we keep them as they are. The initial state of `ans` having at least one element and the value of `c` being either '0' or '?' remains unchanged.
