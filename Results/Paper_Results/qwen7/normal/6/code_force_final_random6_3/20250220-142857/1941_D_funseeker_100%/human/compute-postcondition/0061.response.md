Output State: **`ans` now contains all the elements from `temp`, and `m` must be greater than 0; `r` is a string obtained from the first split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`**.

This means that the function `func_1()` was called, and its result was split into two strings, which were assigned to `r` and `c`. The values of `ans` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
