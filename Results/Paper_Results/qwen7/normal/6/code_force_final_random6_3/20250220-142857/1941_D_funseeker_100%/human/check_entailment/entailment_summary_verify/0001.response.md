### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly uses custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to read the input. This part is accurate.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting position `x`. This is correct as it starts with the player holding the ball.

3. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - The program iterates through each throw and updates the set `ans` to include the possible new positions based on the direction.
     - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?' (unknown), it adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n`.
     - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?' (unknown), it adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n`.
   - This logic correctly handles both known and unknown directions, ensuring all possible positions are considered.

4. **Adjustment for Zero-based Indexing**:
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if the final position is zero and adjusts it to `n` if necessary. This is a minor detail but ensures the result is within the expected range.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball and then prints these players in sorted order.
   - This matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and function summaries.
