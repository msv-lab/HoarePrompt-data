Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws and is now equal to `m - 1`, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element and is now equal to `temp`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', and `(r, c)` is a tuple where `r` is an integer and `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', and `r` is now an integer; `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `temp`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
