Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `temp` contains an element which is `(q + r) % n`, if `c` is either '0' or '?'.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `c` is '0' or '?', `ans` will retain its original property of containing at least one element with `q` as the first element, and `temp` will hold the value `(q + r) % n`.
