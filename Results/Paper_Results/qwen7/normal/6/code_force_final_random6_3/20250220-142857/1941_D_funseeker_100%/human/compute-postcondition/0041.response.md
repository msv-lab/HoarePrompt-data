Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` previously contained the element `(q + r) % n`, now it contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The variable `ans` and the value of `c` remain unchanged from the initial state.
