Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws and is now equal to `m - 1`, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element and is now equal to `temp`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', and `(r, c)` is a tuple where `r` is an integer and `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', and `r` is now an integer; `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` now contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` added to it, regardless of the value of `c` being '1' or '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, where `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `temp` holds the value `(q Â± r) % n`, depending on whether `c` is '1' or not. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q - r) % n`; otherwise, `temp` retains its original value of `(q + r) % n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
