Output State: **`c` is a character, `temp` contains the value (q + r) % n added to it, `q` is the next element in the list `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value of `(q + r) % n` to the `temp` collection. The values of `c` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states, while `temp` now includes the new value.
