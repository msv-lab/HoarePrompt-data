Output State: **`ans` now contains all the elements from `temp`, and `m` must be greater than 0; `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, and `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` to an integer. The other variables (`ans`, `m`, `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` is now an integer version of its original string value.
