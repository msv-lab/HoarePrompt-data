Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` now contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` added to it.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contained elements that were `(q + r) % n`. After executing the code, `temp` now includes both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged, containing at least one element.
