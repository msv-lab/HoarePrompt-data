Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `q` which is taken from the list `ans`.

2. **Determine the Postconditions for the Loop to Execute Again**: For the loop to execute again, `q` must be a valid element in the list `ans`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop takes `q` from `ans`, `q` must be a valid element in `ans` for the loop to continue.
   - `temp` and other variables (`m`, `r`, `c`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should include `q` being a valid element in `ans`.

**State:**
- `ans` must contain at least one element.
- `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
- `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.
- `q` is a valid element in `ans`.

However, since the exact value of `q` is not specified and it is a valid element in `ans`, we can represent it as such without specifying its exact value.

**Final State:**
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` is either '1' or '?', `q` is a valid element in `ans`**.
