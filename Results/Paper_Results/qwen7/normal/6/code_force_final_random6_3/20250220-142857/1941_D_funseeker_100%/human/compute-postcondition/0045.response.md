Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` contains elements which are `(q + r) % n` added to it, and the current value of `c` is either '1' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `ans` must contain at least one element and `c` can be either '1' or '?', these conditions are preserved.
