Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer representing the number of players.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, which must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop executed.
- `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball.
- `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws, including `n`.
- `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
- `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` could be any character ('0', '1', or '?').

The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted elements of the set `ans`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact elements of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` contains all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws, including `n`.

Given this information, the output will be the sorted elements of `ans`.

Output: **sorted elements of ans (a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after m throws, including n)**
