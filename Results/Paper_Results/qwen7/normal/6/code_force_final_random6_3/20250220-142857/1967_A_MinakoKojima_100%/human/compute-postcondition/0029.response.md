Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `ans` is adjusted based on the value of `k` relative to `dif * (i + 1)`, and `n` must be at least 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is decreased by 1, `a` is adjusted accordingly, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `dif`. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.
