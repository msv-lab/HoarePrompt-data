Output State: **`i` is not 0, `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions, the only changes are that we know we have exited the loop or conditional block. The values of `res`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged as no assignment or calculation involving these variables is performed by the `break` statement.
