The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program would exit the current context, but the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is either -3 or -1, `k` is either `-dif * 2` or 0, `ans` is either `dif` or 0.**
