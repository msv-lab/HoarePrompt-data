Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is -2, `k` is either `-dif * 2` or 0, `ans` is either `dif` or 0**

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `res`. Given that `res` was either -3 or -1, after subtracting 1, `res` becomes -2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
