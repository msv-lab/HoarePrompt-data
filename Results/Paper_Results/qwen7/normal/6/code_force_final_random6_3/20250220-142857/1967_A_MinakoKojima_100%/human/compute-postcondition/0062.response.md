Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 4, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `k` is either decreased by `dif * (i + 1)` or set to 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. This is because if `dif` equals 0, `res` is decreased by an additional 1 compared to the if part's precondition, making it decreased by 4 instead of 3.
