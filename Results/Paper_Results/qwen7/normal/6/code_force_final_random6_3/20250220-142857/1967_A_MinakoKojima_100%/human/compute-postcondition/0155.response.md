Output State: **`i` is `x + 2`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[a[i + 1] - a[i]]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `res` is `res - 1`**.

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `dif`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
