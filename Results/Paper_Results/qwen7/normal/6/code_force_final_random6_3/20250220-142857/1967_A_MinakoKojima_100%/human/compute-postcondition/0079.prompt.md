Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user split by space, `k` is an integer input by the user split by space and converted to int, `ans` is the first element of the list `a`, `res` is `n - 1`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is unchanged, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 3, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `k` is either decreased by `dif * (i + 1)` or set to 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `k` is either decreased by `dif * (i + 1) * 2` or set to 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `dif` does not equal 0, `res` remains unchanged. If `dif` equals 0, then `res` is decreased by 5 plus the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
