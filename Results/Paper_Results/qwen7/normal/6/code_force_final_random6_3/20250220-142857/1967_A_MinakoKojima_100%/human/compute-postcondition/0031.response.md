Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 1, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is decreased by 1, `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `dif`; otherwise, `k` is set to 0 and `ans` remains unchanged. The current value of `k` is 0.
