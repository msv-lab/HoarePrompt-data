Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to increment the score by redistributing the cards, but it does not properly account for the constraints and requirements of the problem.

One key issue is that the program does not ensure that after redistributing the cards, the resulting array can form the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The program calculates the score based on the sorted array and redistributes cards based on differences between consecutive elements, which does not guarantee the maximum score.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5 3
6 6 7 4 6
```

Expected output:
```
28
```

However, the program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly redistribute the cards to maximize the score. The program needs to ensure that after redistributing the cards, the resulting array has the maximum number of valid subarrays. This involves more complex logic to check and adjust the distribution of cards to achieve the highest score.

A correct implementation would involve more sophisticated algorithms to ensure that the redistribution of cards maximizes the number of valid subarrays.
