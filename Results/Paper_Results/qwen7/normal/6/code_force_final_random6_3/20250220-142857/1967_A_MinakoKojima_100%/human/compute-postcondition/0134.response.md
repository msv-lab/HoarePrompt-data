Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `res` is `res - 1`**.

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` decrements the value of `res` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, `ans`, `k`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
