Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is `k % n - 1`, `k` is not 0, `ans` is `2 * (a[2] - a[1]) + k // n`, `ans_list` contains `[2 * (a[2] - a[1]) + k // n]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ans` to `ans_list`. Since `ans` is defined as `2 * (a[2] - a[1]) + k // n`, it gets added to `ans_list`. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, `res`, `k`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
