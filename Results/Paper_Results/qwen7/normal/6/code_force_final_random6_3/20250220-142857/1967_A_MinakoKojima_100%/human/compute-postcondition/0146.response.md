Postcondition: `i` is `x + 1`, `n` is `y`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `ans` is increased by `dif` and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, and `res` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`, and if `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`.
