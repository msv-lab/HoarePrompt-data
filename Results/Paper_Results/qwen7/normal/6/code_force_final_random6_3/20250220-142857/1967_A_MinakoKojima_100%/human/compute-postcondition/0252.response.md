Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is either `dif` or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement where the conditions for `res`, `k`, and `ans` were being checked. As a result, the values of `res`, `k`, and `ans` are set according to the "Otherwise" condition, which sets `res` to -1, `k` to 0, and `ans` to either `dif` or 0. The values of `i`, `n`, and `dif` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the `break` statement.
