Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is a non-negative integer decreased by 3, `n` must be at least 1, `ans` is equal to `ans` plus `dif`, `k` is 0, `dif` is the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be its original value plus the value of `dif`. All other variables remain in their initial states or conditions, except for `ans`.
