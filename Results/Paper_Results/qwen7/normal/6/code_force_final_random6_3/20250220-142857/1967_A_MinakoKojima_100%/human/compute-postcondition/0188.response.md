Output State: **`i` is 0, `dif` is 0, `res` is -1**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]` and its current value is 0. The code `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from `res`. Since `res` was not explicitly initialized before, we assume it started with a value that, when decreased by 1, results in -1. Therefore, `res` is now -1. The values of `i` and `dif` remain unchanged.
