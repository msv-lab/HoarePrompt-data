Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -3, `k` is `-dif * 2`, `ans` is `dif`.**

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` decreases the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` was initially `-2`, after executing this line, `res` becomes `-3`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
