Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is either -3 or -1, `k` is either `-dif * 2` or 0, `ans` is either `dif` or 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `res` is set to -3 and `k` is set to `-dif * 2`, otherwise `res` is set to -1 and `k` remains 0, and `ans` is set to `dif` if `k` is `-dif * 2`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
