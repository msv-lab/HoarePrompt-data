Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `dif` is not equal to 0, `res` is -1, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Given the if condition `k == 0`, if this condition is true, the postcondition matches the if part's description. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the scenario where the if condition is met.
