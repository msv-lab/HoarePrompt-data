Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list from these integers. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
