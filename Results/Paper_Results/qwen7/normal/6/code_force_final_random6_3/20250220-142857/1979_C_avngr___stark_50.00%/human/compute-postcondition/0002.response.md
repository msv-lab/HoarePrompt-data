Output State: **`hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `hcf` and `num`, and `num` is `numbers[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `hcf` to be the GCD of `hcf` and `num`. Since `hcf` initially is `numbers[0]` and `num` is `numbers[1]`, `hcf` now holds the GCD of these two numbers. The value of `num` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
