Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `mod_x_map`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases` or `count`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `test_cases` and `count` while adding the new dictionary `mod_x_map` to the state.
