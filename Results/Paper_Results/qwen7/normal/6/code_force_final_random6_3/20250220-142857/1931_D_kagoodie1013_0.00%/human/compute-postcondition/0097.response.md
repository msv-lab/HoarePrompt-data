Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. For each tuple, it calculates the sum of count for each iteration and returns a list named results containing these sums.**

This means the function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of an array (n), two integers (x and y), and a list of n integers. It then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the sum of counts from each test case iteration.
