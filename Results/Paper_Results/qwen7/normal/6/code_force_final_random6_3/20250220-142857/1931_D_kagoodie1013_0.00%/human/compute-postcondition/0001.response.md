Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `(n, x, y, arr)` and the iterable `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - `results` is an empty list and is not part of the loop head.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. Each tuple must have four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and the loop will iterate over each tuple in `test_cases`, `test_cases` must have at least one tuple.
   - Each tuple must contain exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `test_cases` must be a non-empty list containing at least one tuple.
- Each tuple in `test_cases` must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`**
