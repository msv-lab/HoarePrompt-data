Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num` which iterates over the elements of `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since `num` is being assigned the values from `arr` one by one, the initial value of `num` should be the first element of `arr`.

3. **Initial state of `arr`**: We know that `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases`. Therefore, `arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Other variables**: The variables `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `mod_y_map` are not used within the loop and their values do not affect the loop's execution. They can remain as given.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `num` must be initialized to the first element of `arr`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`count` is 0, `n` is the next value of the first element in `test_cases`, `x` is the next value of the second element in `test_cases`, `y` is the next value of the third element in `test_cases`, `arr` is the next value of the fourth element in `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**.
