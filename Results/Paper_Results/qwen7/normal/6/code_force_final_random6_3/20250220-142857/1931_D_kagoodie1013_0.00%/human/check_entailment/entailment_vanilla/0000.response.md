Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. It then processes each test case using the `func_1` function.
4. In `func_1`, it initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
5. For each element in the array, it calculates the required remainders (`mod_x` and `mod_y`) and updates the count of beautiful pairs.
6. The logic for calculating `mod_x` and `mod_y` is correct:
   - `mod_x = -num % x` ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - `mod_y = num % y` ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
7. The final result for each test case is calculated correctly and stored in the `results` list.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
