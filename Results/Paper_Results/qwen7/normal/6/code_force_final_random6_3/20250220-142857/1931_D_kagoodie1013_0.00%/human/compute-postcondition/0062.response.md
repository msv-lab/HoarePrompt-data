Output State: **The `count` variable will hold the sum of all occurrences where the modulo operations result in keys that have been previously seen and stored in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. For each iteration, `mod_x_key` will be set to `num % x` and `mod_y_key` will be set to `num % y`. After all iterations, `mod_x_map` will contain the count of each unique `mod_x_key` encountered, and `mod_y_map` will contain the count of each unique `mod_y_key` encountered. The `results` list will have one additional element which is the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list now contains one more element, which is the final value of `count` after processing all elements in `arr`. The values of `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `mod_x_key`, `mod_y_key`, and `count` are updated according to the logic described in the initial state, but their exact values are not specified here since they depend on the input data. The only new information is the addition of the final `count` value to the `results` list.
