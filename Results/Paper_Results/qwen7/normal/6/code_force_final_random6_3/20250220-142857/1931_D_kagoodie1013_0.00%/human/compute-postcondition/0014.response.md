Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple; each tuple has exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `arr` has at least one element, and the current `num` is the first element of the next iteration's `arr`; `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary with one additional entry where `mod_y_key` maps to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

This output state reflects the changes made by the line `mod_x = -num % x`, which updates the value of `mod_x` based on the current value of `num`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
