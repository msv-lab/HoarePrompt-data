Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in arr`. This means the loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of relevant variables**:
   - `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is now 0.
   - `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `count` is 0.
   - `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `arr`, the variable `num` will take on the values from `arr`.
   - The initial state of `arr` is not specified, but since the loop will use the first element of `arr` in the first iteration, `arr` must contain at least one element.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `num` will be set to the first element of `arr` in the first iteration.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should reflect these conditions.

**State:**
**`results` is a list containing the value of `count`, which is now 0, `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, and `arr` must contain at least one element.**
