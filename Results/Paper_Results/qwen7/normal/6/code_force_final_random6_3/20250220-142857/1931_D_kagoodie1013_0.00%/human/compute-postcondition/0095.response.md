Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `results` will contain the sum of `count` for each iteration. `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will be updated for each tuple in `test_cases`, and will contain the counts of all unique remainders for each modulo operation across all arrays. `count` will be the total sum of all occurrences where the modulo operations result in keys that have been previously seen and stored in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will have been processed for all tuples in `test_cases`.**

This means that `results` will be a list where each element corresponds to the value of `count` calculated for each tuple in `test_cases`. Each `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionary will store the frequency of each possible remainder for the respective modulo operations across all numbers in the arrays provided in `test_cases`. The final `count` for each tuple will be the sum of all such occurrences, reflecting the total number of pairs of remainders that match across the arrays for each tuple in `test_cases`.
