Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple; each tuple has exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `arr` has at least one element, and the current `num` is the first element of the next iteration's `arr`; `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary with one additional entry where `mod_y_key` maps to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1; `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is updated to `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is updated to `num % y`.**

In this output state, the only change is that `mod_y_key` is updated to `num % y`. All other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
