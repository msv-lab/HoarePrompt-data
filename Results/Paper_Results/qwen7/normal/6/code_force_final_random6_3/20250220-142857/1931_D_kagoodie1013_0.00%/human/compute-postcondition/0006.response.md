Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list containing at least one tuple, each tuple must have exactly four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and `arr` must have at least one element, `count` is 0, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x` which is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `num` and `x`, `mod_x` is expressed as `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
