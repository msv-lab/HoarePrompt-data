The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. Since the variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value that affects the loop's execution, we do not need to adjust any states based on this loop head.

However, if we consider the context of the problem, the loop runs `t` times, and `t` is typically defined outside the loop. Given that no specific value for `t` or its relationship with other variables is provided in the state at the end of the previous iteration, we cannot infer any changes to the states based solely on the loop head.

Therefore, the states remain unchanged for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`queries` is a list of integers converted from input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), `result` is the result of calling `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**
