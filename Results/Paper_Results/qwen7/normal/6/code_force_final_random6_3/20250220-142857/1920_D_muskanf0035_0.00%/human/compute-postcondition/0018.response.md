Based on the initial state provided:

- `queries` is updated to a list of integers from the input.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `q` is the second integer from the input.
- `operations` is updated to a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\).
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- `t` is decreased by 1.

The `print(*result)` statement will print the elements of the `result` list, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise values of `result`. However, we know that `result` is a list returned by the function `func_1`.

Output: **result (where result is the list returned by func_1(n, operations, queries))**
