Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is updated to a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `queries = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `queries`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `operations` remain unchanged.
