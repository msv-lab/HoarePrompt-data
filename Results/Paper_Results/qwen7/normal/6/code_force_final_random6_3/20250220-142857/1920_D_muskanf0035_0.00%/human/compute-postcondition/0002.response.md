Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and `queries` is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations, `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers.**

In this output state, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged except that `n` and `q` are now assigned specific integer values from the input.
