Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `b` and `x`, and stores them in the list `operations`. The initial values of `queries`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged. The `operations` list is updated to contain `n` lists, each with two integers `b` and `x`.
