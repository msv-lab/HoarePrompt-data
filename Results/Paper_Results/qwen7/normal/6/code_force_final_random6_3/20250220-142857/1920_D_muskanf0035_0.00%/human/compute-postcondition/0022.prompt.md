You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, operations is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and queries is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, `queries` will be a list of integers from the final input, `n` will be the first integer from the final input, `q` will be the second integer from the final input, `operations` will be updated to a list of `n` lists, each containing two integers \(b\) and \(x\) where \(b \in \{1, 2\}\) and \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\), and `result` will be the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
#- `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
#- `q`: an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5.
#- `operations`: a list of n lists, each containing two integers `b` and `x` where `b` ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9.
#- `queries`: a list of q integers `k_i` where 1 ≤ `k_i` ≤ min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.
#
#The function processes `n` operations on an array and then answers `q` queries based on the final state of the array after all operations are applied. The functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept these parameters and perform the specified operations on the array, then return the results for the given queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
