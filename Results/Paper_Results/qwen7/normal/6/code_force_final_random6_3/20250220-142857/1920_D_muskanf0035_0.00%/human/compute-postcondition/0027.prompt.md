Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `array` is a list where elements are either appended based on the operation type or repeated twice depending on previous operations, `result` is an empty list, and `operations` is an empty list after all iterations.

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `array` will contain elements that were appended when `op_type` was 1, or those elements will be repeated twice if they were previously extended (based on the second part of the loop body).
- The `result` remains an empty list as no values are added to it within the loop.
- The `operations` list becomes empty since all operations have been processed.
Code of the loop:
for k in queries:
    result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queries` is a non-empty list or iterable; `result` is a list with one additional element which is the same as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `result` now contains one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `array` and `k` retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `result` now contains two additional elements: the first is the previous last element plus the new element `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `array` retains its previous value, `k` is the next element in `queries`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
