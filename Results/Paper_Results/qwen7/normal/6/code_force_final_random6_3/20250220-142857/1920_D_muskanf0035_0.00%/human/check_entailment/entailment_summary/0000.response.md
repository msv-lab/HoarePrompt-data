### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem describes a series of operations on an initially empty array \(a\). Operations include appending an integer or appending multiple copies of the current array. Queries ask for the \(k\)-th element of the final array.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process a list of operations and generate a result list based on given queries.
   - However, the provided implementation of `func_1` does not actually modify the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it creates a new list with repeated elements but does not correctly handle the operations.
   - Specifically, it appends integers directly without considering the operation types (append vs. extend).
   - It also incorrectly handles the queries by using modulo operation on the length of the array, which does not reflect the actual structure of the array after all operations.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - Function `func_2` reads the input, processes the operations using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - The issue lies in `func_1`, which is not correctly implementing the logic to build the array as per the problem description.

Given these observations, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
