Output State: **`result` now contains one additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `array` and `k` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code appends an element to the list `result`. The element being appended is calculated as `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. This means that the index from which the element is taken from `array` is `(k - 1)` modulo the length of `array`. The values of `array` and `k` remain unchanged, but `result` gains a new element.
