operations is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value). op_type is either 1 or 2, indicating the type of operation. If op_type is 1, value is an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) representing the integer to append to the array. If op_type is 2, value is an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the number of copies to append to the array. queries is a list of integers k_i (1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c)), where c is the size of the array after performing all operations.
