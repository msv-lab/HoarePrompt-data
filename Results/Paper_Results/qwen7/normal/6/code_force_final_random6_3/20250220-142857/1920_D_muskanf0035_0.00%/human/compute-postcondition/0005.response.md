Output State: **`queries` is a list of integers converted from input, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), `result` is the result of calling `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that `result` will be the return value of `func_1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
