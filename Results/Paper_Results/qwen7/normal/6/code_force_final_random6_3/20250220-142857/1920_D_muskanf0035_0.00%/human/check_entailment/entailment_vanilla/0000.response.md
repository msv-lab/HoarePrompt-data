Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: An empty list `array` is initialized.
2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation, if the operation type is 1, the value is appended to `array`.
   - If the operation type is 2, the entire `array` is extended with itself `x` times.
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, the `(k - 1)`-th element of the `array` (considering 0-based indexing) is computed using modulo operation to handle the cyclic nature of the array due to repeated extensions.
   - The result is appended to the `result` list.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q` are read.
   - The operations are read and stored in a list.
   - The queries are read and stored in a list.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - The results are printed.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles both types of operations (appending a single value and extending the array).
   - However, there is a critical issue with how the array is extended. The current implementation extends the array with itself `x` times, but it should only extend it with the current state of the array, not the initial array.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The modulo operation used to access the array elements is correct for handling the cyclic nature of the array due to repeated extensions.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement to identify the issue.

#### Example 1:
- **Operations**: 
  - `1 1`: Append 1
  - `1 2`: Append 2
  - `2 1`: Extend with the current array (which is [1, 2])
  - `1 3`: Append 3
  - `2 3`: Extend with the current array (which is [1, 2, 1, 2]) three times

- **Array State**:
  - After `1 1`: `[1]`
  - After `1 2`: `[1, 2]`
  - After `2 1`: `[1, 2, 1, 2]`
  - After `1 3`: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
  - After `2 3`: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

- **Queries**:
  - `1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20`

- **Expected Output**:
  - `1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3`

The function `func_1` incorrectly extends the array with the initial array instead of the current state of the array. This leads to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the extension of the array. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
