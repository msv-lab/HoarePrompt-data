Output State: **`result` now contains two additional elements: the first is the previous last element plus the new element `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, `array` retains its previous value, `k` is the next element in `queries`.**

This means that the `result` list has appended a new element, which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`. The `array` and `k` retain their previous values, and `result` now contains one more element than before.
