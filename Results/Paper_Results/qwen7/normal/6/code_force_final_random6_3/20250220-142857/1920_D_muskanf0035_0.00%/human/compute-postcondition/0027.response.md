Output State: **The `result` list will contain all elements from `array` that correspond to the indices specified by `queries`. The `array` and `operations` lists will be empty since no new elements are appended to `array` and all operations are processed.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `result` list will include every element from `array` that corresponds to the indices specified by each `k` in `queries`. This means if `queries` is `[1, 3, 5]`, then `result` will contain `array[0]`, `array[2]`, and `array[4]`.
- The `array` list will be empty because no new elements are appended during the loop's execution.
- The `operations` list will be empty as all operations have been processed and there are no new operations to add.
