The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing two integers `b` and `x`, and stores them in the list `operations`. The values of `n` and `q` remain unchanged, and the initial values of `operations` and `queries` are updated based on the input. However, since the actual values of `operations` and `queries` are not specified in the initial state, they remain as lists that will be populated by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `queries` is a list of q integers k_i where 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after performing all n operations, `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input.**
