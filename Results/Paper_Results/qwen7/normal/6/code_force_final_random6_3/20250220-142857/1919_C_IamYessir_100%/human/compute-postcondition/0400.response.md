Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list with one more element than before, `b` is a list with at least zero elements, `cp` is 0, and `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `x` is less than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `a` was either an empty list or a list with one element, now it becomes a list with one more element than before. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
