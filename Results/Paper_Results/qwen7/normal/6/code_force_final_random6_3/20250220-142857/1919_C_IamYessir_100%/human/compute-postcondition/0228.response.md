Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`. The last element of list `a` is appended to list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to list `a`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, appending to `a` does not affect `i`, `n`, or `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged and is still equal to the last element of list `a`.
