Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged; list `a` has its last element appended with the element at index `i` of list `lit`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `lit` to list `a`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, the element being appended is the next index after the last element of `lit` (if `lit` has such an index). The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `b`, and `lit` remain unchanged except for the modification to list `a`.
