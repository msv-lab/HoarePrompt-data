Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1 or `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 2, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `b` remains unchanged. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `b` is updated such that its last element is set to `lit[i-1]` and `i` is incremented to the length of list `b` + 2. If `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `a` is updated such that its last element is set to `lit[i]`. If `x == y`, then `a` now has its last element appended with the element from `lit` at index `i-1`.
