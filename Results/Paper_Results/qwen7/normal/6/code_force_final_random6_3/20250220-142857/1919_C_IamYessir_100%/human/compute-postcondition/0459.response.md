Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+2]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, `b` now contains one additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1]`, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1]` to the list `b`. Since `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `lit[i+1]` is an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, or the conditions related to `b` and its elements, except for adding the new element to `b`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain the same as before, with the only change being the addition of the new element to `b`.
