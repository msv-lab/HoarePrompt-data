Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the range bounds, which are `1` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - According to the problem, `i` will be equal to the length of list `b` plus 1 or 2, depending on the final comparison within the loop.
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1.

3. **Determine the Range Boundaries:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < len(a)`.
   - Therefore, the value of `len(a)` must be such that the loop can start and continue until `i` reaches `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` must be set to 1 to start the loop.
   - `len(a)` must be at least 1 to ensure the loop can run at least once.

5. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`s`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `lit`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values will be determined by the loop body. We do not need to adjust them for the loop to start.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` must be at least 1**
