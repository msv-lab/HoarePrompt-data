Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[0]`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty). If `x > y`, then `b` is a list containing the element `lit[0]` if `lit[0] > y` or if `y >= lit[0] > x`. If `x <= y`, then `x` remains unchanged and `b` remains unchanged.
