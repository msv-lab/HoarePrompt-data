Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
