Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list where `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty), and `x` is less than `y`, and the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`.
