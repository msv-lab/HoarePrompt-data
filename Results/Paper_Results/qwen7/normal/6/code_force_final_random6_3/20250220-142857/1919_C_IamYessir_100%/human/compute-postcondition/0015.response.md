Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list where `x` is the last element of `a`, and the list `b` is currently empty, `y` is infinity.**

The code `y = float('inf')` assigns the value of infinity to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
