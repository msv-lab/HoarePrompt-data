Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y`. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` and `y` becomes the last element of `b`. Otherwise, `a` gains an additional element, and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` while `lit[i]` is greater than `y`. `cp` remains 0, and `x` is greater than `y` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`. Otherwise, if `x` is greater than or equal to an element in `lit`, `a` has one additional element and `b` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than an element in `lit`, `a` may have one more element depending on the relationship between `y`, `lit[i]`, and `x`.
