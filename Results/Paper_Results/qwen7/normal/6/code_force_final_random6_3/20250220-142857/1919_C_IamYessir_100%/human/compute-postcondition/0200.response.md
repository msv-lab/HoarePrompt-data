Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1 plus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. The current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, and `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is already equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, appending an element to the list increases its length by 1. Therefore, after appending, `i` should now be equal to the new length of list `b` minus 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
