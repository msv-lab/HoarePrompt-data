Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty). If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `lit[i]`, otherwise `b` now contains the element `lit[i]`.
