Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[3]` and `lit[3]` is greater than `x`, then `x` is updated to `lit[3]` if `a` is not empty (and `a`'s last element is `lit[3]`), otherwise `x` remains infinity. If the condition `y >= lit[3] and lit[3] > x` is not met, `x` remains unchanged.
