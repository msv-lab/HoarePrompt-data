Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 2, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is either unchanged (float('inf')) or set to the last element of list `b`, and `b` and `lit` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `b`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1 from the initial state, appending an element at index `i` means that `i` will now be one more than the new length of `b`. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
