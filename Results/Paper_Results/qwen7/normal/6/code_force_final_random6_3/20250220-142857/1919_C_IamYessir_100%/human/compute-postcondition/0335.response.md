Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the loop is defined as `range(1, len(b))`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(b)` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 1 and that `i` remains less than `len(b)` throughout the loop execution.

Given the information about the final states after the loop execution, we don't need to adjust these final states because they are not part of the initial state before the loop starts.

Therefore, the only variables we need to adjust are `i` and `b`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `b` is a list such that the length of `b` is greater than 1**
