Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1. This means `i` is initially set to `len(b) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The variable `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. However, in the context of the `range` function, `n` should be a positive integer that defines the upper limit of the range. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on both `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables. Specifically, `i` should be initialized to `len(b) - 1`, and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1**
