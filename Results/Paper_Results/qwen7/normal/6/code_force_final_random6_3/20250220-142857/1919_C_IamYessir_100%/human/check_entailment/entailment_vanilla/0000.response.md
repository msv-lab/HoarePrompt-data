Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `lit`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The program initializes two lists `a` and `b` to store the elements of the array in two subsequences.
   - It uses a variable `cp` which seems unused in the current implementation.
   - The program then iterates through the array `lit` and decides whether to append each element to `a` or `b` based on the comparison with the last elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - If `a` is empty, it sets `x` to infinity.
   - If `b` is empty, it sets `y` to infinity.
   - It compares the last elements of `a` and `b` (`x` and `y`) with the current element `lit[i]`.
   - The logic for appending to `a` or `b` is not entirely clear and seems to have some issues. Specifically, the conditions for appending to `a` or `b` are not correctly implemented.

4. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - After splitting the array, the program calculates the penalty for both `a` and `b`.
   - It counts the number of indices `i` where `a[i] > a[i-1]` and `b[i] > b[i-1]`, and sums these values to get the total penalty `s`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The logic for deciding whether to append an element to `a` or `b` is flawed. The conditions used to decide the placement of elements are not consistent with the problem statement.
   - The program should aim to minimize the penalty by ensuring that the subsequences `a` and `b` are as sorted as possible.

2. **Unnecessary Complexity:**
   - The current implementation is overly complex and does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve the optimal split.

### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we need to sort the array and then split it into two subsequences such that the penalty is minimized. The optimal strategy is to split the array at the point where the number of inversions is minimized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Sort the array
        lit.sort()
        # Calculate the penalty
        penalty = sum(1 for i in range(1, n) if lit[i] > lit[i - 1])
        print(penalty)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for splitting the array. The correct approach involves sorting the array and calculating the penalty directly. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
