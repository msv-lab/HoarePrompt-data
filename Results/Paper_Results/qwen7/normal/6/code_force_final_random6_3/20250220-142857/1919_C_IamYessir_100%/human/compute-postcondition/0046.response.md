Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list where the last element is `lit[0]`, `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty), and `x` is less than or equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 0, `lit[0]` is appended to `a`. Since `a` was initially either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list where `x` is the last element of `a`, now `a` is guaranteed to be a non-empty list with its last element being `lit[0]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
