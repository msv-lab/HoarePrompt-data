Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It returns a value based on the conditions specified, which could be an error message, a specific result, or nothing if no conditions are met.**

Note: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function should validate the input constraints and return appropriate results or messages based on the given conditions.
