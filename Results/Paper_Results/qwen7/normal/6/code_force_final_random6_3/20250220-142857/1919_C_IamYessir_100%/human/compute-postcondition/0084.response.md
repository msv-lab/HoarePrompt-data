Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not; `b` is now a list containing the element from `a` at index `i-1`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `b`. Since `i` was initially 1, the element at index 1 (which is `a[1]`) is appended to `b`. After this operation, `i` increments by 1, so `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
