Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is either an empty list or a list with one element, `b` is a list with one additional element compared to its previous state (which had at least zero elements), `cp` is 0, `y` is now the last element of the updated list `b`, and the value of `x` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `b` had at least zero elements before, it now has one additional element. The value of `y` is updated to be the last element of the updated list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
