Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` is appended to list `a`, and `y` remains strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`. If `x` is not less than `y`, then `y` remains strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and `lit[i]` (which is the same as the last element of list `b`) becomes the last element of list `b`.
