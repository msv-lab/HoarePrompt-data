Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the last element of list `a`**

The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. However, since the initial state does not provide the actual list `a`, we cannot specify the exact value of `x`. But we know that `x` is now the last element of `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
