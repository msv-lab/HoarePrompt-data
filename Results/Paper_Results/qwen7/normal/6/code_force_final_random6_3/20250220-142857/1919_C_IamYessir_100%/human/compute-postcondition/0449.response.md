Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, and `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]`, otherwise `b`'s state depends on whether `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]` or `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` is a list with one more element than before (the last element is `lit[i]`), and `b`'s state depends on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, `b` now contains an additional element which is equal to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after the if-else block executes, maintaining the initial conditions and updating the states of `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` as described in both the if and else parts.
