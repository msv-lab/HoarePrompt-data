Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of integers with length 0, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `x` is positive infinity.**

The code sets `x` to positive infinity (`float('inf')`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
