Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0. If `lit[3]` is greater than `y` and `a` contains `lit[3]` as its last element, then `x` is updated to `lit[3]` if `a` is not empty. Otherwise, `x` remains the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, or infinity if `a` is empty. If `lit[3]` is not greater than `y`, `x` remains unchanged.
