Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is either an empty list or a list with one element, `b` is a list with zero elements, `cp` is 0, `y` is positive infinity, and if `a` has one element, it is the last element of the original `a` list assigned to `x`, where `x` is positive infinity if `a` is empty.**

In this case, the code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, or `x`. The precondition remains unchanged except for the introduction of `y` with the value of positive infinity.
