Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i]`, `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1] if y >= lit[i+1]`, otherwise `b` now contains an additional element which is equal to `lit[i+1] if y >= lit[i+1] and lit[i+1] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the integer value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, or the conditions related to `b` and `x`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain as they were before the execution of the code, except for the updated list `a` which now includes the new element.
