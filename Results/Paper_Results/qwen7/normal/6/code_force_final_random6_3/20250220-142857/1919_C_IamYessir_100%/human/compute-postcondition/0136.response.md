Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. If `lit[3]` is greater than or equal to `x` and `a` contains `lit[3]` as its last element, then `x` is updated to `lit[3]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` remains infinity. If `lit[3]` is less than `x` or `a` does not contain `lit[3]` as its last element, then `x` remains unchanged. Additionally, `b` remains unchanged regardless of the condition.
