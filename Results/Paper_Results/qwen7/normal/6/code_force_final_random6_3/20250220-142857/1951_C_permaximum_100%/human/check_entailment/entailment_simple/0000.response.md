Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the priority queue (`pq`) with the prices and their corresponding indices.
2. It uses a while loop to ensure that the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches the required number (`k`).
3. For each iteration, it pops the element with the lowest price from the priority queue, calculates the new price after any previous price increases, and determines the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining number of tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
4. It then updates the total cost (`total_cost`) and increments the `price_increase` for subsequent days.
5. The loop continues until the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought.
6. After the loop, the function returns the `total_cost`, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the annotated program, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
