Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to calculate the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets given the constraints.
2. The function initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples of ticket prices and their corresponding days. This helps in always processing the cheapest ticket first.
3. It iterates through the tickets, buying up to `m` tickets per day and updating the total cost and the cumulative price increase accordingly.
4. The logic inside the loop correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days when tickets are purchased.
5. The function returns the total cost once `k` tickets have been bought.
6. The provided example and the state of the program before the function call match the expected behavior of the function.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
