#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, m is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, k is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and prices is a list of n positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: Output State: `total_cost` is the sum of `price * tickets_to_buy` for each iteration until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`, `pq` is an empty heap (since all elements are processed), `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `price_increase` is the cumulative increase in price over all iterations, `price` is the final price after all increments, `day` is the last day's value popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought` during the last iteration, and `pq` is an empty heap because it has been fully processed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total_cost` will be the total expenditure to buy `k` tickets considering the price increases each day, `pq` will be empty as all elements were processed, `tickets_bought` will equal `k` indicating all required tickets have been bought, and `price_increase` will reflect the total increment in ticket price throughout the process.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns the total cost to buy `k` tickets considering the price increases each day, with `pq` being an empty heap since all elements were processed, `tickets_bought` equaling `k` indicating all required tickets have been bought, and `price_increase` reflecting the total increment in ticket price throughout the process.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the number of tickets to be bought), and `prices` (a list of ticket prices for each day). It calculates the total cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the price increases each day. After processing all days, it returns the total cost. During the process, it ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought each day and updates the total cost accordingly. The function also keeps track of the cumulative price increase over the days.
