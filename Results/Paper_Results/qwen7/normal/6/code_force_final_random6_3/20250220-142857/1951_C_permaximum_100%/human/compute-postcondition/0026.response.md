Output State: `total_cost` is the sum of `price * tickets_to_buy` for each iteration, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, `price_increase` is the sum of `tickets_to_buy` for each iteration, `pq` is an empty heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `day` is the last day from which tickets were purchased, `price` is the final price after all increases, `tickets_to_buy` is the remaining quantity needed to reach `k` after the last purchase.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `total_cost` will be the cumulative cost of buying `tickets_bought` tickets, which should equal `k`. The `pq` heap will be empty since all elements have been processed. `price_increase` will reflect the total increase in price due to the loop's iterations. The loop terminates when `tickets_bought` reaches `k`, so `tickets_bought` will be exactly `k`.
