Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap.**

Explanation: The code `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `pq`. After the operation, `pq` contains one less element. The values of `price` and `day` are set to the values of the smallest element that was removed from the heap. The other variables remain unchanged.
