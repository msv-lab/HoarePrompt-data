Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the number of tickets to be bought), and `prices` (a list of ticket prices for each day). It calculates the total cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the price increases each day. After processing all days, it returns the total cost. During the process, it ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought each day and updates the total cost accordingly. The function also keeps track of the cumulative price increase over the days.**
