Output State: **`total_cost` is increased by `price * tickets_to_buy`, `pq` is a heap with one less element, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is updated to `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the price popped from the heap, `day` is the day popped from the heap, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `price` is `price + price_increase`, `tickets_bought` is increased by `tickets_to_buy`, and `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy < k`. `total_cost` is now `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`.**

In simpler terms:
- The `total_cost` is increased by the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
