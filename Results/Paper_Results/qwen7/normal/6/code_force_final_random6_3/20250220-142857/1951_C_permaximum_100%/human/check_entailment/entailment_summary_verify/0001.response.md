### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of prices.
   - This part of the assessment is accurate.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices and their corresponding indices.
   - This is done using `heapq.heapify`, which is appropriate for finding the minimum cost.
   - This part of the assessment is accurate.

3. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The program uses a while loop to keep buying tickets until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - For each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the heap, adjusts the price by adding `price_increase`, and calculates how many tickets can be bought (`tickets_to_buy`).
   - It then updates the total cost and increases the `price_increase` accordingly.
   - This part of the assessment is accurate.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of tickets to buy exceeds the number of available tickets in a single day by limiting the number of tickets to `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
   - The logic ensures that the price increase is applied correctly after purchasing tickets on a particular day.
   - This part of the assessment is accurate.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case.
   - This part of the assessment is accurate.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a subtle issue with the logic that could lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Specifically, the logic for updating the `price_increase` might not be correctly reflecting the problem constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- The function `func_1` aims to minimize the total cost of buying `k` tickets by considering the price increases each day.
- The key issue lies in the calculation of `price_increase`. The function updates `price_increase` by adding the number of tickets bought each day, but this might not reflect the actual price increase correctly.

Consider the following scenario:
- Suppose `prices = [1, 2, 3]`, `m = 2`, and `k = 3`.
- On the first day, the minimum price is 1. Buying 2 tickets would cost 2, and the price for the next day would increase by 2.
- On the second day, the new prices would be `[3, 5]`. Buying 1 more ticket would cost 3, and the price for the next day would increase by 1.
- The total cost would be `2 + 3 = 5`.

However, the current implementation might incorrectly update `price_increase` and lead to a higher cost.

### Corrected Implementation:

To ensure the correct calculation of the price increase, we need to adjust the logic to correctly reflect the price changes after each purchase.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import heapq

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        # Update price_increase correctly
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Adjust prices for the next day
        for i in range(day + 1, n):
            prices[i] += tickets_to_buy
    return total_cost
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the correct approach and logic, but there is a subtle issue with the `price_increase` calculation that needs to be addressed. The corrected implementation ensures that the price increase is correctly reflected.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
