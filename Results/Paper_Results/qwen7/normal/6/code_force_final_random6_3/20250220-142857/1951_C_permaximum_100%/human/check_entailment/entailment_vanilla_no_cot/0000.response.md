Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending required to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the prices and their corresponding days. This helps in always processing the cheapest available ticket first.

2. **Processing Days**: For each day, the program checks the current price and calculates how many tickets can be bought without exceeding the remaining number of tickets (`k`). It updates the total cost accordingly and adjusts the price increase for subsequent days.

3. **Heap Operations**: Using a heap ensures that the program always processes the cheapest ticket first, which is crucial for minimizing the overall cost.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the available tickets on a particular day by limiting the number of tickets to `m`.

5. **Output**: The function returns the total cost after processing all necessary tickets.

Given the structure and logic of the code, it should correctly compute the minimum cost for purchasing `k` tickets across `n` days with the specified constraints. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
