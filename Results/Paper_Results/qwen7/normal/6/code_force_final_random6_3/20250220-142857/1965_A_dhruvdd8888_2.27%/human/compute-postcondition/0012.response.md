Output State: **`cd` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by its original elements, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cd` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables or the list `nums`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `cd`.
