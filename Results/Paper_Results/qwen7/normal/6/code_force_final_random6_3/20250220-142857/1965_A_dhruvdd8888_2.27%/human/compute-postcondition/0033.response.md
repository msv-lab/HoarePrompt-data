Output State: **`cd` is either 1 or 0, `i` is the index where the condition `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] != 1` is first met, or `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 3` if the condition is never broken.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `cd` will be incremented each time the condition `nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1` is true. The loop breaks as soon as this condition is false. Therefore, `cd` will count the number of consecutive pairs of elements in `nums` that differ by exactly 1. The variable `i` will be the index right after the last pair of elements that satisfied the condition, or it will be equal to `len(nums) - 3` if the condition was true for all pairs up to the second last element.
