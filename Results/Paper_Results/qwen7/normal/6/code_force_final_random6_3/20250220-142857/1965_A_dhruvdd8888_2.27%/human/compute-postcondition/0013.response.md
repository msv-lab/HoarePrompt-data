Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(len(nums) - 2)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`.
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until it reaches `len(nums) - 2`.

3. **Initial state of `nums`**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by its original elements.
   - The length of `nums` is greater than 3.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, `i` must be set to 0.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(nums) - 2`. Therefore, `len(nums) - 2` should be greater than or equal to 0 (which is always true given that the length of `nums` is greater than 3).

5. **Other variables**:
   - `cd` is 0, but it is not involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` must be 0.
- `len(nums) - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0 (which is always true since the length of `nums` is greater than 3).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`cd` is 0, `i` is 0, `len(nums) - 2` must be greater than or equal to 0**
