### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones `k` from each non-empty pile, with `k` being at most the size of the smallest non-empty pile. The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for this game is based on the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the second player has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player has a winning strategy.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the main loop.
   - The variable `nums` is initialized as a set of strings split from an input line, which is then converted to integers and sorted.
   - The logic inside `func_1()` checks the length of `nums` and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not correctly reflect the game's rules.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes a series of test cases. It reads a set of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, sorts them, and then determines whether to print 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions. If the count of consecutive integers starting from the second element is odd, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value but prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`3 3 3 3 3`), the code correctly identifies Alice as the winner because she can remove 3 stones from each pile, making all piles empty.
   - For the second test case (`1 7`), the code incorrectly identifies Bob as the winner because it does not correctly simulate the game's moves.
   - For other test cases, the code also fails to correctly determine the winner.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and thus does not produce the expected results for all test cases. The function summary suggests that the function is based on counting consecutive integers, which is not the correct approach for determining the winner in this game.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic for determining the winner based on the game rules. The function summary is misleading and does not accurately describe the intended logic.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
