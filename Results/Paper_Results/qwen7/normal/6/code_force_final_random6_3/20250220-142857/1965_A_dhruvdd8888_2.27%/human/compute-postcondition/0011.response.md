Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by its original elements, and the length of `nums` is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code inserts the value `0` at index `0` of the list `nums`. Since `nums` was initially a list of integers sorted in ascending order with a length greater than 2, after inserting `0`, `nums` will start with `0` followed by its original elements, and the length of `nums` will now be greater than 3.
