Output State: **The program prints 'Alice'**

The code snippet `return print('Alice')` does not return a value but instead calls the `print` function with the argument `'Alice'`. Since the `print` function outputs the given argument to the console, the program will print 'Alice' to the console. However, since there is no explicit `return` statement returning a value, the return value itself is `None`. But as per the instruction, we focus on the action performed, which is printing 'Alice'.
