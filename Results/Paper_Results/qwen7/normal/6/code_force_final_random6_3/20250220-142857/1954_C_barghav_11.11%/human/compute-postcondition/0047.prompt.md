Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, `a` will be a list of integers where each element has been transformed according to the rules defined within the loop. Specifically, for the first half of the list (up to the middle), the elements will be swapped such that the smaller value moves to `b` and the larger value remains in `a`. For the second half of the list, the elements will also be swapped but in reverse order, meaning the larger value moves to `b` and the smaller value remains in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(a[i], end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `len(a)` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `len(a)` must be greater than 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
