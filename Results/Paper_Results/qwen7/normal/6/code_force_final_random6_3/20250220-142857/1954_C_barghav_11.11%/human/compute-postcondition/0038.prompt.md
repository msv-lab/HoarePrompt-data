Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from the input string, `b` is a list of characters from the input().
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of the list `a` minus one, `a[i]` is updated to `m`, where `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `b[i]` is updated to `n`, where `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `i` is greater than half the length of the list `a` minus one, `a[i]` is updated to `m`, where `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` (which is now `m`) and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer that is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers. If `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one, the value at index `i` in `a` is replaced by `n`, and `m` is the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `n`, while `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `n`. Otherwise, the value at index `i` in `a` is set to `m`, which is the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`, where `b` is a list with the same elements as `a` except that the value at index `i` is replaced by `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is one more than the previous value, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index `i` is either equal to `n` (if `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `a` minus one) or equal to `m` (where `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`). `m` is the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
