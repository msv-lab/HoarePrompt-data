You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, `a` will be a list of integers where each element has been transformed according to the rules defined within the loop. Specifically, for the first half of the list (up to the middle), the elements will be swapped such that the smaller value moves to `b` and the larger value remains in `a`. For the second half of the list, the elements will also be swapped but in reverse order, meaning the larger value moves to `b` and the smaller value remains in `a`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, and `a` will be a list of integers where each element has been transformed according to the specified rules. Specifically, for the first half of the list (up to the middle), the elements will be swapped such that the smaller value moves to `b` and the larger value remains in `a`. For the second half of the list, the elements will also be swapped but in reverse order, meaning the larger value moves to `b` and the smaller value remains in `a`.
    #
    #This transformation ensures that after the loop completes, the list `a` is modified based on the comparison and swapping logic described, with `i` reflecting the total length of the list `a`.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of list `b`, and `a` will be a list of integers where each element has been transformed according to the specified rules. Specifically, for the first half of the list (up to the middle), the elements will be swapped such that the smaller value moves to `b` and the larger value remains in `a`. For the second half of the list, the elements will also be swapped but in reverse order, meaning the larger value moves to `b` and the smaller value remains in `a`. The loop iterates over the entire length of `b`, ensuring that all elements in `a` are processed and transformed as per the described logic.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will be the length of `b`, and `a` will have been modified so that for the first half of the list, smaller values are moved to `b` and larger values remain in `a`, while for the second half, larger values are moved to `b` and smaller values remain in `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. Specifically, the swapping logic in `func_1()` is flawed. The current implementation swaps the smallest digit in `a` with the largest digit in `b` if the index is less than or equal to half the length of the string, and vice versa. This approach does not guarantee that the product of `x` and `y` will be maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
123
456
```

The program outputs:
```
321
654
```

However, the optimal solution would be:
```
321
645
```

This is because swapping the second digit (2 and 5) results in a higher product compared to swapping the first digit (1 and 4). Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum product, making it incorrect.
