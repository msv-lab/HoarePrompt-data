Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `b` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements. Since it's a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, let's denote the first element as `b[0]` and the second element as `b[1]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet is `print(b[i], end='')`.
   - Given `i = 1`, the expression `b[i]` refers to the second element of the list `b`.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - Since `b` has at least 2 elements, `b[1]` will be one of those elements.
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means no newline will be added after printing `b[1]`.

Based on the above steps, the output will be the second element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[1]**
