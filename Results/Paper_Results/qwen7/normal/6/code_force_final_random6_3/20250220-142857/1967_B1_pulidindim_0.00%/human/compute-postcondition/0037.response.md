Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is the value read from `int(input())`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`.
   - `m` is greater than `count - 1`.
   - `count` is `m + 1`.
   - `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1) + (n / 3 + 1) + ... + (n / (m - 1) + 1)`.
   - `countmins` is 0.
   - `g` is `n / m`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 2.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. However, the only variables that can be adjusted according to the loop head are `i` and `t`.

Given these points, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is greater than `count - 1`, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1) + (n / 3 + 1) + ... + (n / (m - 1) + 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / m`**.
