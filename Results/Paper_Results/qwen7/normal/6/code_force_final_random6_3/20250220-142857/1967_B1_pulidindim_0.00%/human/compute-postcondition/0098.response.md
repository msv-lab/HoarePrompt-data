The only variable in the loop head is `count`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count`. If `count` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 5. For the loop to be executed one more time, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `count` is less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`count` is less than or equal to `m`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4 - 3`, `ans` is `ans + (g / 5 + 1)`**
