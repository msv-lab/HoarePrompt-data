Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 4, `n` is the new integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `(29 * n / 16) + (m - 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / (m + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and splits them. The first integer is assigned to `n` and the second integer is assigned to `m`. The values of `t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, and `countmins` remain unchanged. The value of `g` is recalculated based on the new value of `n`.
