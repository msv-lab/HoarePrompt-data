The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The previous values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` are still valid. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, while `n` and `m` are updated to the new values entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 3, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is the second integer input split from `input().split()`, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 + 1) + (n / 3 + 1) + ... + (n / (m - 1) + 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / m`**
