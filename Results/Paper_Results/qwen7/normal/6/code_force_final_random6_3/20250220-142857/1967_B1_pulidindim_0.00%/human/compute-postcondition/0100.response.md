Output State: **`count` is less than or equal to `m`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `n / count`, `ans` is `ans + (n / (4 * count) - 3 / 5 + 1)`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `g` is updated to `n / count`.
- The variable `ans` is updated to `ans + (g / 5 + 1)`, which becomes `ans + (n / (5 * count) - 3 / 5 + 1)` considering `g = n / count`.
