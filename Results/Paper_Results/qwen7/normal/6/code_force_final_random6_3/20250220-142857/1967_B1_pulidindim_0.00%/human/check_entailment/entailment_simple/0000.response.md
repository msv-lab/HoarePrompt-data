Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization**: The initial value of `count` is set to 2, and `ans` is initialized to `n`. This initialization seems to be a mistake since the problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. The correct initialization should consider the pair `(1, 1)` which always satisfies the condition.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from `count = 2` to `count = m + 1`. For each `count`, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count - countmins + 1`. However, this logic does not correctly implement the required condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Updating `ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` for each iteration. This approach does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

5. **Output**: The final value of `ans` is printed, which is supposed to represent the number of valid pairs. Given the incorrect logic, this output is likely incorrect.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for counting valid pairs is flawed, and the implementation does not adhere to the required conditions.

Correctness: **False**
