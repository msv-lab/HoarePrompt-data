Output State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 4, `n` is the new integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 1, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / (m + 1)`, `g` is updated to `n / count` where `count` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `n / count`. Since `count` is 1, `g` becomes `n / 1`, which simplifies to `n`. Therefore, `g` is now equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
