Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is the value read from `int(input())`
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`
   - `m` is at least 3
   - `count` is `m + 1`
   - `ans` is `(29n / 16) + (m - 1)`
   - `countmins` is 0
   - `g` is `n / (m + 1)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 4.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is determined by the input and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is the value read from `int(input())`, `i` is 4, `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`, `m` is at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `(29n / 16) + (m - 1)`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / (m + 1)`**
