You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases, a and b are lists of integers where a_i and b_i represent the costs for Kirill to move past the i-th person in the queue, n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, and the lengths of a and b are both equal to n.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `pergunta` will be the minimum value it has taken during all iterations (starting from its initial value and updating whenever `x + a[i]` is smaller), and `x` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of arrays `a` and `b` from index `n-1` to `m`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `pergunta` will hold the smallest possible value of `x + a[i]` encountered during the loop, and `x` will be the cumulative sum of the smaller cost between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` down to `m`.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value of x + a[i] encountered during the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts five parameters: `pergunta` (an integer), `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), `n` (an integer), and `m` (an integer). It returns a value based on the conditions provided. If `pergunta` is less than 0 or greater than the length of list `a` (or `b`), the function returns an error message indicating an invalid test case. Otherwise, it processes the lists `a` and `b` according to the given constraints and returns a specific value or message.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
