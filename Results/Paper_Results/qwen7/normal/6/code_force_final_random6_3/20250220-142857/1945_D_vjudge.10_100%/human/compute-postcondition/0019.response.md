Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `pergunta` will be the minimum value it has taken during all iterations (starting from its initial value and updating whenever `x + a[i]` is smaller), and `x` will be the sum of the minimum values between corresponding elements of arrays `a` and `b` from index `n-1` to `m`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `pergunta` will hold the smallest possible value of `x + a[i]` encountered during the loop, and `x` will be the cumulative sum of the smaller cost between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` down to `m`.
