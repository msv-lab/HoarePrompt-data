Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pergunta` to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Since `i` is `n-2`, the value of `i` does not change. The value of `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. The initial conditions and relationships among the variables remain valid.
