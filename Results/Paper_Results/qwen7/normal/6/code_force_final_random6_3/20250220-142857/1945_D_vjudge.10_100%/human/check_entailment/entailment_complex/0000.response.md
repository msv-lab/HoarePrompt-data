Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is verified by the loop that iterates over the number of test cases (`numCasos`).

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n` and `m` are correctly initialized with the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. The lists `a` and `b` are correctly populated with the respective costs.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments, which are the current value of `pergunta`, the lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m`.

4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward through the list `a` from index `n-1` to `m`.
   - It updates `pergunta` with the minimum value between its current value and `x + a[i]` when `i < m`.
   - It accumulates the minimum cost between `a[i]` and `b[i]` into `x` for each iteration.
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum cost Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is within the first `m` positions.

5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the minimum cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the program logic and the function implementation align with the problem statement and the expected behavior. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
