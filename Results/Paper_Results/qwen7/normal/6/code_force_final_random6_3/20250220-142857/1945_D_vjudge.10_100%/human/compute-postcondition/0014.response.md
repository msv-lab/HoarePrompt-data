Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `pergunta` is the minimum between the current value of `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pergunta` to be the minimum between its current value and `x + a[i]`. Since `i` is `n-3`, the value of `a[i]` is known, and the value of `pergunta` is updated accordingly. The values of `x` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the updated value of `pergunta` reflects the new minimum.
