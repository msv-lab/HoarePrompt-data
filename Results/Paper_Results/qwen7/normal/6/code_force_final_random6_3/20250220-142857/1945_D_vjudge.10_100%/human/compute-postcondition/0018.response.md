Output State: The variable `i` will be `-1`, `pergunta` will be the minimum value it attained during all iterations of the loop, considering the expression `x + a[i]` when `i < m`, and `x` will be the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have decremented to `-1` (since it starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches `-1`). The variable `pergunta` will hold its smallest value encountered during the loop, which is updated whenever `i < m` and the condition `pergunta > x + a[i]` is met. Finally, `x` will be the cumulative sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` down to `0`.
