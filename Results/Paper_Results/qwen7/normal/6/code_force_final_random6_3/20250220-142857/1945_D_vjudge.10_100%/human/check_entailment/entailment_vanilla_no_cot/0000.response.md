Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
3. **Dynamic Calculation**: The function `func_1` iterates through the list `a` from the last element to the first. It calculates the cumulative cost `x` of moving Kirill to the current position and updates `pergunta` with the minimum cost required to ensure Kirill is within the first `m` positions.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The logic in the function `func_1` ensures that the cost is calculated correctly by considering both the direct cost `a[i]` and the intermediate costs `b[k]` for `j < k < i`. This approach guarantees that the minimum cost is found efficiently.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program handles all cases correctly.
