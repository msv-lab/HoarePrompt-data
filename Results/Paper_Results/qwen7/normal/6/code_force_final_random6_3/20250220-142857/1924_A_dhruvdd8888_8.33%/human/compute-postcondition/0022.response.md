Postcondition: `win` is a set of integers containing the element `i`, `us` is a set of integers, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`, `ps` is 2, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `s` is the same set, because either `win` is an empty set or the condition `len(win) == k` does not hold, leading to no change in the state of the variables.
