Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the set `s`.
   - The postcondition given tells us what happens inside the loop based on whether `i` is in `us` or not.

3. **Analyze the postcondition**:
   - If `i` is in `us`, then `win` remains unchanged, `us`, `ans`, `ps`, `i`, and `s` are updated as specified in the if part.
   - If `i` is not in `us`, then there is no change in the else part.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `s`, and `s` is the same set, `i` will be the next element in `s` in the next iteration.
   - `s` remains the same set.

Given this analysis, the only variable that changes is `i`, which becomes the next element in `s`. All other variables (`win`, `us`, `ans`, `ps`, and `s`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `win` is a set of integers, `us` is a set of integers, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`, `ps` is 2, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `s` is the same set.**
