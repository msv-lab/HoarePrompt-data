Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if a set of characters (formed by the first `k` lowercase English alphabets) appears in the string `s` as a subsequence. However, the current implementation only checks if a subset of these characters forms a subsequence and does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
ccc
```

This is because the program only checks if the set of characters `{a, b, c}` forms a subsequence, but it does not verify if all possible strings of length 3 (e.g., `abc`, `acb`, etc.) are subsequences of `s`. The program incorrectly assumes that if a subset of characters forms a subsequence, then all possible strings can be formed as subsequences, which is not necessarily true.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for certain cases, making it incorrect.
