Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n and k (both integers between 1 and 26), m (an integer between 1 and 1000), and s (a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets). It does not return any value but checks if the string s contains at least n distinct characters from the first k lowercase English alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and appends missing characters to the end of the string s, each followed by 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.**
