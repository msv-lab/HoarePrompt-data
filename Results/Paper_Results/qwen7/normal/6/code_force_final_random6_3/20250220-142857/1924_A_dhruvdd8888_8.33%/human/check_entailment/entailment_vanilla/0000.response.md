Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1()` is defined but never called directly in the main loop. This function is supposed to handle the logic for checking subsequences.
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside a loop, but the loop variable `_` is not used, which suggests a potential issue.

3. **Main Logic in `func_1()`:**
   - The function takes `n`, `k`, and `m` as inputs.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It uses a set `win` to keep track of characters seen so far.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if characters are in `us`. If they are, it adds them to `win` until `win` has all `k` characters.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and clears `win`.
   - After processing the string, it checks if `ps` (number of times `win` was fully populated) is at least `n`.
     - If yes, it prints "YES".
     - If no, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Constructing the Non-Subsequence String:**
   - If "NO" is printed, it constructs a string by taking the first character of `ans` (which is a valid subsequence), appending a non-matching character from `us`, and padding with 'a' to make the string of length `n`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Unnecessary Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called correctly. The loop should call `func_1()` with the appropriate arguments.
   
2. **Potential Logical Error:**
   - The logic for constructing the non-subsequence string might not always work as intended. Specifically, the constructed string might not be a valid subsequence of `s` if `s` is very short or the characters are not distributed properly.

### Corrected Program:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        for i in us:
            if i not in win:
                print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
                break
```

### Conclusion:
After making the necessary corrections, the program now correctly handles the logic for checking if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Therefore, the original program needs these corrections to be considered correct.

**Correctness: False**
