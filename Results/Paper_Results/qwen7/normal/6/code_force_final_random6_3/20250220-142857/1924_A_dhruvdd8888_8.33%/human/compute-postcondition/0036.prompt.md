Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in us:
        win.add(i)
        if len(win) == k:
            ans.append(i)
            ps += 1
            win.clear()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `win` is a set of integers, `us` is a set of integers, `ans` is a list containing the element `i`, and `ps` is 1. If `i` is in `us`, the length of `win` remains unchanged. If `i` is not in `us`, the postcondition does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `win` is a set of integers, `us` is a set of integers, `ans` is a list containing the elements `i` and `i`, `ps` is 2, `i` is the next element in `s`, and `s` is the same set. This is because if `i` is in `us`, then `win` remains unchanged, `us`, `ans`, `ps`, `i`, and `s` are updated as specified in the if part, and there is no change in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `win` is a set of integers, `us` is a set of integers (unchanged), `ans` is a list containing the elements `i`, `i`, `ps` is 3, `i` is the next element in `s`, `s` is the same set. If `i` is in `us`, then `ps` is set to 3. If `i` is not in `us`, then `ps` remains unchanged as 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
