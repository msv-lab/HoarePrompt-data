Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `win` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `ans` is a list containing exactly `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `ps` is `m`.
   - `i` is the first element in `us` but not in `win`.
   - `s` is the same set as `us`, with `ps` being less than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `ans` is a list of `m` elements, each being one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Let's denote these elements as `a1, a2, ..., am`.
   - `''.join(ans)` concatenates these elements into a single string.
   - `i` is the first element in `us` but not in `win`. Since both `win` and `us` contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` must be the smallest letter that is in `us` but not in `win`. Given that `win` contains the first `k` letters, `i` would be the `(k+1)`-th letter, which is the letter right after the last letter in `win`.
   - `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` generates a string consisting of `n - m - 1` 'a' characters.

4. **Putting it Together:**
   - The print statement concatenates the string representation of `ans`, the character `i`, and the string of `n - m - 1` 'a' characters.

Given this breakdown, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - m - 1)**

Where:
- `ans` is a list of `m` elements from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` is the `(k+1)`-th lowercase English alphabet letter.
- `n - m - 1` is the number of 'a' characters appended to the end.
