Output State: **`win` is a set of integers containing the next element in `s`; `us` is a set of integers (unchanged); `ans` is a list containing the elements `i`, `i`; `ps` is 2; `i` is the next element in `s`; `s` is the same set.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is the next element in `s`, and initially `ans` contains the elements `i` and `i`, after appending `i` again, `ans` will contain `[i, i, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
