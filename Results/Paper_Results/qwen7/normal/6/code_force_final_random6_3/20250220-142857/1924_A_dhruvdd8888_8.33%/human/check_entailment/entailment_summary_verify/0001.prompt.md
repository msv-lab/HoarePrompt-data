You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters: n and k (both integers between 1 and 26), m (an integer between 1 and 1000), and s (a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets). It does not return any value but checks if the string s contains at least n distinct characters from the first k lowercase English alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and appends missing characters to the end of the string s, each followed by 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is likely an error since the function is not called after defining it.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop iterates `t` times, reading `n`, `k`, and `m` for each test case.
   - It then reads the string `s`.

4. **Set Initialization:**
   - `us` is initialized as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is a set to keep track of the characters seen so far.
   - `ans` is a list to store the sequence of characters forming a valid subsequence.
   - `ps` is a counter to count the number of unique characters added to `win`.

5. **Processing the String `s`:**
   - The program iterates through each character in `s`.
   - If the character is in `us`, it adds the character to `win`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans`, increments `ps`, and clears `win`.

6. **Checking Validity:**
   - After processing `s`, it checks if `ps` (number of unique characters added) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` using characters from `us` that are not in `win`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Unused Function:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called. This should be removed or called appropriately.

2. **Logic for Constructing the Result String:**
   - The logic for constructing the result string when "NO" is printed is flawed. It constructs a string using characters from `us` that are not in `win` but does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid subsequence of `s`.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Find a valid subsequence of length n that is not in s
        for i in us:
            if i not in win:
                break
        # Construct a string of length n using characters from us
        result = ''.join([i] * n)
        print(result)

```

### Conclusion

After addressing the issues, the program now correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate output. Therefore, the original program needs adjustments but can be made correct.

**Correctness:** **False** (before correction)  
**Correctness:** **True** (after correction)
