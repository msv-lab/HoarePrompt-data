Output State: **`position` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is half of its original value (non-zero even number)**.

Explanation: The code `position += 1` increments the value of `position` by 1. Initially, `position` is 1, so after executing the code, `position` becomes 2. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
