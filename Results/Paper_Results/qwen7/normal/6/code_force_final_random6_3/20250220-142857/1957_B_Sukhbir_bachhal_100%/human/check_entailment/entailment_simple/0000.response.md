Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case with `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Integer Case**: For the case where `n == 1`, the program prints `k` directly, which is correct since the only number to be printed must sum to `k`.

3. **Multiple Integers Case**: For the case where `n > 1`, the program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. It does this by:
   - Setting the first element to `2^counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit that fits within the value of `k`.
   - Setting the second element to `k - (2^counter - 1)`, ensuring the sum of the first two elements equals `k`.
   - Filling the rest of the array with zeros.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the highest power of 2 that fits into `k` by right-shifting `k` until it becomes zero, counting the shifts.
   - The function returns `position - 1`, which gives the highest bit position that is set in `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is 0, `func_1` correctly returns `-1`, but this case is not used in the main logic.
   - For other values of `k`, the function correctly identifies the highest bit position.

6. **Binary OR Operation**:
   - The strategy of setting the first element to `2^counter - 1` ensures that it has the maximum possible number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - Subtracting this from `k` gives the second element, which also contributes to maximizing the number of 1s in the OR result.
   - Adding zeros for the remaining elements ensures the sum constraint is met.

7. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the sequence in the required format, with each element separated by spaces.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence while ensuring the sum constraint is met.

Correctness: **True**
