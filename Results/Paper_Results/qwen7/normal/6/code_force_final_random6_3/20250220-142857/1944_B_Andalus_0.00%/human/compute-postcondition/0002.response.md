Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, `_` is now 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial value of `_` remains unchanged, and the value of `T` is also unaffected. Therefore, `T` must still be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `_` is still 1. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers input by the user.
