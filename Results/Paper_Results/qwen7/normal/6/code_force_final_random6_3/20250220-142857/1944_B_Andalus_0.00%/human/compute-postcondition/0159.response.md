Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `rdb`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables with their respective values, and adds that `rdb` is now an empty list.
