Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
- The current element being processed is the next element in `rdb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `sz` can only be 0 or 2, it will never be greater than or equal to `k` (assuming `k` is a positive integer), so the loop or if statement will continue to process the next element in `rdb`.

Given this, the `elem` variable refers to the current element being processed from the `rdb` iterable. Since `rdb` is non-empty, `elem` will be the first element of `rdb`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the current element twice, followed by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
