Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty collection, the first element of `sng` is `elem` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the value of `sng` or `elem`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified in the code snippet, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
