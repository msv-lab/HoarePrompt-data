Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, and there are no specific requirements for the contents of `sng` as it is not mentioned in the provided loop and its conditions.

In Natural Language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will hold the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times. The list `rdb` will contain all elements from the list `rgt` that are identical to their preceding element, starting from the second element of `rgt`. The list `sng` is not modified by this loop and thus retains its original state, containing all unique elements from `lft` that are not part of any consecutive duplicates.
