Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `ldb` now contains the value of `lft[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is 1, `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `n` must be greater than 1, the value of `ldb` is updated to include `lft[1]`, which is the same as `lft[0]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
