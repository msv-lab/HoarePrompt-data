Output State: **`sz` is 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the value of `k - sz` is at least 4.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, making it 2. The value of `rdb` remains a non-empty iterable as no changes were made to it. Additionally, since `k - sz` was initially at least 2, after incrementing `sz` by 2, the new condition is that `k - sz` is at least 4.
