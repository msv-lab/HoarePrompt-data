Based on the initial state provided, `ldb` is a non-empty list, and the size of `ldb` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. The code snippet prints `elem` twice followed by a space. Since the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. However, we know that `elem` must be an element of the list `ldb`.

Output: **elem elem**
