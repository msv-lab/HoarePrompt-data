Output State: **`sz` is either 2 or 4, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the current element being processed is the next element in `rdb`.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2. Given that `sz` was initially either 0 or 2, adding 2 to it results in `sz` being either 2 (if it was initially 0) or 4 (if it was initially 2). The conditions regarding `rdb` and the current element being processed remain unchanged.
