Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 1, but since the exact initial value of `sz` is not specified, we only know that `sz` is now `sz` + 1. The `break` statement does not change the value of `sng`, so `sng` must still have at least one element. We also note that the `break` statement indicates that we have exited the innermost loop or conditional statement.
