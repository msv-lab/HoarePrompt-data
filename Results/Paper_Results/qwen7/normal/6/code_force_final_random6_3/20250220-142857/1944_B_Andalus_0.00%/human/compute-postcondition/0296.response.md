Output State: **`sz` is `sz` + 1, `sng` must contain at least one element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional context was provided, we assume it is breaking out of a loop or conditional block. The initial conditions for `sz` and `sng` remain unchanged.
