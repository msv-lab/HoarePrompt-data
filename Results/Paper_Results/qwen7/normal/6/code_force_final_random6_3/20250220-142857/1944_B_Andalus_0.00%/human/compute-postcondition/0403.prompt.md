Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop continues executing as long as `sz` is less than `k`. After all iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` if `sz` was able to reach `k` during the loop's execution. If `sz` could not reach `k` because `k - sz` was less than 2 for all elements in `ldb`, then `sz` will remain the last value it reached which is less than `k`. The value of `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` as per the initial conditions.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` is a non-empty collection, the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` is a non-empty collection (excluding the first element from the previous iteration), the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is `sz + 1`; if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` is a non-empty collection, the first element of `sng` is `elem`, the size of `sng` (`sz`) is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
