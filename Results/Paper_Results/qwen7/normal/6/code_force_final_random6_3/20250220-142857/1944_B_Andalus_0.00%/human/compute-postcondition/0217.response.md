Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is the size of `ldb`.
- `k - sz` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 2, which means `k - sz` could be 2 or 1.

However, the specific value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined or described in the initial state, we cannot determine its value precisely.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

We know it will print `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **elem elem**
