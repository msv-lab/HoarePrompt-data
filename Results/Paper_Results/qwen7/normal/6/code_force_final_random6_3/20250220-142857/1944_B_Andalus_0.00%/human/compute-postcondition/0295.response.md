Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: `sz` is `sz` + 1
- **For Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for elem in sng:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `elem`: This variable is used to iterate over the elements in the list `sng`.
   - `sng`: This is the list being iterated over.

2. **State Adjustment**:
   - The state `sz` is updated by adding 1 at the end of the previous iteration. However, this update does not directly affect the loop itself.
   - The only variables that can be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are those mentioned in the loop head: `elem` and `sng`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the list `sng` must contain at least one element that has not yet been processed by the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is `sz` + 1.
- Since `sz` is updated by adding 1, it indicates that an element from the list `sng` has been processed.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element.

### Updated State:
- `sz` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `sng` must still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sz` is `sz` + 1, `sng` must contain at least one element**
