Based on the initial state provided:

- `elem` is the second element of `ldb`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

To determine the exact value of `elem`, we need to know the second element of `ldb`. Since this value is not explicitly given, we can only refer to it as the second element of `ldb`.

Output: **elem elem**
