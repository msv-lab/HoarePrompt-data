Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, and there are no specific requirements for the contents of `sng` as it is not mentioned in the provided loop and its conditions. `sz` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `sz` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `rdb`, or `sng` as described in the initial state. Therefore, `i` remains equal to `n`, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, and `sng` retains its original state containing all unique elements from `lft` that are not part of any consecutive duplicates. The value of `sz` is updated to 0.
