Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`. When the loop starts, `sng` is a non-empty collection excluding the first element from the previous iteration.

3. **Adjust the State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` is a non-empty collection, and `elem` is the first element of `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element.

4. **Consider the Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `sz` (which was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration) is greater than or equal to `k`. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't need to consider the break condition directly in our adjustment.

5. **Update the State**: Since `sng` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue, we can assume that `sng` is still non-empty. `elem` will be the first element of the updated `sng`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `sng` is a non-empty collection (since it must still contain at least one element).
- `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`sng` is a non-empty collection, the first element of `sng` is `elem`**.
