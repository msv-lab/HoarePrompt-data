Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `rdb`, `sz`, and `sng` remain unchanged from their initial states.
