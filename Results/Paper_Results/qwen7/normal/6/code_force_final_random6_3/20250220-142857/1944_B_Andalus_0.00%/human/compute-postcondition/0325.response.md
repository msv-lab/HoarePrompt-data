Output State: **`ldb` now contains the element `lft[i]`, `i` is `i_end + 1` and less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Since `i` is initially `i_end + 1` and less than `n`, after appending `lft[i]` to `ldb`, `i` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition `i_end + 1 < n`. The value of `n` remains the same as the initial state, and no other variables are affected.
