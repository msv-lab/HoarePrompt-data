Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Determine Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 1`.
   - For the loop to run successfully, `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Consider the Post-Loop States**:
   - The states of `ldb`, `sng`, `sz`, `rdb`, `sng`, `lft`, and `rgt` are mentioned to remain unchanged after the loop. This means these variables should not be modified within the loop head.
   - The loop body itself is omitted, but we need to ensure that the initial conditions allow the loop to run correctly without modifying these variables.

5. **Formulate the Required State**:
   - We need to ensure `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop.
   - We need to ensure `n` is at least `2` to allow the loop to run from `1` to `n-1`.

Given this analysis, the required state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
