Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is a list with at least one element. The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the `print` statement. Since no further information about `elem` is given, we can assume that `elem` refers to an element from the list `sng`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Since `elem` is an element from the list `sng` and `sng` has at least one element, `elem` will be one of those elements. However, without knowing the exact value of `elem`, we can only say that it is an element from the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is an element from the list sng)**
