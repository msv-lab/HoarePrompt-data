Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `ldb` and `sng` are modified as follows: if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` remains unchanged and `sng` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ldb` is updated with the element `lft[i]` appended to it, and `sng` remains unchanged if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` equals `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` remains unchanged.
