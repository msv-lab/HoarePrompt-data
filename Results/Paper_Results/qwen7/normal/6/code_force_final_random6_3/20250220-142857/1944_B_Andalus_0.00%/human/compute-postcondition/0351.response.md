Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n`, `n` remains unchanged, and `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented to `n` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`). The list `rdb` will have been populated with all elements from `rgt` that appear consecutively. This is because the loop appends `rgt[i]` to `rdb` whenever `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i-1]`, effectively collecting all consecutive duplicates into `rdb`. The values of `n`, `rdb`, `sng`, `lft`, and `rgt` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, as per the problem statement.
