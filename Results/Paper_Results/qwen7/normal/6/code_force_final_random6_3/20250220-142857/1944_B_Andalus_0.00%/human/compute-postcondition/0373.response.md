Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the list `ldb`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `ldb`.

3. **Determine the Postcondition**: After the loop, the size of `ldb` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. The value of `sz` changes based on the condition `k - sz >= 2`.

4. **Analyze the Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ldb` is a non-empty list, and its size remains unchanged. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `ldb`, the size of `ldb` does not change during the loop execution.
   - The value of `sz` might change if `k - sz >= 2` is true, but this change happens inside the loop body, not in the loop head.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is the list `ldb`, because the loop head specifies that the loop iterates over elements in `ldb`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ldb` remains a non-empty list with the same size as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`ldb` is a non-empty list with the same size as it was at the end of the previous iteration**.
