Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, and the length of `sng` (or `sz`) is equal to `k` + 1**.

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Given the initial condition that the length of `sng` is equal to `k`, after executing the code, the length of `sng` becomes `k + 1`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
