Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sz` is either 0 or 2.
   - `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for elem in rdb:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `rdb` is not empty.

4. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, it means there are still elements left to iterate over.
   - The loop will continue until all elements in `rdb` are processed.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `elem` (which changes with each iteration) and `rdb` (which remains unchanged as long as it is not empty).
   - Since `rdb` is non-empty, the loop can continue.

6. **Post-Iteration States:**
   - `sz` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop does not directly modify `sz`.
   - `rdb` remains a non-empty iterable, but since we are starting a new iteration, we consider the next element in `rdb`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `sz` remains either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` remains a non-empty iterable, but we consider the next element in `rdb`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the current element being processed is the next element in `rdb`.**
