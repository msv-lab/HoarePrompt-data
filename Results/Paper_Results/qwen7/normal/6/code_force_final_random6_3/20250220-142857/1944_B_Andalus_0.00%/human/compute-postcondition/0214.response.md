Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is the size of `ldb`, and `k - sz` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ldb`, `sz`, or `k - sz`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and the only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
