Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - If `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, then `ldb` has the element `lft[2]` appended to it.
   - If `i < n - 1` and `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`, then `sng` has an element appended which is `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating from `1` to `n-1`, and `i` is currently `2`, the next value of `i` would be `3`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - We need to check the conditions for the next iteration:
     - For `ldb`: The condition `lft[2] == lft[1]` is already checked in the previous iteration, so we don't need to change anything related to `ldb` unless there was a change in `lft[1]` or `lft[2]` during the loop body, but since no such information is given, we assume it remains the same.
     - For `sng`: The condition `i < n - 1` is true because `i` is `2` and `n > 1`, so we need to check if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`. If it is not equal, then `sng` will have an element appended which is `lft[2]`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is now `3`.
- `n` remains the same (an integer greater than 1).
- `ldb` remains unchanged based on the previous iteration's condition.
- `sng` will have an element appended which is `lft[2]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[3]`.

However, since the exact state of `ldb` and `sng` is not specified, we can only update `i` and `n`:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1**.
