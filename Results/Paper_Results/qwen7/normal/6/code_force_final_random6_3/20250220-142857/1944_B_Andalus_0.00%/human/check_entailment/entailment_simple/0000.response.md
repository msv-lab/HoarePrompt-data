Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `lst` which contains `2n` integers. This part is correct.

2. **Splitting the Array**: The array `lst` is split into `lft` and `rgt`, where `lft` contains the first `n` elements and `rgt` contains the last `n` elements. This is correct.

3. **Finding Duplicates and Single Elements**:
   - `ldb` is intended to store duplicates from `lft`.
   - `rdb` is intended to store duplicates from `rgt`.
   - `sng` is intended to store single elements from `lft`.

4. **Sorting and Processing**:
   - `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This helps in identifying duplicates.
   - The code then iterates through `lft` to identify duplicates and single elements, storing them in `ldb` and `sng` respectively.
   - Similarly, it processes `rgt` to identify duplicates and store them in `rdb`.

5. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The code attempts to construct the arrays `l` and `r` using the elements from `ldb` and `sng`. It tries to maximize the use of duplicates to ensure the XOR condition is met.
   - The logic for constructing `l` and `r` seems to prioritize using duplicates first, then single elements, ensuring that the XOR of `l` equals the XOR of `r`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `k` is small enough that it might not be possible to fully utilize duplicates, falling back to using single elements.
   - However, the code does not handle the case where `k` is odd, which could lead to issues since `l` and `r` need to have an even length.

7. **Output**:
   - The code prints the constructed arrays `l` and `r` for each test case.

Given the above points, the code generally follows the problem requirements, but there is a potential issue with handling odd values of `k`. The current implementation assumes `k` is even, which might not always be the case.

Correctness: **False**

The code needs to be adjusted to handle odd values of `k` properly, ensuring that both `l` and `r` have the correct length and satisfy the XOR condition.
