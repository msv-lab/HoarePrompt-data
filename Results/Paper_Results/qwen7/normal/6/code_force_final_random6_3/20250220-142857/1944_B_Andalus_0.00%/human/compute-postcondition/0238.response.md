Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The key variables here are `sng` and `elem`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `sng` has at least one element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sng` must have at least one element.
   - `sz` is `sz` + 1, meaning `sz` has been incremented by 1.
   - If the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is incremented by 1, `sz` is now `sz + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `sng` must still have at least one element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` still has at least one element and `sz` is `sz + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1**
