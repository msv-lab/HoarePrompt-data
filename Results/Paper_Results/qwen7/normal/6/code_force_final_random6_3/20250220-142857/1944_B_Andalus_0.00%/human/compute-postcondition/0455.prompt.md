Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        if k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` plus the length of the sequence `sng`. The loop breaks once `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`, so `sz` will be exactly `k` plus the number of elements in `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: All elements in `sng` have been printed, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng`, and `rdb` is an iterable containing all elements from `sng` that were printed during the loop. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks before processing all elements in `sng`.

This means that the loop will continue to print elements from `sng` until either `sz` (which starts at 0 and increments with each iteration) reaches the value of `k` or until all elements in `sng` have been processed. Once the loop exits, all elements that were printed are stored in `rdb`, and `sz` will be the total number of elements processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `sng` is a non-empty list, `ldb` remains unchanged, and `sz` is an even number that is the last even number less than or equal to `k`.

Explanation: According to the given conditions, the loop continues to increment `sz` by 2 until it reaches or exceeds `k`. After all iterations, `sz` will be the largest even number that is less than or equal to `k`. The value of `sng` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it within the loop. Similarly, `ldb` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
