Output State: **`sng` must have at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1, and if the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since `sng` must have at least one element and the condition for breaking the loop depends on the size of `sng` being greater than or equal to `k`, the updated value of `sz` is `sz` + 1. The other conditions remain unchanged.
