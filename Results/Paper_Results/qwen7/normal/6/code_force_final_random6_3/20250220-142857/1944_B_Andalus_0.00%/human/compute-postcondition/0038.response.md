Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 1`.
   - The value of `n` must be at least 2 (since the loop runs until `i < n`).

4. **Consider the post-loop conditions**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` should be equal to `n`.
   - `ldb` should contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `lft` starting from the second element.
   - `sng` should contain all unique elements from `lft` that are not part of any consecutive duplicates.

5. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i < n`, `n` must be at least 2.
   - The values of `ldb` and `sng` are determined by the loop body and are not directly set in the initial state.

Given these considerations, the only variables that need to be adjusted in the initial state are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
