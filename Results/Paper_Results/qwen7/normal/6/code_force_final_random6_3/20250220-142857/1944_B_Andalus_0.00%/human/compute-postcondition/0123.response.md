Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sz` is either 2 or 4.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether the condition `sz >= k` is true or false.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for elem in rdb:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `elem`:**
   - This variable is used in the loop but is not mentioned in the postcondition. Therefore, it does not affect the loop continuation.
   
2. **Variable `rdb`:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`. After each iteration, `rdb` loses one element.
   - Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before, this means that `rdb` has lost one element from its previous state.

3. **Variable `sz`:**
   - The value of `sz` is either 2 or 4.
   - The loop does not directly modify `sz`, but the loop continues based on the size of `rdb`.
   - Given that `rdb` has lost one element, the size of `rdb` (and thus `sz`) might change, but the postcondition specifies that `sz` remains either 2 or 4.

4. **Condition for Loop Continuation:**
   - The loop continues as long as `rdb` is not empty.
   - Since `rdb` has lost one element, it still contains at least one element (it was non-empty and now has one fewer element).

### Adjusting the States
- The only variable that changes due to the loop is `rdb`, which loses one element.
- `sz` remains either 2 or 4 as per the postcondition.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `sz` is either 2 or 4.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before (i.e., it has lost one element).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`sz` is either 2 or 4, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before.**
