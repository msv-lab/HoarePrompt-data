Output State: **`ldb` contains at least one element, `sz` is the size of `ldb` plus 2, and `k - sz` is either greater than or equal to 0 or less than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2. Since `sz` was initially the size of `ldb`, after the increment, `sz` becomes the size of `ldb` plus 2. The condition involving `k` and `sz` remains unchanged, so `k - sz` is either greater than or equal to 0 or less than 0, depending on the initial values of `k` and `sz`.
