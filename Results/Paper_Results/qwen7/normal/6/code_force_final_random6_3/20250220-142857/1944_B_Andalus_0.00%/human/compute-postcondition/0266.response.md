Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the current element being processed is the next element in `rdb`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `sz` or `rdb`, nor does it affect the current element being processed in `rdb`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it was in.
