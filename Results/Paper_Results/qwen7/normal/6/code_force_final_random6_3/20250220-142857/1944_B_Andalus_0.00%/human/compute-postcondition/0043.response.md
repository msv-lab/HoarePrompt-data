Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`.
   - If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i < n`, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 (since the loop condition depends on `n` being greater than `i`).
   - `rdb` will contain the value of `rgt[0]` unless `rgt[1]` is equal to `rgt[0]`, in which case `rdb` remains unchanged. However, since we don't know the value of `rgt[1]` or if it equals `rgt[0]`, we assume `rdb` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`**.
