State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `elem` and `rdb`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
3. Since `sz` (which could represent the size or length of `rdb`) is currently 0, it means `rdb` is empty.
4. For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `rdb` is a non-empty iterable.
