Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 2.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether the condition `sz >= k` is true or false.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since the print statement is printing `elem` twice, and there's no other context to determine the value of `elem`, we need to consider the most likely scenario based on typical programming practices.

Given that `rdb` is a non-empty iterable and the program breaks out of the loop, it suggests that `elem` might be the last element of `rdb` before the iterable was modified (since `rdb` now has one fewer element).

Therefore, `elem` is likely the last element of the original `rdb`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the last element of the original rdb)**
