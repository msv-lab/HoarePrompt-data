Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty list, `ldb` remains unchanged, and `sz` is equal to the original size of `sng` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since `sng` is a non-empty list and `ldb` remains unchanged, these conditions are still valid. The only change is that `sz` is now one more than its original value.
