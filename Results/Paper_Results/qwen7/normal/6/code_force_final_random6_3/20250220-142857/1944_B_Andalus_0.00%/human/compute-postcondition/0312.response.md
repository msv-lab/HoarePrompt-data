Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted slice of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, `rgt` is a slice of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from the `n+1` index, `rgt` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt`. The other variables (`ldb`, `sz`, `rdb`, `sng`, `lft`) remain unchanged. `rgt` now contains the elements of the original `lst` from index `n+1` onwards and is sorted.
