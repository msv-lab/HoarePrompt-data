Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty list.
- `ldb` remains unchanged.
- `sz` is equal to the original size of `sng` minus 1.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

Since the value of `elem` is not explicitly given in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `elem` must be one of the elements in the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is one of the elements in the list sng)**
