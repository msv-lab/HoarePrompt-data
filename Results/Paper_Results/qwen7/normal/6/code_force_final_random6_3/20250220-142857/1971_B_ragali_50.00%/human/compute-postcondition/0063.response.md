Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `i` is the first character of the stripped string `s.strip()`. Since `s` is non-empty, `s.strip()` will also be non-empty, and `i` will be the first character of this stripped string.
- `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s.strip()`, and the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1. This means that `s.strip()` contains only one unique character.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
