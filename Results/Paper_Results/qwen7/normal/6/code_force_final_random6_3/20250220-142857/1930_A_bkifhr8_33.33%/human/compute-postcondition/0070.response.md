Output State: **`i` is (n * 2) + 1, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is 0, and `lst` is empty or contains fewer elements than it did initially, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `ans`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
