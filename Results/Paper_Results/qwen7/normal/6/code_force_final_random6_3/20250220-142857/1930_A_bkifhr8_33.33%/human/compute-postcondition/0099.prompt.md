Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is (n * 2) + 1, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is within the range 0 to n * 2, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2 (which was previously `lst[1 * 2]`). If the length of `lst` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` does not contain the element at index 2, and we either remove the second element from `lst` or break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the current value of `i` + 1, `t` remains the same, `ans` is `ans` plus the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst`, and `lst` does not contain the element at index 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
