Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.
   - Either the length of `lst` is not equal to 2 or `lst` has been modified to remove the element at index 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `i < n * 2`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - The modifications to `ans` and `lst` do not affect the loop continuation condition directly, but they may change the values of `ans` and `lst` inside the loop body.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (since `i` was less than or equal to `n * 2`).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` and `lst` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and either the length of `lst` is not equal to 2 or `lst` has been modified to remove the element at index 2. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1.** 

To summarize the final state:

State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and either the length of `lst` is not equal to 2 or `lst` has been modified to remove the element at index 2.**
