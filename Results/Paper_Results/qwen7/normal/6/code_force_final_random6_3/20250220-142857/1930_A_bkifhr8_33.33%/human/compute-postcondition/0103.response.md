Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized from the `ans_f` list.
   - `ans_f`: This is the list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ans_f`**: Since `ans_f` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, and `t` remains the same after all iterations, we need to know the initial state of `ans_f`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in `ans_f`. Each element in `ans_f` represents the cumulative sum of `ans` up to that point. The loop body processes each element in `ans_f`, but the state of `t` and `lst` is not relevant in the final output state as described.

4. **Final State Requirements**:
   - `t` remains the same as it was initially.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration.
   - `lst` is an empty list since all elements have been processed according to the conditions inside the loop.
   - `i` is no longer used in the final state but was incremented in each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should reflect the necessary conditions for the loop to execute properly and produce the specified final state.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration, `lst` is an empty list, `i` is not relevant in the final state but was incremented in each iteration.**

This ensures that the loop can execute and produce the required final state.
