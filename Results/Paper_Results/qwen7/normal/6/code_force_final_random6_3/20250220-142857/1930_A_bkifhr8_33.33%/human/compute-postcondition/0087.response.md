Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` is the same as before, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list with the second element (index 1) removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index 1 from the list `lst`. Since the initial state mentions that `lst` is a list with the first element removed, after removing the second element, the list remains a list with two elements less the first one. The values of `i`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
