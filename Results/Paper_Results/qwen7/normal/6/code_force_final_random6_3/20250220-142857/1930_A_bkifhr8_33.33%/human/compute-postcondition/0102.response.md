Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains the same as it was initially (an integer between 1 and 5000), `ans_f` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration of the loop, and `lst` is an empty list since all elements have been processed according to the conditions inside the loop. The variable `i` is no longer used in the final state but was incremented in each iteration of the loop. The state of `n` is not relevant in the final output state as it is an input for each iteration and gets replaced with new values in each iteration.
