Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `ans_f` is a non-empty list containing the cumulative sum of `ans` for each iteration.
- `lst` is an empty list.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(i)
```

However, there is no variable `i` defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, it is impossible to determine its value from the given information. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific value for what will be printed.

Output: **i (where i is an undefined variable)**
