Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is 0, `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`, and `n` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans_f`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
