Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n * 2)` statement. The only variable directly involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`
   - `ans_f` is an empty list
   - Either the element at index 0 in `lst` is removed or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n * 2`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `ans` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans_f` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - The condition for the element at index 0 in `lst` being removed or breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `ans_f` is an empty list, and either the element at index 0 in `lst` is removed or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
