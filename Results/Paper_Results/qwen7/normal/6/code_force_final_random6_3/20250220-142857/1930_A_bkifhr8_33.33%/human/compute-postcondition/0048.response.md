Postcondition: `i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. Additionally, if the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` does not contain its first element at index 0, and `lst` has been modified to remove the element at index 2. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.
