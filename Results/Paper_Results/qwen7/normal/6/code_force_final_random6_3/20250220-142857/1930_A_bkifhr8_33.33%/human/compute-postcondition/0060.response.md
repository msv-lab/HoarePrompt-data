Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the first element of `lst` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is index 0) from the list `lst`. This means the first element of `lst` is removed. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
