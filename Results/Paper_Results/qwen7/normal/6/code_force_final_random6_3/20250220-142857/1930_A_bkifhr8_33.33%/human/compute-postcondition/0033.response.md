Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n * 2`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, `ans_f` is an empty list, and `n` is the input integer.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` equals `n * 2`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from the list `lst`, continuing until the list `lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining. The variable `t` remains greater than 0 as it was not affected by the loop. `ans_f` remains an empty list as it was not modified within the loop.
