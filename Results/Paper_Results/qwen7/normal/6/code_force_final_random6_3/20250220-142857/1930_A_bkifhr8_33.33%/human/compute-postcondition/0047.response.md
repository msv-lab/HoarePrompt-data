Output State: **`i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, and `lst` remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
