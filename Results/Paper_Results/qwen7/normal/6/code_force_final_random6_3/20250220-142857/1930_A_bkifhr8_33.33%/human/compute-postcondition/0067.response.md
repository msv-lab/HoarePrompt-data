Output State: **`i` will be equal to `n * 2`, `ans_f` will contain the latest value of `ans`, and `lst` will be empty or contain fewer elements than it did initially.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. This does not change the values of `i` or `lst`, but it adds the current value of `ans` to `ans_f`. Therefore, the output state includes these changes.
