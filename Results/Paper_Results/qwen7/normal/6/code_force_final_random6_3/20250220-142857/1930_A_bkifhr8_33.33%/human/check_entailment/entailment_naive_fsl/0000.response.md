Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. Specifically, the program does not sort the list before performing the operations, which is crucial to ensure that the minimum values are always chosen efficiently. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The correct approach would be to sort the list and pair the smallest elements first to maximize the score. However, the current implementation does not sort the list, leading to suboptimal results. For the given input, the correct output should be `3`, but the program might produce a lower score because it does not guarantee that the smallest elements are paired first.

To fix this, the program should sort the list before performing the operations.
