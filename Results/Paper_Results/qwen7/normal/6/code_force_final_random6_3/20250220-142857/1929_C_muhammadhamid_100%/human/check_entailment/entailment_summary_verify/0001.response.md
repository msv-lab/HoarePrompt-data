### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha needs to ensure he can win any number of coins, given the constraints on the bet multiplier `k`, the maximum number of consecutive losses `x`, and his initial number of coins `a`.
   - The program should check if Sasha can achieve this goal based on the given parameters.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input.
   - It calculates a value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha would need after `x` rounds of betting to ensure he can continue betting and eventually win any number of coins.
   - The formula used to calculate `s` is:
     ```python
     s = 1
     for i in range(x):
         s += s // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
   - This formula seems to be intended to simulate Sasha's betting strategy over `x` rounds, where he increases his bet size based on the previous round's outcome.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the loop is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row.
   - The calculation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is meant to represent the cumulative effect of losing `x` times in a row and then betting optimally to recover.
   - The final check `if a >= s` determines if Sasha can start with `a` coins and still be able to follow this strategy.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in the program appears to correctly simulate the worst-case scenario for Sasha's betting strategy.
   - However, the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is flawed. Let's analyze why:
     - When Sasha loses `x` times in a row, his bet size increases exponentially. The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately model this exponential growth.
     - Specifically, if Sasha loses `x` times in a row, the bet size after each loss is multiplied by `k - 1`. The correct way to simulate this would be to use a geometric progression, where the bet size after each loss is `(k - 1)` times the previous bet size.
     - The correct formula should be:
       ```python
       s = 1
       for i in range(x):
           s *= k - 1
       ```

5. **Validation Using Test Cases:**
   - Let's validate the original assessment using the provided test cases:
     - For the first test case (`2 1 7`):
       - Correct formula: `s = 1 * (2 - 1) = 1`
       - Incorrect formula: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
       - The program incorrectly prints 'Yes' instead of 'No'.
     - For the second test case (`2 1 1`):
       - Correct formula: `s = 1 * (2 - 1) = 1`
       - Incorrect formula: `s = 1 + 1 = 2`
       - The program incorrectly prints 'Yes' instead of 'No'.
     - For the third test case (`2 3 15`):
       - Correct formula: `s = 1 * (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 1`
       - Incorrect formula: `s = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
       - The program incorrectly prints 'Yes' instead of 'No'.

Given the analysis, the program's logic is incorrect due to the flawed formula used to simulate the worst-case scenario. The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly determine if Sasha can achieve his goal.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
