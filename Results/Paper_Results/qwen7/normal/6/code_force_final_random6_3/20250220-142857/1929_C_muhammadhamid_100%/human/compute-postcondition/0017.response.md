Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1.
- `x` must still be greater than 0.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0**
