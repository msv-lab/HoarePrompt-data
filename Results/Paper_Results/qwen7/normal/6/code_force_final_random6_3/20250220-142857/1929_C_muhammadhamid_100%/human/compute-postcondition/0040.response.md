Functionality: **The function processes multiple inputs where each input consists of integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each set of inputs, it calculates the value of `s` starting from 1 and updating it `x` times using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After these calculations, it compares `a` with `s` and prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input set.**
