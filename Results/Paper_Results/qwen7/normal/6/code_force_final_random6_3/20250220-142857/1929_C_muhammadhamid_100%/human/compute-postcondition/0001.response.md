Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is set to the first integer input, `x` is set to the second integer input, `a` is set to the third integer input, and the input value must be a non-negative integer.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The values of `t` and the condition constraints remain unchanged.
