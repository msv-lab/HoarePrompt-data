Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `s` or `k`. Since no specific values for `s` and `k` are given, the updated value of `s` remains in the form of `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
