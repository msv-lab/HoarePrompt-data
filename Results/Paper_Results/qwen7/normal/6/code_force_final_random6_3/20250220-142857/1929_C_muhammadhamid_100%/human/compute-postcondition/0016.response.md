Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is `s // (k - 1) + 1`**

The code updates the value of `s` by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `s` or `k`, the updated value of `s` is expressed as `s // (k - 1) + 1`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
