Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `x - 1`, meaning `i` is one less than `x`.
- `x` must be greater than 0, so the loop will run at least once.
- `s` is the result of repeatedly applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` starting from `s = 1` a total of `x` times.

The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints either "Yes" or "No" accordingly. Since the value of `a` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will depend on the comparison between `a` and `s`.

Given the information, the output will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on the value of `a` relative to `s`.

Output: **Yes** if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise **No**.
