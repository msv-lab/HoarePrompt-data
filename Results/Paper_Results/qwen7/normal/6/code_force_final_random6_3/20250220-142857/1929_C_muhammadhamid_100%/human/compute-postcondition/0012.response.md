Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the initial state**: We know that the loop will execute `x` times, where `x` is the integer input. After `x` iterations, `i` will be equal to `x-1`.

3. **Understand the loop body behavior**: The problem statement mentions that each iteration of the loop doubles the previous value of `s` and then subtracts 1. Starting from `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 1, after the second iteration, `s` becomes 3, and so on. Therefore, after `x` iterations, `s` will be \(2^x - 1\).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations (`x`) must increase by 1. This means the new value of `x` will be the current value of `x` plus 1.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is equal to `x-1`.
- `s` is equal to \(2^{x-1} - 1\).
- `x` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be updated to `x`.
- `s` will be updated to \(2^x - 1\).
- `x` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is now `x`.
- `s` is now \(2^x - 1\).
- `x` is now `x + 1`.

Since the loop head only involves `x`, we need to adjust the state of `x` for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `x`, `s` is \(2^x - 1\), `x` is `x + 1`**
