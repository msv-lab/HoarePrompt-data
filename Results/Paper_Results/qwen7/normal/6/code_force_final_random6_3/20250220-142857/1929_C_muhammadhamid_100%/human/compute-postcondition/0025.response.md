Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`. However, since we are not given the exact input value, we will denote it as `x`.

2. **Determine the State After Each Iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, inclusive, after `x-1` iterations, `i` will be `x - 1`.
   - The variable `x` must remain greater than 0 as it is a condition for the loop to continue executing. Since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, `x` must still be greater than 0.
   - The variable `s` undergoes the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` in each iteration. Starting from `s = 1`, after `x` iterations, `s` will be the final value obtained.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 from `x - 1` to `x`.
   - The variable `x` must still be greater than 0.
   - The variable `s` will undergo the operation one more time, meaning it will be updated based on its current value plus the result of the operation `s // (k - 1) + 1`.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is `x`, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times starting from `s = 1`**.
