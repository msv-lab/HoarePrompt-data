You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

    YES

    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `x` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `x-1`. After all iterations, `s` will be \(2^x - 1\), `k` will remain as the input integer, `x` will remain as the input integer, and `i` will be equal to `x-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `s` will undergo the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times, starting from `s = 1`. This results in `s` being transformed into \(2^x - 1\). The variable `i` will increment from 0 up to `x-1` during the loop, and thus will be equal to `x-1` after the loop completes. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple inputs where each input consists of integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. For each set of inputs, it calculates the value of `s` starting from 1 and updating it `x` times using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After these calculations, it compares `a` with `s` and prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input set.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `s` based on the number of consecutive losses `x`, but it does not account for the varying bet amounts based on wins and losses as per the problem description. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 1 1`
- Expected Output: `NO`

Here’s why the program fails:
- For `k=2`, `x=1`, and `a=1`, Sasha starts with 1 coin.
- According to the problem, Sasha can only place 1 coin initially because he cannot lose more than 1 time in a row.
- If he loses, he cannot place any more bets since he would have no coins left.
- Therefore, Sasha cannot guarantee having more than 1 coin, which contradicts the expected output of `NO`.

The program incorrectly assumes that Sasha can always increase his bet amount, which is not the case according to the problem description. Hence, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
