Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will execute `x` times. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `x-1`, `x` remains unchanged, `s` will be \(2^{x} - 1\).

This is because each iteration of the loop doubles the previous value of `s` and then subtracts 1. Starting from `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 1, after the second iteration, `s` becomes 3 (which is \(2 \times 1 + 1\)), and so on. Therefore, after `x` iterations, `s` will be \(2^x - 1\).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `x - 1`, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x` times starting from `s = 1`.

To explain this output state in more detail:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`, inclusive.
- The variable `x` must remain greater than 0 as it is a condition for the loop to continue executing.
- The variable `s` will be the final value obtained after performing the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times, starting with `s = 1`. This means `s` will go through the transformation defined by the loop body `x` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The value of `s` will be 8, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 5.

Explanation: From the given information, we can observe that the value of `s` increases by 2 with each iteration of the loop. Starting from `s = 1` (initial state), after the first iteration, `s` becomes 2, after the second iteration, `s` becomes 4, and after the third iteration, `s` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration, `s` will be 8. The variable `i` increments by 1 with each iteration, so after 4 iterations, `i` will be 4. However, since the loop uses `range(x)`, `i` will be 5 when the loop finishes because it stops after the last index, which is `x-1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
