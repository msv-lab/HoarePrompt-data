Output State: The final value of `t` after the loop has executed all its iterations will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration. After the loop completes, `t` will be updated based on the conditions provided within the loop body. Specifically, `t` is initially set to `b * 2`, then adjusted according to the following rules:

1. If `t % 5 == 0`, `t` is set to `t // 5`.
2. Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`.
3. Then, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
4. If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
5. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
6. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
7. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

After all iterations, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of these updates based on the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop. The exact value of `t` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of applying the above logic iteratively for `n` times.
