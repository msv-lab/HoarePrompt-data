The code `t = b * 2` simply updates the value of `t` to be twice the value of `b`. Given the initial conditions, `t` was previously defined as `b * 2`, so updating `t` to be `b * 2` does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2`, and `b` is now an integer.**
