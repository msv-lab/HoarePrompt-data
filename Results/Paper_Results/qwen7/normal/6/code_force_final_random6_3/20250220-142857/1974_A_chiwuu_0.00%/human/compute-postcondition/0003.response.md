Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is a string from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer and assigns it back to `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged.
