Output State: **`t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, and `t` is adjusted based on whether it is divisible by 5 or not, and `t1` is less than `a`.**

Explanation: The code `t2 = a - t1` assigns the value of `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)` to `t2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `t1` is less than `a` also remains valid.
