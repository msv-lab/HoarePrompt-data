### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Program Analysis:
The given program attempts to calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   ```python
   t = b * 2
   ```
   This sets `t` to twice the number of 2x2 icons, which is a reasonable starting point since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

2. **Adjustment Based on Divisibility by 5**:
   ```python
   if t % 5 == 0:
       t = t // 5
   else:
       t = t // 5 + 1
   ```
   This adjustment seems to be unnecessary and incorrect. The logic here is flawed because it doesn't account for the actual space available on the screens.

3. **Calculation of `t1`**:
   ```python
   t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
   ```
   This calculation is supposed to determine the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons, but it is not used correctly in the subsequent logic.

4. **Handling Remaining Icons**:
   ```python
   if t1 >= a:
       t = t
   else:
       t2 = a - t1
       if t2 % 15 == 0:
           t = t + t2 // 15
       else:
           t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
   ```
   This part of the logic is also incorrect. The variable `t1` is not used effectively, and the handling of remaining icons is not optimal.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed, we should follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Full 2x2 Screens**:
   ```python
   full_screens = b
   ```

2. **Calculate Remaining Space After Placing Full 2x2 Screens**:
   ```python
   remaining_space = 15 - (b * 4)
   ```

3. **Distribute Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   ```python
   remaining_icons = a % 15
   additional_screens = (a // 15) + (1 if remaining_icons > 0 else 0)
   ```

4. **Total Screens Needed**:
   ```python
   total_screens = full_screens + additional_screens
   ```

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        full_screens = b
        remaining_space = 15 - (b * 4)
        remaining_icons = a % 15
        additional_screens = (a // 15) + (1 if remaining_icons > 0 else 0)
        total_screens = full_screens + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. The logic provided in the original assessment is correct, and the corrected program provided above fixes the issues.

**Final: False**
