You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` after the loop has executed all its iterations will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration. After the loop completes, `t` will be updated based on the conditions provided within the loop body. Specifically, `t` is initially set to `b * 2`, then adjusted according to the following rules:
    #
    #1. If `t % 5 == 0`, `t` is set to `t // 5`.
    #2. Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`.
    #3. Then, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
    #4. If `t1 >= a`, `t` remains unchanged.
    #5. Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
    #6. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
    #7. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
    #
    #After all iterations, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of these updates based on the inputs provided for each iteration of the loop. The exact value of `t` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration, but it will be the result of applying the above logic iteratively for `n` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t1` and `t2` is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2`

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. `t = b * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
2. `t % 5 == 0`, so `t = t // 5 = 8 // 5 = 1`
3. `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 1 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 15 - 16 = -1`
4. Since `t1 < 0`, it should not affect the calculation of `t`.

But the program incorrectly handles this case. It should consider the remaining icons (`a - t1`) and distribute them across additional screens. The correct approach would be to ensure that the remaining icons are distributed optimally across the screens.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the number of full 2x2 screens needed.
2. Distributing the remaining 1x1 icons optimally across the screens.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of full 2x2 screens needed
        full_screens = b
        # Remaining space after placing full 2x2 screens
        remaining_space = 15 - (b * 4)
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        remaining_icons = a % 15
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining icons
        additional_screens = (a // 15) + (1 if remaining_icons > 0 else 0)
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = full_screens + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected logic ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons.
