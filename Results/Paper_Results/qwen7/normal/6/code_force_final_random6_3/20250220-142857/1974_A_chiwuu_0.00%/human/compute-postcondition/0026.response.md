Output State: **`t2` is `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, and `t` is adjusted by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to its current value, and `t1` is less than `a`, and `t2` is not divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to its current value. Since `t2` is defined as `a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`, the value of `t` affects `t2`. However, the specific value of `t` after the operation is not given, so we keep it in terms of the operation performed. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
