Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer and assigns it back to `b`. The other variables (`t1`, `i`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged.
