To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t1` is defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split.
   - `t` is defined as:
     - `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`.
     - `b * 2 + 1` otherwise.

2. **Operations:**
   - If `t1 >= a`, then `t1` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

Given these steps, let's analyze the possible values of `t`:

- First, we need to determine the value of `t` based on the value of `b`.
- Then, we need to check the condition `t1 >= a` to decide how `t` changes.

Let's assume specific values for `a` and `b` to illustrate the process. For simplicity, let's assume `a = 10` and `b = 5`.

1. **Calculate `t`:**
   - Since `b = 5`, `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5` because `5 % 5 == 0`.
   - Therefore, `t = 5 * 2 // 5 = 2`.

2. **Calculate `t1`:**
   - We need the values of `t` and `b` to calculate `t1`.
   - Let's assume `t = 2` and `b = 5` (these are the values derived from the above calculation).
   - So, `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 2 * 15 - 5 * 4 = 30 - 20 = 10`.

3. **Check the condition `t1 >= a`:**
   - Here, `t1 = 10` and `a = 10`.
   - Since `t1 >= a`, `t1` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the final value of `t`:**
   - Since `t1` remains unchanged, there is no change in `t` based on the conditions provided.

Therefore, the value of `t` remains `2`.

Output: **2**
