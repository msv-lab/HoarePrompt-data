Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. Since `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` remains unchanged (still 1), `n` remains unchanged (greater than or equal to 1), `a` remains unchanged (an integer value converted from the first word of the input split), `b` remains unchanged (the second word from the input split converted to an integer), and `t` remains unchanged (either `b * 2` or adjusted according to the condition `t % 5 == 0`). Therefore, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
