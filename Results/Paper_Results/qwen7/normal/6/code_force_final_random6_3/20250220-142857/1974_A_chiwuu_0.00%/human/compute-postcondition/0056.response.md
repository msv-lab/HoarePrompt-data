Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 // 5`, and `b` is now an integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t // 5`. The other variables remain unchanged. The expression for `t1` remains the same as it was not affected by the code.
