Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `b * 2 + 1`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + t2 // 15`**.

Explanation: 
- The initial state includes the values of `t1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, and `t2`.
- The code updates the value of `t` by adding `t2 // 15` to its current value.
- The updated value of `t` is now `t + t2 // 15`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
