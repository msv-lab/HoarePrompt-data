Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, `t` is `t // 5`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by performing an integer division by 5 (`t = t // 5`). The other variables (`t1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and the expression for `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
