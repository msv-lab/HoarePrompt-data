Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which is greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be updated to 2.
   - `n` should remain as it was, which is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer value converted from the first word of the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split converted to an integer, `t` is `b * 2`, and `t` is updated as follows: if `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `a - t1 % 15 != 0`, or `t + (a - t1) // 15` if `a - t1 % 15 == 0`.**
