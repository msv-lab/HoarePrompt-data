Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `b * 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` updates the value of `t1` based on the current values of `t` and `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and the conditional value of `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
