Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the first word from the input split, and `b` is the second word from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`. The values of `t1`, `i`, `n`, and the original input conditions remain unchanged.
