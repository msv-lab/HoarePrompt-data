Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating `t1` and `t2` is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2`

However, the program calculates the number of screens as follows:
1. `t = b * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
2. `t % 5 == 0`, so `t = t // 5 = 8 // 5 = 1`
3. `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 = 1 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 15 - 16 = -1`
4. Since `t1 < 0`, it should not affect the calculation of `t`.

But the program incorrectly handles this case. It should consider the remaining icons (`a - t1`) and distribute them across additional screens. The correct approach would be to ensure that the remaining icons are distributed optimally across the screens.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the number of full 2x2 screens needed.
2. Distributing the remaining 1x1 icons optimally across the screens.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of full 2x2 screens needed
        full_screens = b
        # Remaining space after placing full 2x2 screens
        remaining_space = 15 - (b * 4)
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        remaining_icons = a % 15
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining icons
        additional_screens = (a // 15) + (1 if remaining_icons > 0 else 0)
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = full_screens + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected logic ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons.
