Postcondition: `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `b * 2 + 1`, `t2` is `a - t1`. If `t2 % 15 == 0`, then `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
