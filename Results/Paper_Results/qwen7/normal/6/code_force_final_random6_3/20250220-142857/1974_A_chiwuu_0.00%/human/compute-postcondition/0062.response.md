Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `b * 2 + 1`, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. The values of `t1`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. `t2` is now assigned the value of `a - t1`.
