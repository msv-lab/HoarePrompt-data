Output State: **`t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word of the input split, `b` is the integer value of the second word of the input split, `t` is `b * 2 // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `b * 2 + 1`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to its current value. Since `t2` is defined as `a - t1`, and `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, the value of `t` is adjusted accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
