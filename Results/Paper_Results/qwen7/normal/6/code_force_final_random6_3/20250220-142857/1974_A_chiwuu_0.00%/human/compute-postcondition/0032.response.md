Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `a` is an integer from the first input split
   - `b` is an integer from the second input split
   - `t1` is less than `a`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs for `i` in the range of `n`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, and `b` is an integer from the second input split.**
