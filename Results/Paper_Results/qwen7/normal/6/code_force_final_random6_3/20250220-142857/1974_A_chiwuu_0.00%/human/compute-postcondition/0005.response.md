Output State: **`t` is equal to `b` * 2, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split**.

The value of `t` is updated to `b * 2`, while the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `n`, `a`, and `b` stay the same as the initial state.
