Output State: **`t` is equal to `b` * 2 // 5 + 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, and `t` is not divisible by 5**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to `t // 5 + 1`. Given that `t` was initially equal to `b * 2`, the new value of `t` is now `b * 2 // 5 + 1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition that `t` is not divisible by 5 remains valid.
