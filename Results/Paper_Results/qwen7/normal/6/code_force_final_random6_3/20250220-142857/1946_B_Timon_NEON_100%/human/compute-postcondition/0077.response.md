Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `segments_variants` must contain at least one element.
- The postcondition is that if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and `len(segment) != 1`, then `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over each `segment` in `segments_variants`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `segments_variants` must contain at least one element.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each `segment` in `segments_variants`, the condition `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and `len(segment) != 1` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `total_max_segment` is updated to `segment`.
   - If the condition is false, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.

### Adjusting States
- **`segments_variants`**: Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, we need to consider the next `segment` in the list. Therefore, `segments_variants` should still contain at least one element, but it might be reduced in size if a segment was added to `total_max_segment`.
- **`total_max_segment`**: This variable could either remain unchanged or be updated to a new `segment`. However, since we are starting a new iteration, the exact value of `total_max_segment` is not relevant for the next iteration. We only need to ensure that `segments_variants` contains at least one element.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must still contain at least one element. The exact value of `total_max_segment` does not affect the next iteration as long as `segments_variants` is non-empty.

### Final State
State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one element**.
