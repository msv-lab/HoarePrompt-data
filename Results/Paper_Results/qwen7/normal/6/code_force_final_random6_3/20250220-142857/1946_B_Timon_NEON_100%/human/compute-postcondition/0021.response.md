Postcondition: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is a non-empty list with its elements updated according to the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` or to a segment ending at `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains `-1`. Specifically, if `arr[i] < 0`, then `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or to `new_segment` if not, and `max_sum` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `new_segment` is updated to include the current value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[i], arr[i]]`, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.
