Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['max_segment + [i - 1]'], `new_segment` is a non-empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `len(arr)` is at least 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0, the first element of `max_segment` is greater than the first element of `new_segment`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new segment to the `segments_variants` list. This new segment is formed by adding the index `i - 1` to the `max_segment` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
