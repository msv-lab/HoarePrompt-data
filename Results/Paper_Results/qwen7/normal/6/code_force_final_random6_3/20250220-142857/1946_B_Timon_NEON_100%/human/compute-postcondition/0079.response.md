Postcondition: `segments_variants` must contain at least one element. If `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1, then `total_max_segment` is updated to be equal to `segment`. If the condition `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` and the length of `segment` is not 1 is not met, then `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.
