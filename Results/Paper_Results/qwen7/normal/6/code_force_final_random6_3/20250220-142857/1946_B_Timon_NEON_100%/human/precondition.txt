t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and an array a of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function mod(number) returns the remainder of the number modulo 10^9 + 7.
