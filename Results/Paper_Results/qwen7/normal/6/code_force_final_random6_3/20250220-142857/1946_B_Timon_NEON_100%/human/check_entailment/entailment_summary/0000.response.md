Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The operations can be performed on any subarray, including the empty subarray, which contributes a sum of zero.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Maximum Segment Sum**: The function `func_2` aims to find the subarray with the maximum sum, excluding the case of a single-element subarray (since we need at least two elements). This is crucial because the maximum segment sum can be used to determine how much additional value can be added through the operations.
   - **Sum Calculation**: The main logic in the code calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`. Here, `max_segment[0]` is the maximum sum of a segment with at least two elements, and `2 ** k` represents the number of times this segment can be inserted back into the array.
   - **Modulo Operation**: The function `func_1` ensures that the result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Verification**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the modulo operation, which is essential for handling large sums.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies the subarray with the maximum sum that includes at least two elements. This is used to calculate the potential increase in the array's sum after `k` operations.
   - **Main Logic**: The main logic correctly applies the formula to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, taking into account the initial sum of the array and the additional sum contributed by the maximum segment repeated `2 ** k` times.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
