Postcondition: `segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains `-1`. Specifically, if `new_segment` is non-empty, `new_segment` is updated according to the value of `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` or to a segment ending at `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains unchanged. If `new_segment` is empty, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` or to `new_segment` if not, and `max_sum` remains unchanged.
