Postcondition: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if and else parts. If `arr[i] < 0`, `new_segment` becomes an empty list, and `max_segment` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `new_segment` is updated to contain the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i]`, and `max_segment` remains the best segment found so far. In both cases, `segments_variants` remains a list of segments, `max_sum` remains -1, and `max_segment` is updated based on the sum comparison.
