Output State: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i_end+1]`, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison with `max_segment[0]` increased by `arr[i]`, and `max_sum` remains -1. `new_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the first element of `new_segment` by adding `arr[i]` to it. The other variables remain in their previous states unless `new_segment` becomes non-empty, in which case it would be added to `segments_variants`. However, since the code only updates `new_segment[0]` and does not explicitly add `new_segment` to `segments_variants`, the state of `segments_variants` remains unchanged from the initial state.
