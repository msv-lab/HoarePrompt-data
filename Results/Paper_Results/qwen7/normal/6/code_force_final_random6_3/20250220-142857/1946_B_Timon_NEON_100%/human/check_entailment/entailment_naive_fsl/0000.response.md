Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the main requirement of performing k operations to maximize the sum of the array.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is not used in the context of solving the problem and does not contribute to the solution.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not account for the possibility of inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array multiple times. The logic inside the function is flawed and does not handle the insertion of sums into the array as required.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is incomplete and does not contain any logic to solve the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the array sum through the specified operations.

Given the problem description, the correct approach would involve:
- Iteratively selecting and inserting the sum of any subarray into the array.
- Keeping track of the current maximum sum achievable after each operation.
- Ensuring the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the provided code does not implement these steps, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
