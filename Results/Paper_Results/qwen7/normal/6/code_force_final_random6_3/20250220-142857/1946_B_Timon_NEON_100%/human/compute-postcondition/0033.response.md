Output State: **`segments_variants` is now a list containing the new_segment plus the element `i - 1`; `new_segment` remains either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index; `max_segment` is now `new_segment`; `max_sum` remains `-1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `new_segment` to `max_segment`. This means that `max_segment` now holds the value of `new_segment`, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
