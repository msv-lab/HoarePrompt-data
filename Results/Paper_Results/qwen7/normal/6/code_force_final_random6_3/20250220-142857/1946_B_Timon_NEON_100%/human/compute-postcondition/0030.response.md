Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `arr`, `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `segments_variants` is an empty list.
   - `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index.
   - `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison.
   - `max_sum` remains `-1`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body updates these variables based on the value of `arr[i]`. Specifically:
   - If `new_segment` is non-empty, it is updated according to the value of `arr[i]`.
   - `max_segment` is updated to either `[0, 0]` or to a segment ending at `i-1` based on the sum comparison.
   - `max_sum` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `new_segment` will be updated based on the value of `arr[i]`.
   - `max_segment` will be updated based on the sum comparison.
   - `max_sum` will remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `new_segment` will be updated based on the value of `arr[i]`.
- `max_segment` will be updated based on the sum comparison.
- `max_sum` will remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `new_segment` and `max_segment` depend on the loop body, we cannot specify them precisely without the loop body. However, we can say that `new_segment` will be either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index, and `max_segment` will be either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or a segment ending at some index `i-1` based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains `-1`.**
