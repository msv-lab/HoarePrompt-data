Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is either an empty list or [arr[i], i], `max_segment` is [arr[i], i], and `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation: The code updates `max_segment[0]` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. This means that `max_segment` now becomes `[arr[i], i]`. The other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
