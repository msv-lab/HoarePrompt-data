Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_sum` to -1. None of the other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, or `max_segment`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
