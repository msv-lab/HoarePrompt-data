Output State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one element; `total_max_segment` is equal to `segment`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. The value of `segments_variants` remains unchanged as it was mentioned to contain at least one element initially.
