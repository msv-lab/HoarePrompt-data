You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where -10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for each element arr[i].
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` is a list of all valid segments found during the execution of the loop, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration, and `max_sum` remains -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, `segments_variants` will contain all the segments that were considered as potential candidates for the maximum sum segment. The `new_segment` will be an empty list because it gets reset whenever a new segment is finalized and added to `segments_variants`. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum encountered during the entire process. Since the loop does not modify `max_sum` unless a new maximum is found, and no new maximum was found in the given conditions, `max_sum` remains -1.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0] and len(segment) != 1:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `segments_variants` contains all the segments generated during the iterations; `new_segment` remains an empty list; `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum found throughout all iterations; `max_sum` remains -1 (indicating no valid segment was found that meets the criteria); `total_max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `segments_variants` will include every segment variant generated during the process. The variable `new_segment` remains empty as it is only initialized and used within the loop but never assigned outside of it. `max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum encountered across all iterations. Since `max_sum` is initialized to -1 and only updated when a segment's sum exceeds the current `max_sum` and the segment has more than one element, `max_sum` will either remain -1 or be the sum of the `max_segment`. `total_max_segment` will be the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element, reflecting the best possible segment found according to the given condition.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns `total_max_segment`, which is the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. Each element in the list satisfies -10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9. The function returns the segment (subarray) with the highest sum among those that contain more than one element.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `total_max_segment`, which is the segment with the highest sum among those that have more than one element.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
