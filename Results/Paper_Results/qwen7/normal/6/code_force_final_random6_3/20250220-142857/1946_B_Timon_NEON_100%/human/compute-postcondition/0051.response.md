Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, depending on whether `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`; `max_segment` is updated to the better segment found; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `segments_variants`, `max_segment`, or `max_sum`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains as described in the initial state, except that `new_segment` is now an empty list.
