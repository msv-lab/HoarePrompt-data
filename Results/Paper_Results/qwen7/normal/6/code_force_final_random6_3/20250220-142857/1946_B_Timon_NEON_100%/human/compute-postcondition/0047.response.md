Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`, `new_segment` remains either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index with the first element increased by `arr[i_end+1]`, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code appends `max_segment + [i - 1]` to `segments_variants`. This means that `segments_variants` now includes this new segment. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
