Postcondition: **`segments_variants` is a list of segments, `new_segment` is either an empty list or a list containing the current element of `arr` and its index, `max_segment` is the best segment found so far based on the sum comparison, and `max_sum` remains `-1`. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` contains the updated `max_segment` plus the current index. Otherwise, `segments_variants` contains the new segment plus the current index, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
