Output State: **`segments_variants` now contains `max_segment` plus the element `len(arr) - 1` and a new list containing `len(arr) - 1`; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` remains the segment with the highest sum found throughout the entire iteration; `max_sum` remains -1.**

Explanation: The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list consists of `new_segment` (which is an empty list) concatenated with `[len(arr) - 1]`. Therefore, the updated `segments_variants` now includes both the original `max_segment` plus the element `len(arr) - 1` and the new list containing only `len(arr) - 1`. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
