Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment', 'i - 1']; `new_segment` remains unchanged; `max_segment` is ['new_segment[0]', 'new_segment[1]']; `max_sum` is -1; `len(arr)` is at least 1; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0; `max_segment[0]` is equal to `new_segment[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `max_segment = new_segment` updates the `max_segment` variable to be equal to the `new_segment` variable. Since `new_segment` is specified as `['new_segment', 'i - 1']`, `max_segment` will also be set to `['new_segment[0]', 'new_segment[1]']`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
