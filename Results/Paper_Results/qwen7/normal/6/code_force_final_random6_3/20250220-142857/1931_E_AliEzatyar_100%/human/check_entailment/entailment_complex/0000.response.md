Reasoning:
1. The problem involves a game between Sasha and Anna where they take turns modifying a list of integers according to specific rules.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules and constraints.
3. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer.
4. The main part of the program processes each test case as follows:
   - Reads the number of integers (`n`) and the parameter `m`.
   - Reads the list of integers.
   - Counts the total number of digits in the list.
   - Counts the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - Determines if Sasha can force a win by checking if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of trailing zeros is at least `m + 1`.
   - Assigns the result ('Sasha' or 'Anna') to the corresponding test case in the `answers` list.
5. The program prints the results for each test case correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
