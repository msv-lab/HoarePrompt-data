The function accepts an integer num (where 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9) and returns the count of trailing zeros in its string representation. It iterates through the string representation of num from the end to the beginning, counting the number of consecutive '0' characters until it encounters a non-zero character or reaches the start of the string.
