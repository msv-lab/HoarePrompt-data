Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; n is an input integer; the array a is updated to a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `arr`. The original array `a` is now updated to this new list of integers. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is set to the input integer which determines the length of the array `arr`.
