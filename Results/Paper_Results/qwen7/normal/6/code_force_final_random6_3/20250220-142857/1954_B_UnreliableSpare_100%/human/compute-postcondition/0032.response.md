Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is `1`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially not defined, it is assumed to be 0 before this line of code. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
