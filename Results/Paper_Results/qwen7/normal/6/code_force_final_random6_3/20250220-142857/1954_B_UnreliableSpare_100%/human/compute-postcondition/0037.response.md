Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `flag` is `False`
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is `n`

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, and the loop iterates over the range `range(n)`, the loop will not execute because `n` is out of the valid range for `i` (which should be from `0` to `n-1`).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop does not execute due to `i` being equal to `n`, we need to adjust `i` to `0` to start the next iteration.

6. **Maintain other states**:
   - `flag` remains `False` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`**
