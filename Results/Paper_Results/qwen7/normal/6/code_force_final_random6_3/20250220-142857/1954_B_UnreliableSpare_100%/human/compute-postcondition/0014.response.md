Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `flag` remains `False`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `1 <= i < n`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.
   - The condition `1 <= i < n` must still hold true, meaning `i` should still be within the range `[1, n)`.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `flag` remains `False` as there is no indication that it changes within the loop.
   - `t` remains the same since there is no mention of `t` being modified within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same since the loop does not modify `n`.
   - `arr` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `arr` remains the same.

7. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `flag` remains `False`.
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`flag` remains `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3**.
