Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `cnt` is equal to `cnt + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables (`flag`, `t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
