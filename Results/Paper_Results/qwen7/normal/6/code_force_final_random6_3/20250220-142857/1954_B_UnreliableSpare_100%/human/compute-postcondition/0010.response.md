Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**

The code simply reassigns the variable `flag` to `False`, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
