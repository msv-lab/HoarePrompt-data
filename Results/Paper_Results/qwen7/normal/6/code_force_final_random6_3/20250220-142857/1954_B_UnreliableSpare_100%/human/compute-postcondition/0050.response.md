Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. For each test case, the function returns whether the given conditions are met.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters and a conditionally beautiful array. It checks if the array meets certain criteria based on the given constraints and returns a result accordingly.
