Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is `True`
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is `0`
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` after updating it with `min(ans, cnt)`, where `cnt` is `0`

The `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
