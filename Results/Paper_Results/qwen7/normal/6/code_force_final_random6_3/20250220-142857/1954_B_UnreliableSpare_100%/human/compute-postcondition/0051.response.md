Functionality: **The function processes a single test case consisting of an integer `n`, an array `arr` of length `n`, and implicitly an integer `t`. It checks if the array `arr` is monotonically the same (i.e., all elements are identical). If the array is not monotonically the same, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements in the array. Finally, it prints `-1` if the array is monotonically the same, otherwise it prints the calculated minimum count.**
