You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array a is beautiful; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `flag` is set to `False` as soon as any two consecutive elements in the array `arr` are found to be different, causing the loop to break. Since the loop breaks on the first difference encountered, `flag` remains `False` regardless of how many iterations it takes to find the difference. The variable `t` and the condition on `n` (which must be greater than 1) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
        
    #State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, and `cnt` is `0`
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `flag` is either `True` or `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr` after updating it with `min(ans, cnt)`, and `cnt` is `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. For each test case, the function returns whether the given conditions are met.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
