Output State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and if `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `flag` is set to `False` as soon as any two consecutive elements in the array `arr` are found to be different, causing the loop to break. Since the loop breaks on the first difference encountered, `flag` remains `False` regardless of how many iterations it takes to find the difference. The variable `t` and the condition on `n` (which must be greater than 1) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
