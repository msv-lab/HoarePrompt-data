Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is not equal to the current value of `arr[i - 1]' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are updated or reassigned, their previous states remain unchanged.
