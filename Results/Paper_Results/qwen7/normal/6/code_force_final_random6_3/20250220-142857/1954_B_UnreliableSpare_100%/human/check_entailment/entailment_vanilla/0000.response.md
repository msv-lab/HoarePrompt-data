Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the array to count the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
   - The minimum number of removals required is the length of the longest sequence minus one, as removing all but one element in this sequence would make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the array is already uniform.
   - The logic for counting the longest sequence of identical elements is sound and correctly calculates the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Functionality Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` is called within the main loop for each test case, which is appropriate.
   - The use of `Decimal` from the `decimal` module is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The code correctly identifies whether the array is uniform and handles this case appropriately.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is correct and follows the problem requirements.

Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
