Output State: `flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is equal to `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. If at any point `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i-1]`, the loop breaks and sets `flag` to `False`. Since the loop has executed all its iterations (from 1 to `n-1`), and assuming the condition `arr[i] != arr[i-1]` was met at some point during these iterations, `flag` remains `False`. The value of `t` and `n` do not change within the loop, so they retain their initial values.
