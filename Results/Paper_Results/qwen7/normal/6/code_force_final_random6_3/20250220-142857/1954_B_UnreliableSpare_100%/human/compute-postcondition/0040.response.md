Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `0`, `cnt` is `0`, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value (which is not specified but assumed to be greater than or equal to `cnt` since `cnt` is set to 0) and `cnt`, which remains 0.
