Output State: **`flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. However, since the initial values of `ans` and `cnt` are not specified, we only know that `ans` has been updated to this new minimum value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
