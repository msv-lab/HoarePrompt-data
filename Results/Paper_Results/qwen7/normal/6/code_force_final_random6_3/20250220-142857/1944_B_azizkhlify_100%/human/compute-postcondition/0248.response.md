Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` must be at least 3
- If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop or if statement we were inside is broken out.

The `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is at least 3, `i` must be at least 4. Since the exact value of `i` and the contents of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
