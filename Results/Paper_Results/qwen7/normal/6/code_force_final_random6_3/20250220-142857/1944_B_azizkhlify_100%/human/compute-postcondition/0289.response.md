Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. However, the initial values of `r` and `a` are not provided, so we cannot specify the exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]`. We know that `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
