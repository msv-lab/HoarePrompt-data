Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code takes two inputs from the user separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Therefore, `n` and `k` now hold the integer values provided by the user.
