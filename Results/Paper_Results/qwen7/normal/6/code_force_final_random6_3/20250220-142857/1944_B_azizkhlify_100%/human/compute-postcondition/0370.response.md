Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be less than or equal to 3; `a[3]` exists and its value is used to index `r`, and the element at that index in `r` is now 0; `ur` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ur` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
