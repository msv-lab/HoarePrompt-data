Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `re` is 1.
- `res` is a list containing `a[1]`.

However, there is no explicit definition of `a` in the initial state. Since `a` is not defined, we cannot determine the value of `a[1]`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed by `a[i]`.

Given the information, we know that `i` is 2, so `a[i]` would refer to `a[2]`. But without knowing the value of `a[2]`, we can only describe it as the second element of the list `a`.

Output: **[a[2]]**
