Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be at least 3, `ur` is 2 more than its initial value, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, making it 2 more than its initial value. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
