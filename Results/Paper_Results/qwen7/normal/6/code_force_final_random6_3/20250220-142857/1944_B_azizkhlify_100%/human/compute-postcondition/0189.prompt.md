Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `l` will contain the count of how many times each integer from `1` to `n` appears in the list `a`. Specifically, `l[j]` will hold the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n`, `n` will be the original value of `k`, and `r` will be a list of length `n` where each element is the count of occurrences of the corresponding index plus one in `a`. The variables `ul`, `ur`, and `res` will remain as they were in the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being `2 * n`, and `n` being the original value of `k`. The list `res` will still be an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, and `ul` is increased by 2, assuming that `ul` equals `k * 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, and `ul` is increased by 4. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, and `ul` is increased by 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2 and `ul == k * 2`. Otherwise, `i` and `ul` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
