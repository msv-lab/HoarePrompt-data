Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `res` contains at least one element and there are elements left to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the next element in `res`.
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `res`, after the current iteration, `i` will no longer be part of `res`.
   - For the loop to continue, `res` must still contain at least one element. Since `i` was the next element, removing it should leave at least one element in `res`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `res`, and `res` must still contain at least one element.

**State: **`i` is the next element in `res`, `res` must contain at least one element**
