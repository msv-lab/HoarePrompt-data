Postcondition: **`k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is `2 * n`, `r[j]` (for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`) contains the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`, `ul` is `2 * k` if the loop exited because `ul == k * 2`, or it is the last value calculated before the loop potentially exited, and `l` has been updated such that for each `a[i]`, the corresponding element in `l` is set to 0. The value of `k` is non-zero**.
