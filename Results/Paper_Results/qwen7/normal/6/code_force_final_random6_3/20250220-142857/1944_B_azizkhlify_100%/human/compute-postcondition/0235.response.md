Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop will iterate from `n` to `2 * n - 1` (inclusive).
   - After the loop completes, `i` will hold the value `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will print each element of the list `res` exactly once.
   - Initially, `res` contains the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`.
   - After the loop completes, `res` will be empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute and that it prints all elements of `res` exactly once.
   - The loop will start with `i = n` and increment `i` until `i < 2 * n`.
   - For the loop to execute correctly, `n` must be at least 3 (since `res` has 3 elements).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3**
