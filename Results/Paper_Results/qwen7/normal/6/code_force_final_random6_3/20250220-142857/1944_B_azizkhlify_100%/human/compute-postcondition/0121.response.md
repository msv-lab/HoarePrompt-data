Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was previously equal to 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - There is a condition to break out of the loop if `ul == ur`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop.

5. **Consider the postcondition and loop termination condition**:
   - The loop will terminate if `i` reaches `2 * n`.
   - The postcondition does not affect the values of `i` and `n` directly but ensures that `r[a[i] - 1]` is updated correctly and there is no early exit due to `ul == ur`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 5000).
- `a` remains the same (a list of integers).
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was previously equal to 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
- The loop will continue unless `i` reaches `2 * n` or `ul == ur`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was previously equal to 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged.**
