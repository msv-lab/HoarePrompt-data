Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `k` is defined as `4 * k - ul`.
   - `ul` is defined as `k * 2`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` will iterate over elements in `res`.
   - Since `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, it implies that `a[i] - 1` must be an index where `l` has a value of 1.

3. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is `print(i, end=' ')`.
   - This will print the current value of `i` during iteration, followed by a space due to `end=' '`.

4. **Determine What Will Be Printed:**
   - During the iteration, `i` will take on the indices of `res` one by one.
   - For each `i`, `l[a[i] - 1]` must be 1, meaning `a[i] - 1` is an index in `l` where the value is 1.

Given this understanding, the output will be the sequence of indices `i` as `i` iterates over the elements in `res`, separated by spaces.

Output: **0 1 2 ... (where the sequence of indices i is printed, starting from 0 up to the length of res - 1, with each index separated by a space)**
