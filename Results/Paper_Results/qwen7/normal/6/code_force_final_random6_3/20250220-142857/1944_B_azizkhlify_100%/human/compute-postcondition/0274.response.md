Output State: **`a[1]` is printed, `a[2]` is printed, `a[3]` is printed followed by a space, `i` is now set to `a[3]`, `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code sets `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` are still printed, `i` is now `a[3]`, and `res` remains an empty list. The values of `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are updated to 0. The lists `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
