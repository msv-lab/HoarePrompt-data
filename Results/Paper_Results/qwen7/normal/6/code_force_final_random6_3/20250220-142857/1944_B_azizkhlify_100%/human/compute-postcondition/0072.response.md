Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `re` is 1, `res` is a list with the element `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) to the list `res`. Since `i` is 1, `res` now contains the element `a[1]`. The values of `n` and `re` remain unchanged.
