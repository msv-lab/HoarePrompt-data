Output: **3 **

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- The variable `res` is mentioned to contain at least one element, but since the `print` statement does not reference `res`, it is not included in the output.
- The variable `re` is given as 2, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, without a newline. Since only `i` is referenced, the output will be the value of `i`, which is 3, followed by a space.
