Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the original value of `k`, and `res` contains the element `a[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `res`. The conditions and values of these variables remain the same as the initial state, and we simply indicate that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
