Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the next element in `res`.
- `res` must contain at least one element.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the next element in the list `res`. Since `res` contains at least one element, `i` will be the first element of `res`.

Output: **the first element of res**
