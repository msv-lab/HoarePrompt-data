Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is `2 * n`, `r[j]` (for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`) contains the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`, `ul` is `2 * k` if the loop exited because `ul == k * 2`, or it is the last value calculated before the loop potentially exited, and `l` has been updated such that for each `a[i]`, the corresponding element in `l` is set to 0. The value of `k` is non-zero
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[j]` (for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`) contains the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`, `ul` is `2 * k` if the loop exited because `ul == k * 2`, or it is the last value calculated before the loop potentially exited, and `l` has been updated such that for each `a[i]`, the corresponding element in `l` is set to 0; `re` is equal to `k`; `res` contains the value of `a[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[j]` (for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`) contains the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`, `ul` is `2 * k` if the loop exited because `ul == k * 2`, or it is the last value calculated before the loop potentially exited, `l` has been updated such that for each `a[i]`, the corresponding element in `l` is set to 0; `re` is equal to `k + 1`, `res` contains the value of `a[i]` and `res` is appended with `a[i]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is equal to `2 * k - ul`, `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[j]` (for `j` ranging from `0` to `n-1`) contains the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`, `ul` is `2 * k` if the loop exited because `ul == k * 2`, or it is the last value calculated before the loop potentially exited, `l` has been updated such that for each `a[i]`, the corresponding element in `l` is set to 0; `re` is equal to `k + 2`, `res` contains the value of `a[i]` and `res` is appended with `a[i]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
