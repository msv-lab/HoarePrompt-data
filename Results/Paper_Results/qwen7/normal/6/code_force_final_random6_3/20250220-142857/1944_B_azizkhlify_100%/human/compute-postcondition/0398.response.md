Postcondition: **The output consists of the elements printed during each iteration, which are `a[3] a[3]` and `a[4] a[4]`, separated by spaces. The variable `i` is set to `5`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The value of `n` remains less than or equal to 3, and the array `r` has been updated such that the elements indexed by `a[3] - 1` and `a[4] - 1` are set to 0. The variable `ur` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, resulting in `ur` being 4. The variable `ul` remains unchanged unless it equals `ur`, in which case the loop would break, but since the condition `ul != ur` is true, the loop completes all iterations.**
