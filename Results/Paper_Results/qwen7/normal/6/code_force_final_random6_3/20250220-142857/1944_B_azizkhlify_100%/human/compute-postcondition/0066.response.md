Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `res` contains the element `a[i]` if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 1, otherwise the value of `res` remains unchanged, and `re` is equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `res`, and `re`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
