Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the first element in `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, which is the first element of `res`, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **the first element of res**
