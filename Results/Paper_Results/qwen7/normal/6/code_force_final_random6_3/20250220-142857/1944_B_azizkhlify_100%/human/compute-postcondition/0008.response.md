Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` incremented by 1, `r` is a list of n zeros, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so the code increments the value at index `a[0] - 1` (since `a[i]` becomes `a[0]` when `i` is 0) by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
