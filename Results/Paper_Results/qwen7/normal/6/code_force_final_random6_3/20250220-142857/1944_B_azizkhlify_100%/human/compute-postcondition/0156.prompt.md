Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the list `l` will be updated such that each index `j` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`) will contain the count of how many times the value `j+1` appears in the list `a`. The variables `i`, `n`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being equal to `n`, and `n` being the original value of `k`. The lists `r` and `res` will remain unchanged and will still be lists of `n` zeros and an empty list, respectively.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `l` will show the frequency of each number in `a` (shifted by one, since we use `a[i] - 1`), and all other variables will be in their final states from the last loop iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `n` is the original value of `k`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the original value of `k`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is the original value of `k`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
