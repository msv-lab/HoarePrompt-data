Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in res:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue executing, `res` must contain at least one element, and `i` must be an element of `res`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` must contain at least one element.
   - `re` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop continuation).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, it needs to be set to the next element in `res`.
   - `res` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next element in `res`, and `res` still contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is the next element in `res`, `res` must contain at least one element**
