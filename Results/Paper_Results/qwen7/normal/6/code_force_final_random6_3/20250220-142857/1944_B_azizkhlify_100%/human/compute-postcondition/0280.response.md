Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1
- `i` is `i + 1`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `i` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop itself. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i` must still be less than `n`.

### Updated State:
- Since `i` was incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i_new` must be less than `n`.

### Final State:
- `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` must remain the same for the loop condition to be checked correctly.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
