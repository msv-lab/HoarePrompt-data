Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `res`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - `i` will iterate over elements in `res`.
   - `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `k` is `4 * k - ul`.
   - `ul` is `k * 2`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `res`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `res`.
   - The condition `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 must still hold true for the next element in `res`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `res`.
   - `res` remains the same as it is being iterated over.
   - `n`, `k`, and `ul` do not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` will be the next element in `res`.
- `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `k` is `4 * k - ul`.
- `ul` is `k * 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` will iterate over elements in `res`, `res` contains elements such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is `4 * k - ul`, `ul` is `k * 2`**
