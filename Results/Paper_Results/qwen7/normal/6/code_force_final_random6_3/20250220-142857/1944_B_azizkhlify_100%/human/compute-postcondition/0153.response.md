Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is the original value of `k`
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 2 * n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 2`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 2`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the original value of `k`.
   - The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` is not directly relevant to the loop condition but might change inside the loop body. Since we are only asked to adjust the loop head states, we don't need to change this state here.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is `n + 2`
   - `n` is the original value of `k`
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` remains as it was incremented in the previous iteration (but we don't need to specify its exact value for the loop condition)

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is the original value of `k`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
