Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` is less than or equal to 3; `ur` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before the operation). After the operation, `ur` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state. The expression `r[a[4] - 1]` is not affected by the given code snippet.
