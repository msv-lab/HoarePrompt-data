Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This matches the problem's requirements.
2. **Counter Initialization**: The code initializes counters for both `b` and the initial segment of `a` (first `m` elements). This is done correctly using `Counter(sorted(b))` and `Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`.
3. **Initial Matching Count**: The variable `sm` is used to keep track of the number of matching elements between the sorted segments of `a` and `b`. This is calculated correctly as `sum((ca & cb).values())`.
4. **Sliding Window Technique**: The code uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`. It updates the counter `ca` and adjusts the count `sm` as the window slides through the array.
5. **Condition Check**: The condition `if sm >= k:` checks if the current subsegment meets the requirement of having at least `k` matching elements with `b`. If true, it increments the answer `ans`.
6. **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where the initial segment already meets the requirement, which is correctly accounted for in the first iteration of the loop.
7. **Output**: The function returns the count of good subsegments, which is printed in the main loop.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
