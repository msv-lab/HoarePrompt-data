### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This matches the problem's requirements.
2. **Counter Initialization**: The code initializes counters for both `b` and the initial segment of `a` (first `m` elements). This is done correctly using `Counter(sorted(b))` and `Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`.
3. **Initial Matching Count**: The variable `sm` is used to keep track of the number of matching elements between the sorted segments of `a` and `b`. However, there is a critical issue here. The initial matching count is calculated using `Counter(sorted(a[:m]))` and `Counter(sorted(b))`, but this sorting step is unnecessary and incorrect. The elements in `a` and `b` should be matched without sorting, as the order of elements matters.
4. **Sliding Window Technique**: The code uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`. It updates the counter `ca` and adjusts the count `sm` as the window slides through the array. This part of the logic is correct.
5. **Condition Check**: The condition `if sm >= k:` checks if the current subsegment meets the requirement of having at least `k` matching elements with `b`. If true, it increments the answer `ans`. This is correct.
6. **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where the initial segment already meets the requirement, which is correctly accounted for in the first iteration of the loop.
7. **Output**: The function returns the count of good subsegments, which is printed in the main loop.

However, the initial matching count calculation is incorrect because it sorts the subarray `a[:m]` and the array `b`. Sorting changes the relative order of elements, which is not what we want. We need to directly compare the counts of elements in the subarray `a[:m]` and the array `b` without sorting.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was incorrect due to the unnecessary sorting of the subarray `a[:m]` and the array `b`. The corrected code removes this sorting and directly compares the counts of elements in the subarray `a[:m]` and the array `b`.

**Final: False**
