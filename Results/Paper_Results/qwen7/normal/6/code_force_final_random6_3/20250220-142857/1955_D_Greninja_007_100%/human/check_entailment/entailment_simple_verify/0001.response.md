### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This matches the problem's requirements.
2. **Counter Initialization**: The code initializes counters for both `b` and the initial segment of `a` (first `m` elements). This is done correctly using `Counter(sorted(b))` and `Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`.
3. **Initial Matching Count**: The variable `sm` is used to keep track of the number of matching elements between the sorted segments of `a` and `b`. This is calculated correctly as `sum((ca & cb).values())`.

However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

4. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - The sliding window approach is intended to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`. The code updates the counter `ca` and adjusts the count `sm` as the window slides through the array.
   - The issue lies in how `sm` is updated. The code only increments `sm` when `ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]`, but it should also decrement `sm` when `ca[a[r - m]] > cb[a[r - m]]`. This ensures that `sm` accurately reflects the number of matching elements as the window slides.
   - Specifically, the line `if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]: sm += 1` is correct, but the line `if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]: sm -= 1` is incorrect. It should be `if ca[a[r - m]] > cb[a[r - m]]: sm -= 1`.

5. **Condition Check**: The condition `if sm >= k:` checks if the current subsegment meets the requirement of having at least `k` matching elements with `b`. If true, it increments the answer `ans`. This condition is correct, but the logic inside the loop needs to be fixed as mentioned above.

6. **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where the initial segment already meets the requirement, which is correctly accounted for in the first iteration of the loop. However, the sliding window logic needs to be corrected as mentioned.

7. **Output**: The function returns the count of good subsegments, which is printed in the main loop. This part is correct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the provided program is correct. The sliding window logic has a flaw in how `sm` is updated, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
