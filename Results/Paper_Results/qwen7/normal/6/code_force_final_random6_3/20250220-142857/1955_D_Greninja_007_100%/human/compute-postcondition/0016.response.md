Output State: **`ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `sm` is decremented by 1, if `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is incremented by 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `sm` compared to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `sm -= 1` decrements the value of `sm` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `ca[a[r]]` is incremented by 1, `sm` is now one less than its previous value, the condition regarding `ca[a[r - m]]` and `cb[a[r - m]]` remains the same, `m` is still less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is still either 0 or 1 depending on the comparison between `sm` and `k`.
