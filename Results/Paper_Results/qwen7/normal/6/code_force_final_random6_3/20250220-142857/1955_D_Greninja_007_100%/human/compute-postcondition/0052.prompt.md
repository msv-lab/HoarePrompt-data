You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is 0, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ca[a[r - m]]` will have been decremented by 1 for each element `a[r - m]` encountered during the loop. The variable `sm` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 after each full cycle through the loop (since `sm` is adjusted based on the comparison between `ca[a[r - m]]` and `cb[a[r - m]]`, and this comparison is part of the loop). The variable `m` will still be less than or equal to `n` as it is not modified within the loop. Finally, `ans` will be the total count of iterations where `sm` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the total count of iterations where `sm` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns `ans`, which is the total count of iterations where the sum of the first `i` elements in list `a` (denoted as `sm`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `ans`, which is the total count of iterations where `sm` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
