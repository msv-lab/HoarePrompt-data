Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Note

In the first example, all subsegments are good.

In the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1 , 2 , and 3 .

In the third example, good subsegments start at positions 1 and 2 .

# Annotated Program:
from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ca[a[r - m]]` is decremented by 1, `sm` is 0, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is increased by 1 for every iteration where `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ca[a[r - m]]` will have been decremented by 1 for each element `a[r - m]` encountered during the loop. The variable `sm` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 after each full cycle through the loop (since `sm` is adjusted based on the comparison between `ca[a[r - m]]` and `cb[a[r - m]]`, and this comparison is part of the loop). The variable `m` will still be less than or equal to `n` as it is not modified within the loop. Finally, `ans` will be the total count of iterations where `sm` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is the total count of iterations where `sm` was found to be greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It returns the total count (`ans`) of iterations where the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both sorted sublists `a[:m]` and `b` (denoted as `sm`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
