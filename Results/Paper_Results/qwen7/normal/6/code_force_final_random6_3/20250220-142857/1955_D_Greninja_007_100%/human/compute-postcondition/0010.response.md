Output State: **`sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb` plus 1, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `sm` compared to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `sm += 1` increments the value of `sm` by 1. Since `ca[a[r]]` is less than `cb[a[r]]`, the condition for updating `sm` is met, and `sm` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.
