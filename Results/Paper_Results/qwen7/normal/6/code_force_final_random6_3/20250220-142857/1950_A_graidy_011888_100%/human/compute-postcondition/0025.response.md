Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`. Since `i` is initially 1, the loop will run if `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. So, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Ensure the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Update the state**: Based on the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, and `n` must be greater than 2**.
