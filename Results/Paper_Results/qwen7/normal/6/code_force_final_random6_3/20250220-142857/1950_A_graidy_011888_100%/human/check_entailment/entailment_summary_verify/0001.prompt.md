You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)). For each test case, if the integer \(t\) (which is read at the beginning and is the number of test cases) is within the range 1 to 1000, the function checks the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It then prints 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. If \(t\) is outside the specified range, the function skips the test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the inputs are treated as integers.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: It then checks if `a < b and b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NONE'.

Now, let's verify if the logic matches the problem statement:

- **Stair Condition**: The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a stair.
- **Peak Condition**: The condition `a < b and b > c` correctly identifies a peak.
- **Default Case**: The default case correctly handles all other combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given that the program correctly implements the conditions for a stair and a peak, and handles all other cases appropriately, the program is correct according to the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**
