Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user and their values are updated to the values of the integers entered.

The print statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement will print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **'NONE'**
