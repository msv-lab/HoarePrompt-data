Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, i is equal to n-1, a, b, and c are integers entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the ones entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop, as these variables are reassigned each time through the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop since it was only defined in the initial state and not modified within the loop.
