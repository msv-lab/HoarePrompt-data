Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`, and `y` is an even number.**

The code `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` calculates the integer division of `y` by 2 and assigns the result to `screen_require_for_y`. Since `y` is an even number, `y // 2` will be an integer value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
