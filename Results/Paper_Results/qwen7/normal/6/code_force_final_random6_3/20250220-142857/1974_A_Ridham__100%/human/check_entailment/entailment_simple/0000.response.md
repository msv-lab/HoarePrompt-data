Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading `x` and `y` for each case.
2. **Space Calculation**: 
   - `space_x` calculates the total space needed for `x` 1x1 icons, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` calculates the total space needed for `y` 2x2 icons, which is `y * 4`.
   - `total_space` calculates the combined space needed for all icons.
3. **Screen Requirement Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `screen_require_for_y` calculates the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons. This is done by dividing `y` by 2 (if even) or by 2 and adding 1 (if odd).
4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `space_x` (the space needed for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then the number of screens required is just `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, the program calculates how many additional screens (`extra_screen`) are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.
5. **Output**:
   - The program appends the calculated number of screens to the `result` list for each test case.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The calculation of `remaining_cells` should consider the total space available on the screens, which is `15 * screen_require_for_y`.
- The logic to calculate `extra_screen` is flawed because it does not correctly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
