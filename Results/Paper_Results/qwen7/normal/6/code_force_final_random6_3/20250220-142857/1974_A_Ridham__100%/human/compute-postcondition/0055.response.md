Output State: **`remaining_cells` is updated to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `screen_require_for_y + extra_screen` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` or `y // 2 + 2` if `y` is odd, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is calculated as `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `extra_screen` is calculated as `(space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions as described in the initial state.
