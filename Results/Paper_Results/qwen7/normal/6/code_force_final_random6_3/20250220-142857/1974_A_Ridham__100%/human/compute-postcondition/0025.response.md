Postcondition: **`remaining_cells` is 15 * `screen_require_for_y` - `space_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` is a list containing either `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `x` is an integer from the input split, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `y` is either even or odd, `screen_require_for_y` is either `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1, and if `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` contains `screen_require_for_y`; otherwise, `result` contains `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is calculated based on `extra_space` being either divisible by 15 or not.**
