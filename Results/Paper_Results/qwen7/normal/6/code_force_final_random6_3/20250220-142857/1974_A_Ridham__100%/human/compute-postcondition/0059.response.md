Output State: **The final state of the loop will have `t` remaining as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` will be a list containing the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each iteration where `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, and `x` and `y` will be the last integers provided by the input split during the last iteration of the loop.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 10,000, as it was not modified within the loop. The `result` list will contain the cumulative results of each iteration, specifically the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` whenever `space_x` was greater than `remaining_cells`. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers that were processed by the loop.
