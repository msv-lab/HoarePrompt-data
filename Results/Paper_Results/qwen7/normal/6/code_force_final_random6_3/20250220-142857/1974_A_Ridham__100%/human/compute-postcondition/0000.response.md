Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as a positive integer within the specified range.
