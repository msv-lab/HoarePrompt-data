Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y`. For each pair, it calculates a value based on the relationship between `x`, `y`, and certain derived values like `space_x`, `space_y`, and `remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, it appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates `extra_screen` and appends the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y` to the result list. Finally, it prints a list of these calculated values, one per line.**
