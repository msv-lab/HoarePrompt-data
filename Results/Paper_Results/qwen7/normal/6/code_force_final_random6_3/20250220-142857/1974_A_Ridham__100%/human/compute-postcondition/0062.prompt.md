You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: The final state of the loop will have `t` remaining as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `result` will be a list containing the sum of `screen_require_for_y` and `extra_screen` for each iteration where `space_x` exceeds `remaining_cells`, and `x` and `y` will be the last integers provided by the input split during the last iteration of the loop.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: a list of sums (each sum is screen_require_for_y + extra_screen for each iteration where space_x > remaining_cells), each sum on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
