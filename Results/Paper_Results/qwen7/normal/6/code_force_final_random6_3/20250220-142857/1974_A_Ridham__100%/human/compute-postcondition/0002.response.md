State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable and `range(n)` to determine the number of iterations. The only variable from the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `n`.
2. Determine the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
3. Adjust the state: Since `t`, `n`, and `result` are the only variables mentioned in the problem, we need to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to include the condition that `n` must be greater than 0.
