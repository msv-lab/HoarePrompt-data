Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `n` is an input integer.
  - `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `range(t)`, which means the loop variable `_` (a placeholder) will iterate from `0` to `t-1`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `n` or `nums` within its body; it only iterates `t` times.
   - Therefore, the only variables affected by the loop itself are `t` and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since the loop does not modify `n` or `nums`, their values remain unchanged.
   - The loop counter `_` will be incremented each time the loop runs. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has run `t` times.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop has already run `t` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than `t`.
   - This is a contradiction because `t` cannot be greater than itself. Therefore, the loop will not execute again if `t` is the number of iterations already completed.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop has already run `t` times, there is no valid state adjustment that would allow the loop to execute one more time based on the provided information.

### Final Answer:
Since the loop has already completed `t` iterations, it will not execute one more time. Thus, no state adjustment is needed.

**State: **`n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `t` is the number of iterations already completed.**
