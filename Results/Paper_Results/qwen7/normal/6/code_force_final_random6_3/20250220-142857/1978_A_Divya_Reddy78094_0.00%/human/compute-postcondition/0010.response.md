Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is the number of iterations already completed.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

Given that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `nums[0]` represents the largest integer in the list, and `nums[1]` represents the second largest integer in the list. The sum of these two elements will be printed.

Output: **the sum of the largest and second largest integers in the list nums**
