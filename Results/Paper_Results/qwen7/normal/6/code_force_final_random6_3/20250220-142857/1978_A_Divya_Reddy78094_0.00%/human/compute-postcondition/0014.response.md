Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is t + 1, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `nums` in descending order using the `sort(reverse=True)` method. This means that the elements in `nums` will be arranged from the largest to the smallest. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
