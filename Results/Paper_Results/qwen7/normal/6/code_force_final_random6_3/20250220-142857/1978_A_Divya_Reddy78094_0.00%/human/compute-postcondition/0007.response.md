Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `t` is the number of iterations already completed, `n` is reassigned the value of int(input())**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning this new value back to the variable `n`. The other variables (`nums` and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
