Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is t + 1, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting, and `n` is assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t` and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
