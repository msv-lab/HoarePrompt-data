Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be equal to the initial value of `t` plus the number of times the loop has run (which is 3 in this case, as per the given states). The variable `n` will be an input integer for each iteration, and `nums` will be a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting for each iteration. The final state will have `t` updated to reflect the total number of iterations completed, and `nums` will be the result of sorting the input list of integers in descending order for the last iteration.

In simpler terms: `t` will be increased by 3, making it the initial value of `t` plus 3. For each of these iterations, `n` will be an input integer, and `nums` will be a list of integers sorted in descending order based on the input provided for that specific iteration.
