Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the input integer; `n` is an unknown integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); the list of integers `a` representing the number of pages in each book is not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    print(nums[0] + nums[1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `t` is the number of iterations already completed, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer, `t` is t + 1, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
