Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.
- The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of books (`n`) and the list of pages (`nums`).
- The program then sorts the list of pages in descending order, ensuring that the highest number of pages is at the start of the list.
- Finally, it prints the sum of the first two elements of the sorted list, which corresponds to the sum of the highest number of pages in each pile.

Given the logic of the program and the problem statement, the program correctly implements the solution by always choosing the two largest values from the input list, which ensures the maximum possible total number of pages read.

Correctness: **True**
