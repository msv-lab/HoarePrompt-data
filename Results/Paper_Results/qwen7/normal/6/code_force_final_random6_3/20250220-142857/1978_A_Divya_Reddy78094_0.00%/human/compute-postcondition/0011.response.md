Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `t`, which represents the number of iterations already completed.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be less than the total number of iterations specified by the input integer `n`.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**: Since the only variable in the loop head is `t`, we need to adjust its value for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is the number of iterations already completed. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **Consider the initial conditions**: Initially, `t` is 0 because no iterations have been completed yet. After each iteration, `t` increases by 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**: If `t` is currently `t`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be `t + 1`.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is the number of iterations already completed plus 1, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting**

To express it more concretely:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is t + 1, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after sorting**
