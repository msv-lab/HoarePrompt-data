Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous element and the previous element is greater than or equal to 10, the program performs the specified operation:
     - It removes the current element.
     - It inserts the digits of the removed element into the array in the same position.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing the array, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling:**
   - The program assumes that performing the operation will always lead to a sorted array, but this is not necessarily true.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. After the first operation, it becomes `[12, 4, 5, 67]`, and after the second operation, it becomes `[1, 2, 4, 5, 67]`. However, the array is not sorted yet, and further operations might not sort it correctly.

2. **Lack of Correctness in Logic:**
   - The program does not ensure that the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations. It only checks if the final array is sorted, which is insufficient.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential:**
   - There is no mechanism to prevent an infinite loop if the operations do not lead to a sorted array. The program may repeatedly perform the same operations without converging to a sorted state.

### Conclusion

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
