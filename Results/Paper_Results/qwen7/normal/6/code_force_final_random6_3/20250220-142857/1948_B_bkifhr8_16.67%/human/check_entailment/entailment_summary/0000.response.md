Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to sort the array by repeatedly splitting elements that are greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits.
2. However, the implementation of the logic to split elements and insert the digits back into the array is flawed. Specifically:
   - The loop that splits elements assumes that the array will always be modified correctly, but it does not handle cases where multiple large numbers need to be split consecutively.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly manage the indices when inserting new digits, potentially leading to incorrect results.
3. Additionally, the program relies on the `func_1` function to check if the array is sorted, which is correct in its implementation.
4. Despite the flaws in the main logic, the overall structure of the program is designed to attempt sorting the array, and the `func_1` function is correctly implemented to verify if the array is sorted.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to split and reorder the array elements as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
