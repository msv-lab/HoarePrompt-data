### Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution step by step to verify its correctness.

#### Understanding `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes the first element of the row to 1 and increments the next `d-1` elements by 2. This ensures that the first support is placed at the start and the next few supports are placed close to it.
   - For example, if `d` is 5, the first 5 elements of the row will be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row. Each element in the heap is a tuple `(value, index)` where `value` is the cost of placing a support at that index.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - For each subsequent element in the row (starting from index `d`), the function pops the smallest element from the heap.
   - If the popped element's index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, it means the distance between the current support and the previous support is more than `d`, so the loop continues without updating the row.
   - Otherwise, the function updates the current element in the row with the sum of the popped element's value, the current element's value, and 1. This ensures that the distance condition is met.
   - The function then pushes the updated value back into the heap along with the current index.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the value of the last element in the row, which represents the cost of placing the last support.

#### Understanding `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the dimensions of the river (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of the river cells for each row.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each row, the function calls `func_1` to get the minimum cost of placing supports.
   - These costs are stored in the `costs` list.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - It iterates through the `costs` list and appends the sum of every `k` consecutive elements to the `total_costs` list.

4. **Result Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

### Verification of `func_1`:
- The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements of the row.
- It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
- The logic for updating the cost of placing supports ensures that the distance condition is met.
- The function correctly returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

### Verification of `func_2`:
- The function correctly reads the input for a single test case.
- It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports.
- It calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
- The function correctly prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of placing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended and handle the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
