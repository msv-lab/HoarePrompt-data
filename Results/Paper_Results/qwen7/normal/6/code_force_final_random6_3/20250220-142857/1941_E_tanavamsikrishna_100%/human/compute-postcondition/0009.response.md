Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1`.
   - `i` is currently 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. 

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - The condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must still hold true for the next iteration.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements from the `costs` list and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1`; `i` is 3.**
