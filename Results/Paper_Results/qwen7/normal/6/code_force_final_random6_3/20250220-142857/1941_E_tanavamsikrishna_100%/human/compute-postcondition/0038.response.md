Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```python
   while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
   ```
   This means the loop continues as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `d-2`.
   - `d` must be greater than 1.
   - `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`.
   - `min_heap` contains a new tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is `-5` or less.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(e[1] := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must hold true at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `i` is fixed at `d-2` and does not change within the loop.
   - The variable `d` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
   - The length of `row` must still be greater than `d-1`.
   - The `min_heap` must contain a tuple such that when the smallest element (by the second element) is popped, it satisfies the condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.

5. **Calculate the New Condition:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i = d-2`.
   - Therefore, `i - (d + 2) = (d-2) - (d + 2) = -4`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `-4`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is `d-2`.
   - `d` must be greater than 1.
   - `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`.
   - `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is less than or equal to `-4`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `d-2`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` contains a tuple where the first element is `row[d-4]` and the second element is less than or equal to `-4`.**
