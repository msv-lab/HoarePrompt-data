Output State: **`i` is `d-4`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` must contain a tuple where the second element is `-5` or less.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` was `d-1`. After executing the loop three times, `i` would have been decremented by 3, making it `d-4`. The loop condition ensures that the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is updated to `-d-2` or less after each iteration. Since the loop has executed three times, the second element of the tuple in `min_heap` must now be `-5` or less. The other conditions remain unchanged.
