Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `row` and an integer `d` as inputs.
   - It initializes the first element of `row` to 1 and increments the next `d-1` elements by 2.
   - It then uses a min-heap to ensure that the cost of installing supports in subsequent cells is minimized while maintaining the constraints on the distance between supports.
   - The function correctly updates the `row` list and returns the last element, which represents the total cost for the given row under the specified constraints.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the dimensions and the river depths from the input.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the minimum total cost by summing up the costs of installing supports for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - The function correctly computes the minimum total cost and prints it.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as required.
   - The logic in both functions is consistent with the problem statement and the provided examples.
   - The program outputs the correct results for the given test cases.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
