You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of integers representing the depths of the river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, and each element in the list `row` from index 1 to `d-1` will be incremented by 2 for each corresponding index. In other words, `row[i]` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `d-1` will be `1 + 2*(i)`. All other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
    #
    #This means that if `d` is, for example, 5, then after the loop completes, `row` will be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 0, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` contains tuples where the second element is non-negative, with the first elements being updated values from the `row` list according to the given logic. Specifically, each tuple in `min_heap` has the form `(new_value, index)` where `new_value` is calculated as `e[0] + row[index] + 1` for some `index` starting from `d-1` and incrementing as the loop progresses until `i` reaches 0.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will have decremented from `d-1` to 0, and `min_heap` will contain updated values from the `row` list, reflecting the operations performed within the loop.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row' after updating the min_heap according to the given logic.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: a list of integers `row` representing the depths of river cells, and an integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between supports. After processing the list `row` using a min_heap according to the given logic, the function returns the last element of the list `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list 'row' after updating the min_heap according to the given logic.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
