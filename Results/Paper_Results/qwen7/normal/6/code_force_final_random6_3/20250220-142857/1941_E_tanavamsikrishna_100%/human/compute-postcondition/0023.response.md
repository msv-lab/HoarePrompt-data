Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(d, len(row))`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range from `d` to `len(row) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `d-1-1`, which simplifies to `i` being `d-2`.
   - `d` must be greater than 1.
   - `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`.
   - `min_heap` contains the tuples `(e[0], 0)` and `(row[i-1], i-1)`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be `d-1`.

5. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(row)`. Given that `i` is now `d-1`, the condition `d-1 < len(row)` must hold true.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `d-1`.
   - `d` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
   - `len(row)` remains unchanged and must still be greater than `d-1`.
   - `min_heap` does not change based on the loop head alone, but we know it contains the same tuples unless the loop body modifies it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `d-1`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, and `min_heap` contains the tuples `(e[0], 0)` and `(row[i-1], i-1)`**
