Output State: **`i` is `d-2`, `d` must be greater than 1, `len(row)` must be greater than `d-1`, `min_heap` now contains a tuple where the first element is `e[0]` and the second element is greater than `-4`, and `row[i]` is `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and `min_heap` now includes an additional tuple `(row[i], i)` where `row[i]` is `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

This means that the value of `i` remains `d-2`, `d` and `len(row)` retain their conditions, and `min_heap` now contains the original tuple plus the new tuple `(row[i], i)`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.
