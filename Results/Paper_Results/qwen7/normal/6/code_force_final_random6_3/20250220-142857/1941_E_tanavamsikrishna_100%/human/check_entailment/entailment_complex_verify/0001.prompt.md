You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

In other words, `row[i]` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `d-1` will be `1 + 2*(i)`. All other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
    #
    #This means that if `d` is, for example, 5, then after the loop completes, `row` will be `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

Specifically, each tuple in `min_heap` has the form `(new_value, index)` where `new_value` is calculated as `e[0] + row[index] + 1` for some `index` starting from `d-1` and incrementing as the loop progresses until `i` reaches 0.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will have decremented from `d-1` to 0, and `min_heap` will contain updated values from the `row` list, reflecting the operations performed within the loop.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row' after updating the min_heap according to the given logic.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `row` representing the depths of river cells and an integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between supports. It updates the list `row` by modifying its elements based on a minimum heap operation. Specifically, it increments certain elements in `row` by 2 for the first `d-1` indices, then uses a minimum heap to update the remaining elements according to a specific logic. Finally, it returns the last element of the updated list `row`.

#Function 2:

    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements from the `costs` list, starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element of the `costs` list.
    #
    #This means that if the `costs` list has `n` elements, `total_costs` will contain `n - (k - 1)` sums, each representing the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs contains the sums of every consecutive k elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists called `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` contains \( m \) positive integers representing the depths of river cells, with the first and last elements being 0. The function calculates the sum of every consecutive \( k \) elements from a list of costs derived from `rows`, and then prints the minimum of these sums.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the solution step by step to verify its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row of the river.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of 1 and 2 respectively.
   - For each subsequent element in the row, it ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row of the river to get the minimum cost of placing supports in each row.
   - It then calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Verification of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements of the row.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
   - The logic for updating the cost of placing supports ensures that the distance condition is met.
   - The function correctly returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

4. **Verification of `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input for a single test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports.
   - It calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - The function correctly prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of placing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended and handle the problem as described.
