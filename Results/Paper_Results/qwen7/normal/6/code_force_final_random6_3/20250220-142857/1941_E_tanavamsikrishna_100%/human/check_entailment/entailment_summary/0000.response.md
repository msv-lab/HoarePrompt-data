Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires building bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid to minimize the total cost of installing supports. The cost of installing a support in a cell is the depth of the cell plus one. There are constraints on the placement of supports within each row and across rows.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid to calculate the minimal cost of placing supports under the given constraints.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the lowest cost cells within a sliding window of size `d`.
   - The function correctly updates the row by incrementing certain elements based on the heap operations and returns the final cost of the last cell in the row.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the entire grid by calling `func_1` for each row and storing the results in a list called `costs`.
   - It then calculates the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges over consecutive rows by summing up `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimal cost for placing supports in each row using `func_1`.
   - It then combines these individual row costs to find the optimal placement of `k` bridges over consecutive rows using `func_2`.
   - The program adheres to the problem constraints and produces the expected output.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
