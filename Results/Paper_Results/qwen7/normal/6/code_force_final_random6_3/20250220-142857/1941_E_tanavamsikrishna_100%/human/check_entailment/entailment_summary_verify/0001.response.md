### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided Python program. Let's break down the key points to confirm this:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of 1 and 2 respectively.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` from the current position.
   - The logic for updating the cost of placing supports ensures that the distance condition is met.
   - The function correctly returns the cost of placing the last support in the row.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row of the river to get the minimum cost of placing supports in each row.
   - It calculates the total cost of placing `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing the costs of the selected rows.
   - The function correctly prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

The provided summaries and the original assessment accurately reflect the intended behavior and correctness of the functions. The logic in both functions is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of placing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work as intended and handle the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
