Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports under a single row of the river, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1.
   - For the next `d-1` elements, it adds 2 to each element (since each support costs 1 more than the depth plus 1).

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row, where each element is paired with its index.

3. **Heap Processing**:
   - For each subsequent element in the row starting from the `d`-th element, the function ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - It pops elements from the heap until the index of the smallest element is greater than `i - (d + 1)`, ensuring that the distance condition is met.
   - The cost of placing a support at the current position is calculated and added to the corresponding element in the row.
   - The current element and its cost are pushed back into the heap.

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns the last element of the row, which represents the minimum cost to place supports in the entire row.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function processes the entire input and calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges over `k` consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - It reads the dimensions of the river (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of each row (`rows`).

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**:
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of placing supports in that row (`costs`).

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - It iterates through the list of costs and calculates the sum of costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It keeps track of the minimum total cost among these sums.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the minimum total cost.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:

1. **Function `func_1`** correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row:
   - The initialization and heap processing steps should ensure that the distance condition is met.
   - The returned value should be the minimum cost for placing supports in the row.

2. **Function `func_2`** correctly calculates the minimum cost for multiple rows:
   - The cost calculation for each row should be accurate.
   - The total cost calculation for each set of `k` consecutive rows should be correct.
   - The overall minimum cost should be accurately determined.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in both functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program seems to be correct in terms of logic and implementation.

**Correctness: True**
