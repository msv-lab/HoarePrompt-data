Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The logic in the program does not account for the requirement to move chips to the closest free cell to the left to form a single block of chips.
- The program simply counts the number of zeros (free cells) after removing leading and trailing zeros. This does not ensure that all chips are moved to form a single block.
- The program fails to simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, which is a key part of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not implement the required logic to move chips to the closest free cell to the left and does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.
