Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of the length of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `res` is 1 if the element at index `i` in `a` is equal to 0. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The value of `a` does not change within the loop body as per the given postcondition, so it remains the same.
   - The value of `res` will remain unchanged unless the new element at the updated index `i` is 0. However, since no information about the new element is provided, we assume `res` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `res` remains unchanged.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `a` is a list of integers, `res` is 1 if the element at index `i+1` in `a` is equal to 0. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1.**

However, to fit the exact format requested:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `res` is 1 if the element at index `i+1` in `a` is equal to 0. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1**.
