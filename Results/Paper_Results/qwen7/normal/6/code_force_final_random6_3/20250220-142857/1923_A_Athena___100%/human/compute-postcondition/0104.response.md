Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 6 * n`. However, since `n` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`. But we know that `t` is being updated by subtracting `6 * n` from its current value.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `res` is initialized to 0.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of the variable `res`.

Output: **0**
