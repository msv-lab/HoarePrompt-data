Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1). The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case, indicating if at least one cell contains a chip.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases to process, an integer n specifying the number of elements in a list, and a list of n integers (0s and 1s) indicating the presence of chips in cells. The function checks each test case to confirm that at least one cell contains a chip and returns a result accordingly.
