Output State: **`a` is a list with its first element now being the second element of the original list, which must be 0**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element of the list `a`. According to the initial state, the first element of `a` was removed and the new first element must be 0. After executing `a.pop(0)`, the first element of `a` is now the second element of the original list, which is specified to be 0. Therefore, the first element of `a` is 0, and the rest of the list remains unchanged from the initial state except for the fact that its first element is now 0.
