Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program does not account for the actual movement of chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it simply counts the number of free cells at the end of the list after removing leading and trailing zeros. This approach fails to consider the optimal way to move chips to minimize the number of operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `1` because moving the chip in the 7th cell to the 5th cell achieves the goal in one operation. However, the program's logic does not reflect this optimal solution. It only counts the number of free cells at the end, which is not a valid measure for the minimum number of operations needed to cluster all chips together.
