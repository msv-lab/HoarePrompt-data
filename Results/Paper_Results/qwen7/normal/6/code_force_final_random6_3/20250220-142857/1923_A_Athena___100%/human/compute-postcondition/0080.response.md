Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the front of the list `a` as long as the first element is 0. Since the loop executes up to 3 times based on the given output states, it means the first 3 elements of `a` were all 0s. After these 3 iterations, `a` becomes an empty list. The value of `t` decreases by 2 for each iteration of the loop, so after `n` iterations, `t` will be `t - 2 * n`. The variable `res` remains 0 because it is not affected by the loop.
