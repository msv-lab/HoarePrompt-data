Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the code does not account for moving chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not reflect the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the left until they form a single block. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the index of the rightmost chip
        last_chip_index = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                last_chip_index = i
        
        # Count the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(last_chip_index + 1, n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                operations += (i - last_chip_index - 1)
                last_chip_index = i
        
        print(operations)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips to form a single block.
