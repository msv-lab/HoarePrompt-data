You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be reduced by 6 times the sum of all `n` values entered initially. The list `a` will be empty after all leading and trailing zeros have been removed from each `a` list during each iteration. The variable `res` will be the total count of all zeros present in all the lists `a` across all iterations.
    #
    #This means that `t` will reflect the remaining number of iterations after accounting for all the iterations performed based on the input values of `n`. The `res` variable will hold the cumulative count of zeros from all the processed lists `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n`, and a list of `n` binary values (0s and 1s). It then removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the remaining zeros. Finally, it prints the total count of zeros across all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cells `a`.

2. **Initial Cleanup:**
   - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` by popping elements from the start until a non-zero element is found.
   - It also removes trailing zeros from the list `a` by popping elements from the end until a non-zero element is found.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program iterates through the cleaned list `a` and counts the number of free cells (i.e., the number of zeros).

4. **Output:**
   - The count of free cells is printed as the result.

### Problem Statement Recap
The goal is to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. The minimum number of operations required is the number of free cells that need to be filled by moving chips to the leftmost possible positions.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations:**
   - The program simply counts the number of free cells after cleaning up the list. However, this does not account for the actual number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block.
   - For example, consider the input `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`. After cleanup, it becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the program outputs `1`. This is incorrect because we need to move the rightmost chip (originally at index 7) to the position just before the last chip (index 4), which requires 3 operations, not 1.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires moving chips to the leftmost possible positions, which may involve multiple steps. The current logic only counts the number of free cells but does not simulate the actual movements.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to account for the actual number of operations needed to move the chips to form a single block.

### Correctness
**False**
