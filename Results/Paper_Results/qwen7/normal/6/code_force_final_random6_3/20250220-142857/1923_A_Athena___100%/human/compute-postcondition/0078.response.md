Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[0] == 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as the list `a` is not empty and the first element of `a` is 0.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is `t - 2`
   - `n` is an input integer (no change needed here)
   - `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, and the first element of `a` was 0 (so the first element of `a` is now removed)
   - `res` is 0

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**:
   - The loop condition checks two things: 
     1. `a` is not empty (`a`)
     2. The first element of `a` is 0 (`a[0] == 0`)

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true.
   - Since `a` is already non-empty (it has at least one element left), we don't need to change this.
   - The first element of `a` must be 0 for the loop to continue. Since the first element was 0 and it has been removed, the new first element must be 0 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is the first element of `a` to be 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with the first element removed and the first element of `a` must be 0, `res` is 0**
