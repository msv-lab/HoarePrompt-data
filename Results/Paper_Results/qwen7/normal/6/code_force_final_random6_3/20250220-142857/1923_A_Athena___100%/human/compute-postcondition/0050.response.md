Output State: **`a` contains all elements except the last one, and the last element of `a` is no longer zero**.

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the initial state mentioned that the last element of `a` is zero, after executing the code, the last element of `a` is no longer zero (it has been removed). The other elements of `a` remain unchanged.
