Output State: **The list `a` is now one element shorter and its last element was 0; `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` remains an input integer; `res` remains 0.**

The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0, it is removed, making the list one element shorter. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
