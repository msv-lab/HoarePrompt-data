Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` now contains at least one element which is not 0 and the last element of `a` is no longer 0, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` was 0 and it is now removed, the last element of `a` is no longer 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
