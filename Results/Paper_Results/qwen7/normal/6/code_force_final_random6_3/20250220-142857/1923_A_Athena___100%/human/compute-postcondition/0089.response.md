Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (up to 3 times based on the given conditions), the list `a` will be completely emptied since it removes elements from the front as long as the first element is 0. Given that the loop runs up to 3 times, `t` will have decreased by `2 * n` (where `n` is the input integer) over these iterations. The variable `res` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop, and `a` becomes an empty list once all its elements are removed.
