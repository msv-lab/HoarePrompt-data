Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.
   - `a and a[-1] == 0` means that the list `a` should not be empty (`a`), and the last element of `a` should be zero (`a[-1] == 0`).

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - The list `a` contains no elements or its first element is non-zero.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the list `a` must not be empty (`a`), and the last element of `a` must be zero (`a[-1] == 0`).
   - Given that the current state says `a` contains no elements or its first element is non-zero, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty and its last element is zero.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `a` contains no elements, we need to add at least one element to `a` such that the last element is zero.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element and the last element of `a` is zero.

So, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element and the last element of `a` must be zero**.
