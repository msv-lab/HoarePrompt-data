Based on the initial state provided:

- `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string "YES" regardless of the values of the other variables since the print statement itself does not depend on any of these conditions.

Output: **YES**
