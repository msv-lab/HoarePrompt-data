The loop has already executed all its iterations, meaning that the variable `i` has reached the value of `t`. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, there are no more iterations left to execute.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has reached the value of `t`, and since `range(t)` generates values from 0 to `t-1`, the loop has finished executing.

Since there are no more iterations left, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to reflect that the loop cannot execute anymore.

State: **`i` is equal to `t` and the loop cannot execute anymore**
