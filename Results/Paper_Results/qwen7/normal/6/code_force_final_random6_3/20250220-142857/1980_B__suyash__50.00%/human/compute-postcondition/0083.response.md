Postcondition: `i` is equal to `t`, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`, `k` is the third element of list `b`. If `k` is equal to `n`, no changes are made to the variables.
