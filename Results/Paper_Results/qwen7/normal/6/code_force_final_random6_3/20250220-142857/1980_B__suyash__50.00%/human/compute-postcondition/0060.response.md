Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `k` is defined as `k - dic[l[2]]`. However, there are no values provided for `k`, `dic`, and `l`. Since these values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `k`.

2. The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given that the only value explicitly provided is `i = 2`, and the print statement is `print('NO')`, the output will be the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
