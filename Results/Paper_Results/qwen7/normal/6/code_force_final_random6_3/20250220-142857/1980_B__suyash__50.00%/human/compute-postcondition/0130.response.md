Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is the third element of list `b` minus `dic[l[i-1]]` minus `dic[l[i]]`, `dic` remains unchanged, and `len(l)` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `k`, `dic`, and `len(l)` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify these variables.
