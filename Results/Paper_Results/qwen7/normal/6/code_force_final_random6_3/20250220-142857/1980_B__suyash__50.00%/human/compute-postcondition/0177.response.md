Output State: **`fav` is not equal to `l[i]`; `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `k` is being decremented by the value of `dic[l[i]]`. Since the `break` statement does not change the values of `fav` or `k`, these variables retain their original conditions. Therefore, `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
