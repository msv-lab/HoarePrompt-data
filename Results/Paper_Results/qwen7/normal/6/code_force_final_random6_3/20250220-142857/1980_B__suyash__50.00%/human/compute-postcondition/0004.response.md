Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the string `a` split by spaces into integers; `o` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `o = input().split()` takes an input from the user and splits it by spaces, storing the resulting list of strings in `o`. The initial conditions for `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and `b` is updated to reflect the conversion of the elements in `a` split by spaces into integers.
