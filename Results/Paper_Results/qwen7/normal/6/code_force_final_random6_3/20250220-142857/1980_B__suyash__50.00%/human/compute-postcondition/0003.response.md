Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the string `a` split by spaces into integers.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `a` by spaces using the `split()` method and then converts each element of the resulting list into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged, and a new list `b` is created with the converted integer values.
