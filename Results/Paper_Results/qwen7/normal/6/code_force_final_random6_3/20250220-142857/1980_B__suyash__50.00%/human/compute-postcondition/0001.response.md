Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user, and it is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
