The function takes no input arguments but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, where each line contains two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are at most 100 test cases.
