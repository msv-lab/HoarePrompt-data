Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, `f` is the fourth integer entered, `g` is the first integer from input split, `h` is the second integer from input split, `n` is (a - e)² + (b - f)², `x` is (c - g)² + (d - h)²**.

In this output state, the value of `x` is updated to be the square of the difference between `c` and `g` plus the square of the difference between `d` and `h`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
