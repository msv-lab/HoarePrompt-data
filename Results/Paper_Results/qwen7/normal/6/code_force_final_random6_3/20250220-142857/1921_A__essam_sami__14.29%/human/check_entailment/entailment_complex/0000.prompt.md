Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input arguments but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, where each line contains two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are at most 100 test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is equal to `t`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, `f` is the fourth integer entered, `g` is the fifth integer entered, `h` is the sixth integer entered, `n` is the minimum value between \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\) and \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\) after all iterations, `x` is the value of \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\) from the last iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be the initial number of test cases, `steps` will be equal to `t`, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will be the most recently input integers. The variable `n` will hold the minimum value between the two distances calculated in each iteration, and `x` will hold the distance calculated in the last iteration, regardless of whether it was larger or smaller than `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates the squared distance between the diagonally opposite corners of the square and determines which of the two diagonals is shorter. For each test case, it prints the squared length of the shorter diagonal. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
