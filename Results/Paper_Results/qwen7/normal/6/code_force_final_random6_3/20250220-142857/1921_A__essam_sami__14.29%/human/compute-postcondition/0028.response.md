Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, `f` is the fourth integer entered, `g` is the first integer from input split, `h` is the second integer from input split, `n` is (a - e)Â² + (b - f)Â²**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `n` as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
