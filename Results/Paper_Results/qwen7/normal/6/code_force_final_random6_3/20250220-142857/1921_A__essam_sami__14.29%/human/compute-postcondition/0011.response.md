Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `steps` is 1 (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `a` and `b` are input integers (their specific values are not provided but they are used in the calculation of `n` and `x`).
- `c` and `d` are the first and second integers entered respectively (though they are not used in the print statement).
- `e` and `f` are the first and second integers from the input split respectively.
- `g` is the first integer from the input split converted to an integer, so `g = e`.
- `h` is the second integer from the input split converted to an integer, so `h = f`.

The expression for `n` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).

The expression for `x` is \((c - g) * (c - g) + (b - h) * (b - h)\), which simplifies to \((c - e) * (c - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\) since `g = e` and `h = f`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `x`, which is \((c - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\).

Output: **(c - e)^2 + (b - f)^2**
