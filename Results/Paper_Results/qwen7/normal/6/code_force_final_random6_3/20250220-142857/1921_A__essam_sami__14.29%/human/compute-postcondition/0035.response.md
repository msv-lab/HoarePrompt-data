Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four lines with two integers \(x_i, y_i\) per line such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\). The function checks if these coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each test case, the function does not return any value explicitly but processes the input and performs the validation.**
