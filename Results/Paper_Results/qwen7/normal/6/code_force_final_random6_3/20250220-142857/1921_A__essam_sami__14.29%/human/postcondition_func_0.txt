The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates the squared distance between the diagonally opposite corners of the square and determines which of the two diagonals is shorter. For each test case, it prints the squared length of the shorter diagonal. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
