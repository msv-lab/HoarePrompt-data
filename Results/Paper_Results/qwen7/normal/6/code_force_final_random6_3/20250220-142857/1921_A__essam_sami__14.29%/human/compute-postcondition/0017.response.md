Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 2; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered; `e` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer; `f` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer; `g` is the first integer from input split and converted to integer; `h` is the second integer from input split and converted to integer.**

The code `g, h = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `g` and `h`. The other variables remain unchanged.
