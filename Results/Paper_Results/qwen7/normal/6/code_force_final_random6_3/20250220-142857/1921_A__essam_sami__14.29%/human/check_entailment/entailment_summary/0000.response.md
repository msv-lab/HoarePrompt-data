Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the squared length of the shorter diagonal of a square, assuming that the input points represent the corners of a square. However, the logic in the program is flawed because it only considers two pairs of points at a time and does not verify that the points form a square. Specifically:

1. The program calculates the squared distances between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` and between `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`. These calculations assume that these pairs of points are diagonally opposite corners of the square, which is not necessarily true without further verification.
2. The program does not check if the four points actually form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It simply compares the squared lengths of the calculated diagonals and prints the smaller one.
3. The program does not handle all possible configurations of the four points correctly. For example, it might incorrectly identify non-parallel sides as diagonals.

Given the problem statement and the need to correctly identify the square's side length, the program should:
- Verify that the four points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- Calculate the side length of the square using the distance between adjacent corners.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement this logic, it will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
