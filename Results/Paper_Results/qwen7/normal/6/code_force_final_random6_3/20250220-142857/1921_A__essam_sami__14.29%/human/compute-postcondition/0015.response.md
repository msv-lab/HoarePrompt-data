Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `steps` is 2; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the first integer entered; `d` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `c` and `d` respectively. The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
