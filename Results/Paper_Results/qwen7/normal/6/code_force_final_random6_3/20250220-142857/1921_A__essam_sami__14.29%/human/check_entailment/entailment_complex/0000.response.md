Reasoning:
The given program attempts to find the area of a square by calculating the squared distance between the diagonally opposite corners of the square. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers two pairs of points out of the four given points for each test case, instead of considering all possible pairs to ensure that the correct diagonal is identified.

Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case by reading four pairs of coordinates.
2. **Distance Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points:
   - `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`
   - `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`
3. **Output**: The program then prints the minimum of these two distances, assuming that the shorter distance corresponds to the diagonal of the square. This is incorrect because the program does not consider all possible pairs of points to identify the correct diagonal.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the squared distances between all pairs of points and identify the maximum and minimum distances. The difference between the maximum and minimum distances should give us twice the side length of the square, and squaring this difference will give us the area of the square.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
