Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the print statement).
- `steps` is 3.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` are specific integers where `c` is the first integer entered, `d` is the second integer entered, `e` is the third integer entered, and `f` is the fourth integer entered.
- `g` is the first integer from input split, and `h` is the second integer from input split.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(n)
```

Here, `n` is the value of \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\). Since the values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not explicitly provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `n`. However, we know that `n` is computed based on these values.

Output: **(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2**
