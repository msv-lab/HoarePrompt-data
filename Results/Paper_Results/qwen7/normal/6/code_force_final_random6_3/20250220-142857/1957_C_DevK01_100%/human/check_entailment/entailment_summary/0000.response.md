Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, considering the mirroring rule. The solution should correctly handle the reduction in the number of available positions due to the rooks placed.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( k \), and the coordinates of the moves made.
   - It then adjusts \( n \) based on whether the moves were mirrored or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of configurations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute a sequence based on a specific recurrence relation.
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The base cases are \( dp[0] = 1 \) and \( dp[1] = 1 \).
   - The function returns the value of \( dp[n] \).

4. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The execution summary states that the function `func_1` always returns 1070834 for any valid input \( n \).
   - This suggests that the recurrence relation and the implementation are incorrect, as the number of configurations should depend on \( n \) and \( k \), not be a constant value.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the number of configurations based on the problem's requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
