Output State: **t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the loop has executed all its iterations.**

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is such that `t` remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The loop has processed all the test cases provided, meaning it has read through all the necessary lines in the input, including the specified number of test cases and their corresponding sequences.
