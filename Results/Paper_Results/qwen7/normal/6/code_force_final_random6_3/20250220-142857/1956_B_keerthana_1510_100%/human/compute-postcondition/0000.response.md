Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over lines read from standard input using `[*open(0)][2::2]`.
   - The variable `line` is used in the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `for line in [*open(0)][2::2]`.
   - This means the loop will iterate over every second line starting from the third line (index 2) of the input.

3. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The second line of each test case contains `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and each integer from 1 through \(n\) appears in the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) at most 2 times.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The loop will start reading lines from the input starting from the third line.
   - Therefore, the initial state should reflect that the first two lines (containing `t` and `n`) have already been read and processed, and the loop is about to start reading the third line and subsequent lines.

### Final State:

- The state before the loop starts should ensure that the first two lines have been processed and the loop is ready to start reading the third line and beyond.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (already processed).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) (already processed).
- The loop is about to start reading the third line and subsequent lines.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the loop is about to start reading the third line and subsequent lines.**
