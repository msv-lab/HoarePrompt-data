Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) such that each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given sequence.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of test instances. Each instance involves an integer t indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n indicating the length of the sequence, and then a sequence of n integers. The function processes this sequence and returns a result for each test case, ensuring that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
