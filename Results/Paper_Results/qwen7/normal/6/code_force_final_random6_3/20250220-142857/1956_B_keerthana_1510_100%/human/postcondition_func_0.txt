The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) such that each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of unique integers in the sequence, which is the length of the sequence minus the number of distinct integers in the sequence. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value.
