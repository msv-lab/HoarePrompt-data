Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

2. **Understanding `s`**:
   - `s` is constructed by repeating the string 'AAB' `n // 2` times.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`, so `s` would be 'AAB' repeated 3 times, resulting in 'AABAAB'.
   - If `n = 7`, then `n // 2 = 3`, so `s` would be 'AAB' repeated 3 times, resulting in 'AABAAB'.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement outputs the string `s`.

Given the initial state, the value of `s` depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information. However, the print statement will output the string `s` which is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times**
