Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but since `t` itself is not explicitly given a value, it remains undefined in this context. However, the value of `t` does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, which means its value is unknown but it will be used to determine the value of `s`.
- `s` is either 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is odd, or remains unchanged (which would mean `s` is still 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times) if `n` is even. This is because the problem statement does not specify a different value for `s` when `n` is even; it only specifies what happens if `n` is odd.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement will simply output the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
