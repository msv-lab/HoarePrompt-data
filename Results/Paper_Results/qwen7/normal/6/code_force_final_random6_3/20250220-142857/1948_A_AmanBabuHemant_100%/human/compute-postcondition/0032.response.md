Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is defined as `t - 1`, but since `t` itself is not explicitly defined, it's not clear what `t` initially is. However, the value of `t` does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a string 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
