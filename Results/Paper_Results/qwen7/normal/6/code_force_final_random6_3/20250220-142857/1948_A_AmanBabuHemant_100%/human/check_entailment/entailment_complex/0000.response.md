Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the function checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO', as per the problem statement.
3. If `n` is even, the function generates a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This ensures that each character in the string, except the first and last, has exactly one neighbor that is different from it, making them special characters.
4. The function then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the generated string. If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO'.
5. The function does not return anything, which is acceptable since the problem specifies printing the output directly.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
