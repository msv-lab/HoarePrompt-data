Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The initial state does not provide any specific value for `t`, but it states that `t` is assigned the value of `t - 1`. Since no initial value for `t` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `t` from this information alone. However, this assignment does not affect the `print` statement.
- The variable `n` is defined as an input integer.
- The string `s` is defined as 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. Again, since the value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact content of `s`.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Given the information provided, the only thing that is explicitly printed is the string 'NO'.
