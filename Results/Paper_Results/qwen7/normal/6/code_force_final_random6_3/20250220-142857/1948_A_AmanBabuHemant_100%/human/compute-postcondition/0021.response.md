Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 49, `n` is an input integer, `s` is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. The division operation `n // 2` results in an integer value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
