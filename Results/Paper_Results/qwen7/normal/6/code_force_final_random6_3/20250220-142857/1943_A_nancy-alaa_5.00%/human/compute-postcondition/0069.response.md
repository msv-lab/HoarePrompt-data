Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `first` is a boolean.
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.

4. **Consider the loop body behavior**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, the loop will break.
   - If `mpp[i]` does not equal 1 or `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the loop will also break.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the only change needed is to increment `i` by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop body.
   - `first` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, we assume it stays the same.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `first` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer (i+1), `n` is an integer greater than 0**
