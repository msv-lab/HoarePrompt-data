Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then checks for the smallest integer \( i \) that either does not appear in the list \( a \) or appears exactly once after the first occurrence. If such an integer \( i \) is found, it is printed; otherwise, no output is generated.**
