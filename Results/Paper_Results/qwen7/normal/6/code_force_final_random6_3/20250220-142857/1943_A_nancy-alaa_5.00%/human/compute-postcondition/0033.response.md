Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is either 1 or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`, and `n` must still be greater than 0. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, `i` is updated to the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` and `n` is decremented by 1. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is not True, `first` remains False, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.
