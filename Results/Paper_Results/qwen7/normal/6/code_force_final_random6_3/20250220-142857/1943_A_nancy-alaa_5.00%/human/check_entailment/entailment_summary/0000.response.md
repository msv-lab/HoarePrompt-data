Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX of the array \( c \) formed during the game.
2. The provided solution attempts to find the smallest integer \( i \) that either does not appear in the list \( a \) or appears exactly once after the first occurrence. However, this approach does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.
3. Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice tries to maximize the MEX, and Bob tries to minimize it. The solution does not account for the alternating turns and the specific rules of the game.
4. The solution only considers the first occurrence of each number and does not simulate the game's turns correctly. It fails to handle the different strategies of Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players.
