Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is either 1 or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`, and `n` must still be greater than 0. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is not True, nothing changes regarding the values of `first`, `i`, and `n`.
