Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in the array `c`. However, there are several issues with the logic implemented in the program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice and Bob's Moves**: The program does not simulate the game correctly. Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`. The current implementation does not account for these rules.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program tries to find the MEX directly from the input array `arr` without simulating the game. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal moves of both players.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The program checks for the presence of numbers in `arr` and prints the first missing number, but it does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. The program also does not handle the case where the MEX is greater than `n`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
