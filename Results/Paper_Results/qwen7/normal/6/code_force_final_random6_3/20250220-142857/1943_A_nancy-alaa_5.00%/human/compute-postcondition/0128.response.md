Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
