Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `i + 1`. This means that `i` is being assigned a value that is one more than its current value. However, since the exact initial value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the precise value of `i` after this operation.
- `n` is an integer equal to the input integer. This means `n` holds the value of the input integer.

Given the `print(i)` statement, we need to describe what will be printed based on the provided information.

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not specified, we can only say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its original value. Therefore, the output will depend on the original value of `i`.

Output: **i + 1 (where i is the original value of i before it was incremented by 1)**
