Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 (`i + 1`), `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, and if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` or if `mpp[i] != 1` and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i] == 1`, the loop or if statement continues without further changes to `i` and `n`.
