Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(n)`.
   - This means `i` should be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `first` is `False`.
   - `i` is either `1` or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `0`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was either `1` or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1`, and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `i` will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2` (if it was `1` before) or the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` plus `1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than `0`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `first` remains `False` unless the condition `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True` is met, but since we are only considering the start of the next iteration, `first` remains `False`.
   - `i` is incremented by `1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`first` is False, `i` is the next key in `mpp` where `mpp[key] == 1` or 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0**.
