Output State: **`first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer equal to `n`, `n` is an integer equal to the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`**.

The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` that contains the count of each element in the list `arr`. The values of `first`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
