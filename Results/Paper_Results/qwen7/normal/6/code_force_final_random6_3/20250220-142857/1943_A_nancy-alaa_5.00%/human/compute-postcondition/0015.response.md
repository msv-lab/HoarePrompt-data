Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, no changes are made to `i` and `first` remains as is, and if `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, since there is no loop or switch statement affecting the variables `first`, `i`, `n`, and `mpp`, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the postcondition also remain valid.
