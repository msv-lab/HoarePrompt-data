Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` are as specified in the postcondition.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains equal to `n`.
   - Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on the previous iteration's outcome:
     - If `a[i]` was equal to `tmp`, `ans` remains `n`.
     - Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)`, where `cnt` is either 0 or incremented by 1 depending on the condition.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ans` will be updated based on the previous iteration's outcome.

Since we don't know the exact values of `cnt`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` from the previous iteration, we can express the state in a general form:

State: **`cnt` is unknown but will be updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `a` is the same, `tmp` is the same, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)` if `a[i]` did not equal `tmp`, otherwise `ans` remains `n`**.

However, for clarity and to match the required format, we can represent it as:

State: **`cnt` is unknown but will be updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `a` is the same, `tmp` is the same, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)` if `a[i]` did not equal `tmp`, otherwise `ans` remains `n`**.

To fit the exact format requested:

State: **`cnt` is unknown but will be updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `a` is the same, `tmp` is the same, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)` if `a[i]` did not equal `tmp`, otherwise `ans` remains `n`**.
