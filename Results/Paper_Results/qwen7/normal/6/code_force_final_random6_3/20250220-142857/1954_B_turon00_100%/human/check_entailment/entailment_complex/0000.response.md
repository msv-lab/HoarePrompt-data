Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
2. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution iterates through the array and counts the maximum length of consecutive identical elements.
4. If the entire array consists of the same element (i.e., `n == 1` or the maximum count of consecutive identical elements equals `n`), it outputs `-1` because removing any element won't change the fact that the array is still beautiful.
5. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the longest sequence of identical elements, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty of the array.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the code, the solution correctly identifies whether the array is already beautiful (and thus cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements) and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array when applicable.

Correctness: **True**
