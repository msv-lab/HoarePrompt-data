Output State: **`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i`, `n`, the first element of `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
