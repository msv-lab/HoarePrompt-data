Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. Since no specific input value is given, `n` is described as "an input integer." All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case means they are not mentioned as they were not affected by the code.
