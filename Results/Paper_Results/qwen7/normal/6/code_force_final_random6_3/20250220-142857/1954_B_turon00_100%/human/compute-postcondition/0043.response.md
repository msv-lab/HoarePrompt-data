Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input; `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `_` is incremented by 1, but since `_` was not defined before, its exact value is not specified. However, the fact that it has been incremented by 1 is noted. All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
