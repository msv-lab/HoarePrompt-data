Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variables will be in the following state:
- `cnt` will be 0 because every time `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, `cnt` is reset to 0, and the loop continues until all elements in `a` are checked.
- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, and after the last iteration, `i` will be incremented to `n`.
- `n` will remain the same as the initial input integer.
- `a` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `tmp` will remain the same as the initial first element of the list `a`.
- `ans` will be the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` for each iteration where `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, and since `cnt` is reset to 0 whenever `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `ans` will essentially be the maximum consecutive count of non-matching elements in the list `a`.

In summary, `ans` will hold the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements in `a` that are not equal to `tmp`.
