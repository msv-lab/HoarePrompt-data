Output State: **`ans` is updated to `min(ans, cnt)`, `cnt` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `a` is the same, `tmp` is the same.**

This means that the value of `ans` is now the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. The value of `cnt` has been updated based on the previous iteration. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their previous states.
