Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.
