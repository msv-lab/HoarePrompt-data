Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. All other variables remain in their initial state.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4, while `n` and the array `a` remain undefined and unchanged from their initial state.
