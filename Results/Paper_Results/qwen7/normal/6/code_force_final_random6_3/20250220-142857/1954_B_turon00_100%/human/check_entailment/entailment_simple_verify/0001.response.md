### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0. `ans` is initialized to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. If it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
   - If the array has only one element or `ans` equals `n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` and updating `ans` when encountering a different element seems correct.
   - However, the program does not fully address the requirement to ensure the array stops being beautiful. The current logic only counts consecutive elements but does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program does not implement the actual removal of elements and check if the array becomes non-beautiful after removals.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points, indicating that the program only counts consecutive elements and does not simulate the removal of elements to check if the array becomes non-beautiful.
   - The final state shows that the program does not perform the necessary checks to ensure the array stops being beautiful after removals.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It only counts consecutive elements and does not simulate the removal of elements to check if the array becomes non-beautiful.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts consecutive elements without simulating the removal of elements to check if the array becomes non-beautiful. The program needs to implement a mechanism to remove elements and verify if the array stops being beautiful after each removal.
