Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value (which is unknown but was the minimum of itself and `cnt`) and the new value of `cnt`, which is 0.
