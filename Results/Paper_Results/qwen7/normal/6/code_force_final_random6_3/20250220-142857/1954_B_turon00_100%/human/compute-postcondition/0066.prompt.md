Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, `_` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is reset to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list (i + 1), `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`. `ans` is always the minimum value between itself and `cnt` after the if-else block executes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i + 2` is valid, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i + 1` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`. `ans` is the minimum value between itself and `cnt` after the if-else block executes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
