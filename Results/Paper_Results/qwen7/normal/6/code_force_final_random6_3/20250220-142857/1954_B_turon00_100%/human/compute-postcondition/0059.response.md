Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the list (`i + 1`).
   - `tmp` is an integer.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `ans` is always the minimum value between itself and `cnt` after the if-else block executes.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index within the list such that `i + 1` is valid.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The other variables (`a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i + 2` is valid, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i + 1` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`. `ans` is always the minimum value between itself and `cnt` after the if-else block executes.**
