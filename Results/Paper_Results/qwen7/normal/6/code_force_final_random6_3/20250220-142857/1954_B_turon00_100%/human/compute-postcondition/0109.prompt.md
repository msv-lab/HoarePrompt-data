Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. All other variables remain in their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (which was `n`) and `cnt`, which is 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `n` remains the same as the initial input; `a` remains the same as the initial input list of integers; `tmp` remains the same as the first element of the list `a`; `cnt` is 0; either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop completes, `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, `cnt` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains the same list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The condition `n == 1 or ans == n` is true in the if part, and either `n` is not equal to 1 or `ans` is not equal to `n` in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, which is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` retains its original value, and `n` retains its original value. If `n == 1` or `ans == n`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
