Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `i`, or `N`. It simply indicates that if there were such a loop or conditional block, execution would terminate immediately. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, and `N` remain unchanged, and the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
