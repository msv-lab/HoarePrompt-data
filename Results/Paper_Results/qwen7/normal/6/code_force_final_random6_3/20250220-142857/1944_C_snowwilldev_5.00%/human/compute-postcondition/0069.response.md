Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 5.
- `i` is defined as `7 + N`, where `N` is an undefined variable. Since `N` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it will be added to 7.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. This list is not explicitly defined, so we do not know its contents.
- `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0. The specific key `i` (which is `7 + N`) does not have a value of 1 in this state.

The print statement is `print(i)`. Given that `i` is `7 + N` and `N` is an undefined variable, the exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing `N`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **7 + N**
