Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and determines if there is an integer that appears exactly once. If such an integer is found, it prints the index of the first occurrence and breaks out of the loop. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
