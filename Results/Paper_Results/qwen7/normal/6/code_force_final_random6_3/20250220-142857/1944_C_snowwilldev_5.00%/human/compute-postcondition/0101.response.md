Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt[i]` is either 0 or still equal to 1.
- `t` is increased by 1.

The print statement is `print(i)`.

Given the information, the value of `i` is not explicitly defined or constrained by the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine a specific value for `i`. The print statement will simply output the value of `i`.

Output: **i**
