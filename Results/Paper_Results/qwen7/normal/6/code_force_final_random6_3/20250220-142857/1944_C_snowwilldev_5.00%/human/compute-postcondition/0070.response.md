Output State: **`t` is 5, `i` is 7 + N, there is no change in `a` and `cnt`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is not inside any loop or conditional block, it simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
