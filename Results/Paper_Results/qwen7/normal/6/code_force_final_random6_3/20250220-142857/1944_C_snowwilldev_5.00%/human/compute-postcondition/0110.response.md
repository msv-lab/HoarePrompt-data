Output State: **`cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1, and `t` is increased by 1, making it `t + 1`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match statement context provided, the only effect is that the execution is terminated at that point. The values of `cnt[i]` remain unchanged (either 0 or 1) and `t` is increased by 1, making it `t + 1`.
