Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob playing optimally. Instead, it simply counts occurrences of each number in the array `a` and prints the first number that appears exactly once or when two such numbers have been found. This does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The optimal strategy involves Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it. The current implementation does not account for these strategic aspects.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The example provided in the problem shows that the output should be based on the optimal moves of both players, not just counting occurrences. The given solution does not produce the correct MEX value for the given examples.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob make their optimal moves. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

```python
def find_mex(c):
    mex = 0
    while mex in c:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def optimal_game_score():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's turn: pick elements to form the array c
        c = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] < n // 2:
                c.add(a[i])
            else:
                # If the element is greater than or equal to n//2, it will be picked by Bob
                pass
        
        # Bob's turn: pick elements to form the array c
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] >= n // 2:
                c.add(a[i])
        
        # Calculate the MEX of the final array c
        mex = find_mex(c)
        results.append(mex)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

optimal_game_score()
```

This code simulates the game more accurately by considering the optimal moves for both players and calculating the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
