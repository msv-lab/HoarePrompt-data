Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `N`.

2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - `N` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value int.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will run for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `N-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 1 because the range function will generate values from 0 to `N-1`.
   - The variable `i` will take on values starting from 0 up to `N-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `N` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it should start from 0).

State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
