Postcondition: `t` is 4, `i` is 6 + N, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, and if `cnt[i]` equals 0, then `cnt[i]` remains 0; otherwise, `cnt[i]` remains 1.
