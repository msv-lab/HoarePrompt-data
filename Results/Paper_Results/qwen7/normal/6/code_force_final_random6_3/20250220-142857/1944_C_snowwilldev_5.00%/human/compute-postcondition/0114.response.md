Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `N` is `N`, `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1, `t` is 1.**

The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially 0 (implied from the initial state), after executing this line, `t` becomes 1. The values of `i`, `N`, and `cnt[i]` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
