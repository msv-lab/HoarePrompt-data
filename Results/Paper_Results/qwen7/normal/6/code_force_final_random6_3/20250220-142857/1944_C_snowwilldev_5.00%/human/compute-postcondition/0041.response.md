Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 6, `N` is greater than 3, `N` is an input integer**

The code `N = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `N`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition that `N` is greater than 3 is preserved, but now `N` also holds the value of the user's input converted to an integer.
