Output State: **`input_value` is an integer, `word` is a string based on the value of `input_value`, `i` is `input_value` + 1, `n` is `input_value`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes the input value, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` being an integer based on the input value is now explicitly stated. The other variables (`input_value`, `word`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
