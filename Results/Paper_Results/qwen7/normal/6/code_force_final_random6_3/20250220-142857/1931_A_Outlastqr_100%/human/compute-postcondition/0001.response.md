Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `alphabet` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

For the loop to execute, the input to `int(input())` must be a valid integer that determines the number of iterations. Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will run for `int(input())` times. Therefore, `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Since `t` and `n` are not directly involved in determining the number of iterations of the loop, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, we should ensure that the input to `int(input())` is within a reasonable range to avoid potential issues (though the problem constraints already ensure this).

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that the input to `int(input())` is a positive integer.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\), and the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**
