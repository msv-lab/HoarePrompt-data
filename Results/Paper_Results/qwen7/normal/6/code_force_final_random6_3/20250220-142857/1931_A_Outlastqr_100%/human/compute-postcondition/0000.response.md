Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

Explanation: The code `alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase` assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` to the variable `alphabet`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `n`, while adding the new assignment for `alphabet`.
