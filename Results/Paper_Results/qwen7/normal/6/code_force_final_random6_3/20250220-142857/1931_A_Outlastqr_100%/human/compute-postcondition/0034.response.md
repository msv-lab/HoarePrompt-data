Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `input_value` is an integer.
   - `word` is either "zz", "aay", or "aaa".
   - `i` is `input_value` + 1.
   - `n` is `input_value`.
   - If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` remains "zz".
   - If `n` is not greater than 52, then `word` is set to "aay" if `n` equals 27, otherwise it is set to "aaa".

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(int(input()))`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Determining the New Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `input_value` + 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `input_value` + 2.
   - Therefore, `n` will still be `input_value` (since `n` does not change within the loop).

5. **Checking the Conditions for `word`:**
   - Since `n` remains `input_value`, we need to check the conditions based on `input_value`:
     - If `input_value` > 52, `word` remains "zz".
     - If `input_value` <= 52, `word` is "aay" if `input_value` == 27, otherwise it is "aaa".

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `input_value` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `input_value` + 2.
   - `n` remains `input_value`.
   - `word` remains "zz" if `input_value` > 52, "aay" if `input_value` == 27, otherwise "aaa".

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`input_value` is an integer, `word` is either "zz", "aay", or "aaa", `i` is `input_value` + 2, `n` is `input_value`. If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` remains "zz". If `n` is not greater than 52, then `word` is set to "aay" if `n` equals 27, otherwise it is set to "aaa"**.
