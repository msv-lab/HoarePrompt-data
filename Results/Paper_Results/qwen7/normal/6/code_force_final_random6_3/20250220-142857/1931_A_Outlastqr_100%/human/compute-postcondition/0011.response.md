Output State: **`n` is an input integer less than or equal to 27, `word` is 'aay', and `n` is 27.**

The code assigns the string `'aay'` to the variable `word`. Since the initial value of `n` is specified as 27 and it is an input integer less than or equal to 27, `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated value of `word` and the unchanged value of `n`.
