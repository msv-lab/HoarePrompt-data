You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases and integers `n`. For each test case, it constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n` and prints it. The possible outputs for `word` are 'zz', 'az', 'aay', or 'aaa'. The function does not return any value but prints the constructed strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program imports the `string` module to get the list of lowercase Latin letters.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which is the encoded value.

2. **Encoding Logic:**
   - If `n > 52`, the word must start with the character at position `n - 53` (since `a` is at position 1 and `z` is at position 26).
     - This means the first character is `alphabet[n - 53]`.
     - The remaining two characters are both `z`.
   - If `27 < n <= 52`, the word must start with `a` and the second character is `alphabet[n - 28]`.
     - This means the first character is `a`.
     - The second character is `alphabet[n - 28]`.
     - The third character is `z`.
   - If `n == 27`, the word is explicitly set to `"aay"`.
   - If `n <= 26`, the word must start with `aa` and the third character is `alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This means the first two characters are `aa`.
     - The third character is `alphabet[n - 3]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The constructed word is printed for each test case.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the logic against the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 24`**
  - According to the logic, since `27 > 24 > 26`, it should be `aa + alphabet[24 - 3] = aa + t = aat`.
  - However, the expected output is `aav`. This suggests an error in the logic.

- **Test Case 2: `n = 70`**
  - Since `70 > 52`, it should be `alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz' = w + zz = wzz`.
  - The expected output is `rzz`. This suggests an error in the logic.

- **Test Case 3: `n = 3`**
  - Since `3 <= 26`, it should be `aa + alphabet[3 - 3] = aa + a = aaa`.
  - The expected output is `aaa`. This matches the logic.

- **Test Case 4: `n = 55`**
  - Since `55 > 52`, it should be `alphabet[55 - 53] + 'zz' = b + zz = bzz`.
  - The expected output is `czz`. This suggests an error in the logic.

- **Test Case 5: `n = 48`**
  - Since `48 > 52`, it should be `alphabet[48 - 53] + 'zz' = v + zz = vzz`.
  - The expected output is `auz`. This suggests an error in the logic.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly for `n = 24`, `n = 55`, and `n = 48`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
