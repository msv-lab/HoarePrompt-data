Postcondition: `input_value` is an integer, `word` is either 'zz', 'az', 'aay', or 'aaa', `i` is `input_value` + 2, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 (exclusive) and 52 (inclusive), `word` is 'az'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is 'aaa'.
