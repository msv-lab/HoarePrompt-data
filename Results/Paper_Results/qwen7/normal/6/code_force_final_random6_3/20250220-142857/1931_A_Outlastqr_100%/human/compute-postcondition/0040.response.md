Output State: **`input_value` is an integer, `word` is 'aaa', `i` is `input_value` + 2, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code appends `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the string `word`. Since `word` was initially an empty string (`''`), it becomes `'aaa'` after the operation. The values of `i`, `input_value`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
