Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `r` is 1, `l` is 3**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` is defined as `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `over_sum` now holds the same value. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `r`, `l`) remain unchanged.
