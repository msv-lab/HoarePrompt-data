Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `lst`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes 3.
   - `sm` remains unchanged.
   - `over_sum` equals `sm`.
   - `r` is 1.
   - `l` is 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` starting from `i + 1` (which is 2) up to `len(lst)`.

4. **Check the current value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.

5. **Determine if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`.
   - Since `j` is currently 3, the loop will continue as long as `len(lst)` is greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `sm` remains unchanged.
   - `over_sum` remains equal to `sm`.
   - `r` remains 1.
   - `l` remains 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` remains unchanged, `over_sum` equals `sm`, `r` is 1, `l` is 3**
