### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues in the provided code and validate why the assessment is correct.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Issue:** The function is supposed to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum by calculating the sum of the excluded elements plus a quadratic term based on the distance between indices. However, the implementation is flawed:
  - The sum calculation is incorrect because it uses `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, which does not correctly represent the sum of the subarray after modification.
  - The MEX calculation is missing entirely, so the function does not actually find the optimal subarray.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Issue:** This function is intended to recursively generate operations, but it is not used in the main logic to solve the problem. The function simply appends operations to a list without any meaningful logic.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`):
- **Issue:** This function is intended to apply the operations and update the array, but it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. Specifically:
  - It sets the subarray to a value that is not the MEX of the subarray.
  - The recursive call to `func_2` is unnecessary and incorrect.

#### Main Logic:
- **Issue:** The main logic relies on `func_1` to find the optimal subarray, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the entire approach fails to maximize the sum of the array correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The functions do not accurately calculate the MEX or the sum of the subarray, and the overall logic is flawed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

This conclusion is based on the detailed analysis of the code and the identified issues.
