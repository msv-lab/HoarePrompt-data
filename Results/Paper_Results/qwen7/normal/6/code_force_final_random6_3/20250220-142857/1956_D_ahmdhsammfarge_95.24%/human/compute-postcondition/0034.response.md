Output State: **`i` remains 1, `j` becomes 3, `sm` remains unchanged, `over_sum` equals `sm`, `r` is 1, `l` is 3**.

The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` remains unchanged, `over_sum` now holds the same value as `sm`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `r`, and `l`) remain unaffected by this assignment.
