Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `over_sum` equals `sm`, `r` is 1, `l` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by calculating the sum of elements from the list `lst` excluding the element at index `i` and the element at index `j`, plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus one. Given the initial values of `i` (1) and `j` (4), the expression `sm = lst[0] + lst[2] + 9` is derived because the elements at indices 0 and 2 are included, and the square of the difference `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is `9`. The other variables remain unchanged.
