Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2 or more, `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is 1, `l` is 2 or more.**

The code assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Since `sm` was already defined and had a specific value, `over_sum` now holds the same value as `sm`. All other variables remain unchanged.
