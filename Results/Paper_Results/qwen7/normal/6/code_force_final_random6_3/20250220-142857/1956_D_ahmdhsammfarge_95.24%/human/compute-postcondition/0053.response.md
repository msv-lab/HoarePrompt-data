Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is greater than 4, `r` is 2, `l` is 3, `over_sum` is `lst[0] + lst[2] + 9`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:2]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1), `r` and `l` are swapped to `[i, j]` which means `r` is now 2 and `l` is now 4.**

Explanation: The line `r, l = [i, j]` swaps the values of `r` and `l`. Initially, `r` is 2 and `l` is 3. After the assignment, `r` takes the value of `i` (which is 2) and `l` takes the value of `j` (which is greater than 4). Since `j` was originally greater than 4, after swapping, `r` remains 2 and `l` becomes the original value of `j`. Therefore, `l` is now 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
