The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r` and `l`, which are integers within specified ranges, and `ops`, a list for storing operations. If `r` equals `l`, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and terminates. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with `l` decremented by 1 each time, and appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list after the recursive calls. The function does not return any value.
