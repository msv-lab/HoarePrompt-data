Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2 or more, `len(lst)` is the length of the list `lst`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1), and `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` is 1, `l` is 2 or more.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `i` to `r` and `j` to `l`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2 or more, `r` will be 1 and `l` will be 2 or more. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
