Postcondition: `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `t` is the next line of input, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`. If the last character of `t` is 'L', then `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l`. Otherwise, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1`.
