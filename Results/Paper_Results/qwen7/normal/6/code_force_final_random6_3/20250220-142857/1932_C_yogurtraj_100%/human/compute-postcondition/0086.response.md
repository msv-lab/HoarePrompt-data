Output State: **`i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`, `n` is greater than 2, `q1` and `q2` are updated accordingly, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` if `t[i] != 'R'`, and `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.**

This means that the value of `y[i]` is now equal to the current value of `k`. The values of `i`, `n`, `q1`, `q2`, `k`, `a[q1]`, `a[q2]`, `t[i]`, and `m` remain as described in the precondition, with `i` being either `n - 3` or `n - 4`, and `n` being greater than 2. The updates to `k` based on the condition `t[i]` also remain unchanged.
