Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 2, and if `t[i]` is 'R', then `q2` is increased by 1 and `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1; `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.**

Explanation: The code `y[i] = k` assigns the current value of `k` to `y[i]`. Since `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is greater than 2, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The conditions for updating `q2`, `k`, and `q1` also remain the same as they were not affected by the assignment operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `y[i]` which is `k`.
