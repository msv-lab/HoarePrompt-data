Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `t` is the next line of input.**

Explanation: The code `t = input()` assigns the value of the next line of input to the variable `t`. The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
