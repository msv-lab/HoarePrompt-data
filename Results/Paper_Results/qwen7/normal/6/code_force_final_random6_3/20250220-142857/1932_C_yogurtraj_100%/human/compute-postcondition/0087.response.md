Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` in reverse order. This means `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`.

4. **Determine the New Value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i` will be `i - 1` (from `n - 3` or `n - 4` to `n - 4` or `n - 5`).
   - `n` remains greater than 2.

6. **Consider the Update Conditions**:
   - `k` is updated based on the value of `t[i]` and the values of `a[q1]` and `a[q2]`.
   - `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.

Since the update conditions (`q1`, `q2`, `k`, and `y[i]`) are not directly affected by the loop head variables `i` and `n`, they remain unchanged for the purpose of adjusting the loop head states.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are only `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 5`, `n` is greater than 2, `q1` and `q2` are updated accordingly, `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m` if `t[i] != 'R'`, and `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.**
