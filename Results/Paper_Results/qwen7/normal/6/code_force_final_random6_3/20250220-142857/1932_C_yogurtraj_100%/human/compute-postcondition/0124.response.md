Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than 2, and the element at index `i` in the list `t` is not 'R', `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`.**

Explanation: The code `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. Since the initial state of `q1` was such that `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, the value of `k` remains unchanged because the operation only affects `q1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and the condition about the element in list `t`) remain unaffected.
