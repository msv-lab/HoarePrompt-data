Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 2, -1, -1)`. This means `i` will take values from `n-2` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = n - 2`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i >= 0`. Therefore, `n - 2` should be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ii` is already set to 0, but since the loop starts with `i = n - 2`, we need to ensure `n - 2` is valid.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 because `n - 2` must be non-negative.
   - The other variables (`m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, `y`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `ii` is not relevant to the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for `ii`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
