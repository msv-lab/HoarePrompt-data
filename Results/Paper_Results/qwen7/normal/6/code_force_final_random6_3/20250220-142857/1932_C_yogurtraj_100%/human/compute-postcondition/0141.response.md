Postcondition: `i` is either `n-6` or `n-7`, `k` is updated as `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, and `k` is updated as `k * a[q1] % m` otherwise. `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k` (either `k * a[q2] % m` or `k * a[q1] % m`). Additionally, if `t[i] == 'R'`, `q2` is incremented by 1, and if `t[i] != 'R'`, `q1` is decreased by 1.
