Output State: **`k` is updated to the value of `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and the current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `q2` by 1. The values of `k`, `a[q2]`, `m`, `n`, and `t[i]` remain as they were in the initial state, except for `q2` which is now one more than its previous value.
