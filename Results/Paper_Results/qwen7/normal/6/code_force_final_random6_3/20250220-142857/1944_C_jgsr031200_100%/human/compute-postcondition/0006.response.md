Output State: **`freq[i]` is increased by 3, `i` is the next element in `arr`**

Explanation: The code `freq[i] += 1` increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. Since it was already increased by 2 in the initial state, the new value of `freq[i]` is increased by 3. The value of `i` remains the next element in `arr`, as the code does not affect its value.
