Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `freq[i]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `arr`, the variable `i` changes with each iteration. The variable `arr` itself does not change within the loop (it remains the same list).
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was set to the current element being processed, and `freq[i]` was incremented.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next element in `arr`.
   - The value of `freq[i]` will be incremented again when the loop body runs for the next element.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `i` will be set to the next element in `arr`.
   - The variable `freq[i]` will be incremented in the next iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`freq[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is the next element in `arr`**
