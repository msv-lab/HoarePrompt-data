You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and calculates the frequency of each integer in the list. It then iterates through these frequencies, printing the first integer that appears exactly once or not at all, and stops after finding two such integers. If no such integers are found, it prints nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game between Alice and Bob.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Alice picks one element from `a` and appends it to `c`, then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob picks one element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX of `c`.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX.

### Code Analysis

The provided code seems to have some irrelevant functions commented out and an incomplete function `func_1`. Let's focus on the relevant part:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Frequency Array**:
   - `freq` is initialized to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

2. **Counting Single Occurrences**:
   - The loop counts how many elements appear exactly once (`cou`).

3. **Determine MEX**:
   - If there are at least two unique elements in `arr`, the MEX will be `2`.
   - If there is only one unique element, the MEX will be `1`.
   - If no unique elements exist, the MEX will be `0`.

### Issues in the Code

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The code does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the different strategies of Alice and Bob.
   - It simply counts the frequency of elements and prints the first element that appears either once or zero times.

2. **Missing Game Logic**:
   - The code does not implement the alternating turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It does not ensure that Alice maximizes and Bob minimizes the MEX.

### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice will pick the smallest available element that hasn't been picked before.
   - Bob will pick the largest available element that hasn't been picked before.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - After simulating the game, calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def find_mex(c):
    mex = 0
    seen = set(c)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

def optimal_game_score(n, arr):
    c = []
    a = sorted(set(arr))
    
    alice_turn = True
    for _ in range(n):
        if alice_turn:
            # Alice picks the smallest available element
            c.append(a.pop(0))
        else:
            # Bob picks the largest available element
            c.append(a.pop())
        alice_turn = not alice_turn
    
    return find_mex(c)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(optimal_game_score(n, arr))
```

### Conclusion

The provided code is **incorrect** because it does not simulate the game correctly and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
