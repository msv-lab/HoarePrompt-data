Output State: **`cou` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop continues as long as `freq[i]` is not greater than or equal to 2. If `freq[i]` equals 1, both `cou` and `i` are updated accordingly; otherwise, the values of `cou` and `i` remain unchanged. We break out of the loop.**

This means that the loop has been broken, but the conditions for updating `cou` and `i` remain the same as before the break.
