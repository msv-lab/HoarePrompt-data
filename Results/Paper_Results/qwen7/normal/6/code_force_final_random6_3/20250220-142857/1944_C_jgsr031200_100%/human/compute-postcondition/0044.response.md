Based on the initial state described:

- `cou` remains 0, meaning it was not incremented.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- The loop continues as long as `freq[i]` is not greater than or equal to 2.
- Once `freq[i]` is at least 2, the loop stops.

This means that the loop will continue incrementing `i` until `freq[i]` reaches a value of 2 or more. Since `cou` remains 0, it indicates that `freq[i]` never reached 1 during the loop, implying that `freq[i]` must have been 2 or more when the loop exited.

Therefore, `i` is the last value of `i` that caused the loop to exit, which means `freq[i]` was at least 2.

Output: **i (where i is the last value such that freq[i] is at least 2)**
