### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it to the problem description and the expected behavior.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a` and appending it to her array `c`, then deleting it from `a`.
- Bob picks an element from `a` and deletes it without adding it to `c`.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, with Alice maximizing the MEX and Bob minimizing it.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - Initializes a frequency list `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - Iterates through `arr` and increments the corresponding frequency in `freq`.
   - Iterates through `freq` to find the first integer that appears exactly once or not at all, and prints it.
   - Stops after finding two such integers.

2. **Key Issues**:
   - The function does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns optimally.
   - It simply counts the frequency of elements and prints the first integer that meets certain criteria, which is not relevant to the game logic.
   - There is no simulation of turns, no consideration of who picks which element, and no calculation of the MEX based on the optimal moves of both players.

3. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     Input:
     3
     4
     0 0 1 1
     4
     0 1 2 3
     2
     1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     1
     0
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     0
     0
     0
     ```
   - The output is incorrect because the program does not simulate the game logic. For instance, in the first test case, the optimal play would result in `c = [1, 0]`, giving a MEX of 2, but the program incorrectly prints 0.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. It fails to simulate the turns and the optimal strategies of both players, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game logic where Alice and Bob make optimal moves to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.
