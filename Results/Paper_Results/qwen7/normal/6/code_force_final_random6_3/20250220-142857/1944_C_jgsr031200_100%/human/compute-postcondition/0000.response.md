Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\); `freq` is a list of zeros with length \(n + 1**.

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `freq` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `arr` or any other variables. Therefore, the initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, and `freq` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
