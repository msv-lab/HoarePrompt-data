Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires simulating the game between Alice and Bob and determining the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
2. The annotated code includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) which are irrelevant to the problem at hand.
3. The `func_1` function is attempting to count the frequency of each number in the input array `arr`, but this is not relevant to the game simulation.
4. The logic within `func_1` does not simulate the game or determine the MEX of the array `c` as required by the problem statement.
5. The problem requires understanding the optimal moves for both players, which involves strategic placement of numbers in `c` to achieve the desired MEX value. The current implementation does not account for these strategic placements.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
