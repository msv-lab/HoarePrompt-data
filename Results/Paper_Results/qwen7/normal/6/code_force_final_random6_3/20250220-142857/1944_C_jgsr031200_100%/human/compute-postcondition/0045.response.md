Output State: **`cou` remains 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop when the condition `freq[i]` is at least 2. Since the loop was continuing as long as `freq[i]` was not greater than or equal to 2, once this condition is no longer met, the `break` statement is executed, causing the loop to terminate. The values of `cou` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
