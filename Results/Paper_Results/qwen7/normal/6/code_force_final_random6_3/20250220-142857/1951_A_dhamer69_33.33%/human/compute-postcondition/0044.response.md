Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. If the string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11', the program does not change these values. Otherwise, the program also does not change these values.**
