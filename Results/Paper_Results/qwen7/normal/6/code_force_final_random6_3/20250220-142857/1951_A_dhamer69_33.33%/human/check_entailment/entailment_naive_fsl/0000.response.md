Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program `func` does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` which is supposed to generate `.ac.py` and `.wa.py` files for each `.html` file in folders whose names are within a specified range. However, the given program `func` is a completely different function that checks for certain patterns in a string and prints 'YES' or 'NO'. It does not contain any logic related to generating files or handling folders and their contents as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements and is incorrect.
