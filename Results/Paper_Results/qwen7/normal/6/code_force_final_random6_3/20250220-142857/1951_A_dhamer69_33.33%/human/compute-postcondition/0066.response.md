Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.

After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be reduced to 0 since it starts from a positive value and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n` and `s` will be determined by the last inputs provided during the loop's execution, and `count_1` will be the number of '1's in the string `s` corresponding to the last input.
