Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Provided Problem Description:
The problem seems to be about processing a range of directories (from `start_range` to `end_range`) where each directory name is a digit. For each directory containing `.html` files, it should generate two empty files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file.

### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is defined correctly to take two parameters: `start` and `end`.

2. **Directory Scanning**:
   - The current working directory is obtained using `os.getcwd()`.
   - Subdirectories are listed using `os.scandir()` and filtered to include only those that are directories.
   
3. **Folder Name Validation**:
   - Each subdirectory's name is checked to ensure it is a digit within the specified range (`start` to `end`).

4. **HTML File Processing**:
   - For each valid directory, all `.html` files are listed.
   - For each `.html` file, two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) are created in the same directory.

5. **Main Execution Block**:
   - The function is called with specific ranges (`start_range = 1951`, `end_range = 1980`).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program `func()` does not seem to relate to the problem description at all. It appears to be a different program designed to process some input related to counting characters in a string. This program does not interact with directories or files in any way, which is required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided program `func()` is unrelated to the task described in the problem, the given code snippet for `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is indeed correct for the problem it is supposed to solve.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
