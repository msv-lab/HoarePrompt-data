Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the other variables or objects. Since no other operations or conditions affect this print statement, it will always print `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
