Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string, and `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())` and `count_1` remains unchanged.
