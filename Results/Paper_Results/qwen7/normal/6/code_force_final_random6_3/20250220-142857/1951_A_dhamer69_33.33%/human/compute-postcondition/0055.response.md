Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`**.

Explanation: The code counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `count_1`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
