Output State: `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 9, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` (the second element of `l1`) is 1 after all iterations, and `k` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues until `k` becomes 0. Given the initial value of `k` is a non-zero integer, let's assume it starts as 7 (a common example for such problems). The loop processes each bit of `k` from the least significant to the most significant. 

- After the 1st iteration, `k` becomes `7 >> 1` which is 3, and `i` becomes 1. `arr` contains [1].
- After the 2nd iteration, `k` becomes `3 >> 1` which is 1, and `i` becomes 4. `arr` contains [1, 4].
- After the 3rd iteration, `k` becomes `1 >> 1` which is 0, and `i` becomes 5. `arr` contains [1, 4].

Since `k` is now 0, the loop terminates. `i` will continue to increment by 1 in each subsequent step but since the loop condition `k` is no longer met, `i` will eventually reach a large value, but for the final state, we consider the last valid `i` value before `k` became 0, which is 5. However, the problem specifies the state after all iterations, implying `i` would keep incrementing beyond 5, so we can say `i` is 9 (or any large value, but typically the next logical step after the loop ends).

The other variables (`arr`, `ans`, `k0`, `n`) remain as described after the third iteration because they are not modified within the loop body.
