Output: **-11 16 -5 256 -32769 65536 0 0**

Explanation:
- `ans` is explicitly defined as a list containing the values \[-11, 16, -5, 256, -32769, 65536, 0, 0\].
- The `print(*ans)` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print each element of the list `ans` separated by spaces.
- Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `ans` printed in the order they appear, separated by spaces.
