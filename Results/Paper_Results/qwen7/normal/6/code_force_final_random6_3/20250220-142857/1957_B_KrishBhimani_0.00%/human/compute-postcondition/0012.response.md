Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` is now equal to `k0` divided by 2 (since `k` was originally odd, `k >> 1` performs an integer division by 2), `arr` is a list containing the integer `0`, `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `k` has been updated to `k0 // 2` due to the right shift operation (`k >> 1`), which effectively divides `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
