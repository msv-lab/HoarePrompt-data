The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is increased by 1 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop condition), `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `ans` now contains the new element which is `1 << i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still contain at least one element, and `i` will be set to the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`**
