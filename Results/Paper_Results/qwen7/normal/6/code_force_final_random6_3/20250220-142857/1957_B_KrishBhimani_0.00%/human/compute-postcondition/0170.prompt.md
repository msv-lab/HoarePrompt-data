You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        arr = []
        
        k0 = k
        
        i = 0
        
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        
        ans = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `ans` of length `n`. The list `arr` will contain indices where `k` had its least significant bit set to 1 during the loop. The variable `c` will be equal to `n` plus the number of bits set in `k`. The list `ans` will start with values derived from powers of 2 based on the indices in `arr`, and will be extended by zeros to match the length of `n`. Specifically, `ans` will contain values calculated as follows:
    #
    #- For each index `i` in `arr`, `ans` will include `1 << i`.
    #- If `c` equals `n - 1`, the remaining elements of `ans` will be filled with the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, followed by zeros to reach the length `n`.
    #
    #Given the example provided, if the loop runs multiple times and the final state of `arr` contains the indices where `k` had its bits set, and if `c` is calculated correctly, the final `ans` will be constructed according to the described rules. Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are not specified, the final `ans` will depend on these inputs, but it will follow the pattern described above.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a value based on the conditions provided, where `n` is between 1 and 2⋅10^5, and `k` is between 1 and 10^9, with the constraint that the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
