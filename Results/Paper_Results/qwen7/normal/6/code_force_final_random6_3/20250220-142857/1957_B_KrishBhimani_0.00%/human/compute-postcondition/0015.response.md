Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` must be non-zero, `arr` is a list containing the integers `0` and `1`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. After appending, `arr` now contains `[0, 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
