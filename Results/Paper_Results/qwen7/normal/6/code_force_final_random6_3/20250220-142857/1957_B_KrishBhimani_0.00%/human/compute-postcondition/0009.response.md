Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` is non-zero and currently equal to `k0`, `arr` is a list containing the integer `0`, `i` is 0, and `k` is odd.**

The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
