Output State: **`c` is 9, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 4, `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by `i` positions, where `i` is 4. This operation results in `16` (binary `10000`). The `ans` list initially contains `-11`. After appending `16`, `ans` becomes `[-11, 16]`. The other variables (`c`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
