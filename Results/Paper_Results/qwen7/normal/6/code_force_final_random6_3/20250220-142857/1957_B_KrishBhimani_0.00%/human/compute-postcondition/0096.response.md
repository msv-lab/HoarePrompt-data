Postcondition: `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `ans` contains a new element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`, assuming the condition `c == n - 1` is true. If the condition `c == n - 1` is false, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition, meaning `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `ans` does not change.
