Output State: **`arr` is a list containing all the indices where `i` was incremented and `k & 1 == 1` was true, `i` is the final value of `i` which is `k0 + 1`, `c` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is 0, and `k0` is equal to the initial value of `k` before it became 0.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `c`. Since `c` was previously defined as `new input value + 2`, it is now set to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
