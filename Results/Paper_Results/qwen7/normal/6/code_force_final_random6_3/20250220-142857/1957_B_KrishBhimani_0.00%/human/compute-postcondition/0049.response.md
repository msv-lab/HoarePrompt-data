Postcondition: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and 2, and the fourth element is 16.**

Explanation:
- If `c == n - 1`, the third element of `ans` is appended with `2`, making the list `ans` as `[1, 1, 2, 16]`.
- Since there is no else part, if `c != n - 1`, the list `ans` remains unchanged, i.e., `[1, 1, k0 - (1 + 1 + (k0 - 2)), 16]`, simplifying to `[1, 1, 2, 16]`.

Thus, regardless of the condition, the final state of `ans` is `[1, 1, 2, 16]`.
