Output State: **`k` is `k` right-shifted by 1 and the result is non-zero; if the least significant bit of the right-shifted `k` is 1, then `arr` is a list containing the integer `i`; otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` right-shifts the value of `k` by 1 bit. After the right shift, `k` becomes a non-zero value (as per the postcondition). The least significant bit of the new value of `k` is checked. If it is 1, then `arr` is updated to be a list containing the integer `i`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.
