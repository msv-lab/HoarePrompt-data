Output State: **`arr` is [0], `i` is 0, `c` is equal to the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number, `k0` is equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `c` remains as `new input value + 2`, `ans` is still a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is still the integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is still a non-zero odd number, and `k0` is still equal to `k`.
