Output State: **`arr` is [0, 1, 3], `i` is 3, `c` is the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is now `k >> 1` (which means `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 using bitwise right shift), `k0` is equal to `k` and must be even.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, which divides `k` by 2. Since `k` was defined as a non-zero odd number divided by 2 using bitwise right shift, it implies that `k` is already the result of such an operation. After the operation, `k` remains `k >> 1`, and `k0` remains even as it is equal to `k`. All other variables (`arr`, `i`, `c`, `ans`, `n`) remain unchanged.
