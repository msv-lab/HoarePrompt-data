Reasoning:
- The program iterates over a specified number of test cases (`t`).
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
- It constructs an array `arr` that captures the indices of the least significant bits of `k` that are set to 1.
- Then, it constructs the array `ans` by setting specific elements to powers of 2 based on the indices in `arr` and filling the rest with zeros to ensure the total length is `n`.
- The sum of the elements in `ans` should equal `k`, and the bitwise OR of the elements in `ans` should maximize the number of 1s in its binary representation.
- The logic for constructing `arr` and `ans` appears to be correct based on the problem description and examples provided.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it seems to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
