Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` is now equal to `k0` (which is initially `k`) right-shifted by the number of iterations of the loop, `arr` is a list containing the integers from `0` to the number of iterations - 1, `i` is equal to the number of iterations, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The given code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
