Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 0, `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially empty, `sum(ans)` is 0, making the appended value simply `k0`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
