Output State: **`arr` is a list containing [1], `i` is 4, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` (the second element of `l1`) is a non-zero integer, and `k` is now `k >> 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`arr`, `c`, `ans`, `k0`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
