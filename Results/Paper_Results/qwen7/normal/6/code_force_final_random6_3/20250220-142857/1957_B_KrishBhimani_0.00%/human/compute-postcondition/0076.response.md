Output State: **`arr` is [0, 1, 3], `i` is 3, `c` is the new input value + 2, `ans` is a list with elements as specified and extended by 0s to match the new length of `n`, `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the last element of `l1` and converting it to an integer, `k` is a non-zero odd number divided by 2 using bitwise right shift, `k0` is equal to `k` and must be even, and `k` is now `k >> 1**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` becomes `[0, 1, 3]`. The values of `i`, `c`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `k0` remain as they were in the initial state.
