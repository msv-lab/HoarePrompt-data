Output State: **`arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 1, `c` is 7, `ans` is a list with the values [0, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends a new element to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is `[0]` because it was defined as `[0] * (n - len(ans))` where `n` is 8 and `len(ans)` is 0. The expression `k0 - sum(ans)` evaluates to `0 - 0` which is `0`. So, the new element appended to `ans` is `0`. After appending, `ans` becomes `[0]`. Then, the next operation appends `-1` to `ans` because `sum(ans)` is now `0` and `k0` is `0`, so `k0 - sum(ans)` is `0 - 0` which is `0`, and the expression `0 << 1` (left shift by 1) results in `-1`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `[0, -1]`.
