Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is explicitly given as 6.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). Since no specific value for `t` is given, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `x` is explicitly given as 13.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(ansv[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `ansv` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value or contents. However, the code snippet is trying to access `ansv[i]` where `i` is 1. Since `ansv` is not defined, we cannot provide a precise value for `ansv[i]`.

Given this information, the output will depend on the value of `ansv[1]`, which is unknown.

Output: **ansv[1]**
