Output State: `mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 4, and `i` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop executes three times, we know that `x` is reduced to 13, `subseq_lens` contains the values 6 and 4, and `mx` is either 6 or 4. Since the loop breaks when `x` is no longer greater than or equal to `2**i - 1`, and given the output state after three iterations, it's clear that `x` will not be modified further, and `i` will be 0 as the loop condition fails. Therefore, `mx` remains 6 because it was already set to 6 in the first iteration and was not updated to a higher value in subsequent iterations.
