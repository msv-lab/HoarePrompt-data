Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences is flawed. The program attempts to use powers of 2 to construct the required array, but this approach does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The program tries to decompose `X-1` into a sum of distinct powers of 2, which is not always possible or necessary to achieve the exact count of increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction Logic**: The construction of the array based on the calculated subsequence lengths does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic assumes that appending certain values will directly result in the desired number of increasing subsequences, which is not generally true.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that can accurately count and construct the array to meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences. This might involve dynamic programming or other combinatorial techniques to ensure the correctness of the solution.
