Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is 6
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `x` is 13
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4
- `i` is 8
- `ansv` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4

The code snippet is:
```python
print(len(ansv))
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. `subseq_lens` is a list with values [6, 4, 4].
2. The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of `subseq_lens` (which is 3).
3. Each iteration appends the current element of `subseq_lens` to `ansv` twice.
4. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, which is 3. However, since each element in `subseq_lens` is appended twice, `ansv` will have 4 additional elements (4, 4), making the total length of `ansv` 10.

Given this, the length of `ansv` is 10.

Output: **10**
