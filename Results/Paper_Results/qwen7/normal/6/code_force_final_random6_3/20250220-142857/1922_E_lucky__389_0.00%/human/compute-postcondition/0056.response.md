Postcondition: **`mx` is either 6 or 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 4, and `i` is 4.**

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- `mx` will be either 6 or 4.
- `t` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `x` will be 13.
- `subseq_lens` will be a list containing the values 6 and 4.
- `i` will be 4.
