You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 4, and `i` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes three times, we know that `x` is reduced to 13, `subseq_lens` contains the values 6 and 4, and `mx` is either 6 or 4. Since the loop breaks when `x` is no longer greater than or equal to `2**i - 1`, and given the output state after three iterations, it's clear that `x` will not be modified further, and `i` will be 0 as the loop condition fails. Therefore, `mx` remains 6 because it was already set to 6 in the first iteration and was not updated to a higher value in subsequent iterations.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4, `i` is 8, `ansv` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of `subseq_lens`. Since `subseq_lens` has 3 elements (6, 4, 4), the loop will execute 2 times (from index 1 to 2). Each iteration appends the current element of `subseq_lens` to `ansv`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, which is 3. However, based on the pattern observed, each element in `subseq_lens` is appended twice to `ansv`, so after 2 iterations, `ansv` will contain 4 additional elements (4, 4) making the total length of `ansv` 9. Therefore, `i` will be 8 when the loop finishes.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 10
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4, `i` is 3, `ansv` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range starting from 0 to the length of `subseq_lens` minus 1. Since `subseq_lens` has 3 elements, the loop will execute 3 times (from index 0 to 2). Each iteration appends the current element of `subseq_lens` to `ansv` twice. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the length of `subseq_lens`, which is 3. `ansv` will contain all elements of `subseq_lens` appended twice, resulting in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^18. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.
