Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is an input integer - 1 and `x` must not be 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - The current value of `i` is 1.
   - The condition becomes `2 ** (1 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `4 <= x + 1`.
   - This means `x + 1` must be at least 4, or `x` must be at least 3.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must still hold true for `i = 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` must be adjusted to 2.
   - `x` must be at least 3 to satisfy the condition `4 <= x + 1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
