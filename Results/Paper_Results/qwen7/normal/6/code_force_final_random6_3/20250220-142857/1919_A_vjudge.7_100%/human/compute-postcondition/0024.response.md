Functionality: **The function reads multiple pairs of non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) from the user, checks if their sum is even or odd, and prints 'Bob' if the sum is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd for each pair. After processing all input pairs, it returns nothing.**
