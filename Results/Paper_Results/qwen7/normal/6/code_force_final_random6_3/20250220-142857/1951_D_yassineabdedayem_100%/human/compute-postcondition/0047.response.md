Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, it processes two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}). The function returns different values based on the relationship between n, k, and t for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. For each set of these values, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns a result based on the given conditions.
