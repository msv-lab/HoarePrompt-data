Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\).
- `n` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n` and `2 * k - 2`.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the value of `n` is determined by comparing `n` and `2 * k - 2`, and the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. However, this does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **'YES'**
