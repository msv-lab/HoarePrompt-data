Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state provides that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, but it does not affect the print statement. The values of `n` and `k` are read from standard input, and their specific values do not change the output of the print statement. The condition `n + 2` being less than or equal to `k * 2` is also given, but this condition does not influence the content of the print statement either. Therefore, the print statement will always output "NO".
