Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 998\).
- `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), where `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- `k` is an integer read from standard input.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `n`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **'YES'**
