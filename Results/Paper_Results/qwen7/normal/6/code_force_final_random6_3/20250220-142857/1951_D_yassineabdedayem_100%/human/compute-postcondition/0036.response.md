Output: **1**

Explanation: The print statement `print(1)` directly prints the integer 1. According to the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 998, `n` is the minimum of the original `n` and \(2 * k - 2\), and `k` is an integer read from standard input. These variables do not affect the execution of the print statement itself, which simply outputs the integer 1.
