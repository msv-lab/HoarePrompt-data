Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in the `func` function is flawed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels under all circumstances.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n == k`, the program correctly outputs "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1.
   - **Case 2**: When `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program also correctly outputs "YES" and sets up 2 stalls. However, the logic for setting the prices is incorrect. For example, consider `n = 6` and `k = 4`. According to the condition, the program should output "YES" and set up 2 stalls. However, it prints `5 1`, which means Alice would buy 5 jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling 6 jewels, which is more than `k = 4`.

2. **Example Counter-Case**:
   - Consider `n = 6` and `k = 4`. The program should output "YES" and set up 2 stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly 4 jewels. However, the current implementation sets up stalls with prices `5` and `1`, resulting in Alice buying 6 jewels in total. This violates the requirement to buy exactly `k` jewels.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution that guarantees Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels for all valid inputs. It only handles specific conditions without ensuring the correct behavior for all possible scenarios.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
