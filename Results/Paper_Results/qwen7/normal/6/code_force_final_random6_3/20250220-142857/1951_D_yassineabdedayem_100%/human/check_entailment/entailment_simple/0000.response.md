### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. However, the logic in the program is flawed and incomplete. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
2. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**: If Alice has exactly \( k \) coins, she can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by setting the price of each stall to 1 coin. This case is handled correctly.
3. **Case 2: \( n + 2 > 2k \)**: This condition is intended to handle cases where Alice has more than twice the number of coins needed to buy \( k \) jewels. However, the logic here is incorrect. For example, if \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \), the condition \( n + 2 > 2k \) is true, but the program prints "YES" and sets the prices incorrectly. The correct approach would be to distribute the coins across multiple stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
4. **Case 3: Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NO". This is correct for cases where it is impossible to achieve the desired outcome with the given constraints.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:

- **Case 1**: Correctly handles the scenario where \( n = k \).
- **Case 2**: Incorrectly handles the scenario where \( n + 2 > 2k \). The current implementation sets the price of the first stall to \( n - k + 1 \) and the price of the second stall to 1, which may not always result in Alice buying exactly \( k \) jewels.
- **Case 3**: Correctly handles the default case where it is impossible to achieve the desired outcome.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels by distributing the coins across multiple stalls. One possible solution is to use a greedy approach where we set the prices such that Alice buys one jewel from each stall until she reaches \( k \) jewels.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n >= k:
            print('YES')
            print(k)
            print(*[1] * k)
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the distribution of coins across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
