Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 998\).
- `n` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n` and `2 * k - 2`, where `k` is an integer read from standard input.
- The `print('YES')` statement is executed.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'. Since no specific value for `k` is given, it will be determined by user input, but this does not affect the output of the print statement.

Output: **YES**
