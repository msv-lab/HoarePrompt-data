Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the value entered by the user as a string, `s2` is a string input by the user, `a1` is the number of '1's in the string `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1's in the string `s2`**.

Explanation: The code `a2 = s2.count('1')` counts the number of '1's in the string `s2` and assigns this count to the variable `a2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `a1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
