Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is 0, `res` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the variables `i`, `n`, `hd`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `hd` is 1 less than its original value, making it 0.
