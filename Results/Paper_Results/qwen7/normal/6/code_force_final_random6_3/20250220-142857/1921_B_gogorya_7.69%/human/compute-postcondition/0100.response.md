Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`, `i` is less than `n` and becomes `i + 1`. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decremented by 1 and the loop continues.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given that `res` was initially equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, after this operation, `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
