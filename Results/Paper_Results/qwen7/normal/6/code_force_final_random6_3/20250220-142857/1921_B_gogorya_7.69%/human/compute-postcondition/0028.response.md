Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `hd` is set to -1.
   - `res` is set to 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `hd`, and `res` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the increment.
   - `hd` is set to -1, so it remains -1.
   - `res` is either 1 or unchanged, depending on the conditions in the if statement. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we cannot determine the exact value of `res` without knowing the current values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`. Therefore, we will keep `res` as it is.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains the same as it was before the increment.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `hd` remains -1.
   - `res` remains as it was before the increment (either 1 or unchanged).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is -1, and `res` remains as it was before the increment.**
