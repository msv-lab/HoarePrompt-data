#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of '0' and '1', indicating the initial state of the boxes; the third line contains a string f of length n consisting of '0' and '1', indicating the desired state of the boxes. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - n`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` with each iteration until it reaches `n`. The value of `hd` decreases by 1 for each iteration where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', but since the loop continues when `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` will eventually reach `a1 - a2 - n` once `hd` can no longer be decremented. The variable `res` is incremented by 1 for each such iteration, resulting in `res` being equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + n`. The counts of '1's in `s1` (`a1`) and `s2` (`a2`) do not change within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \), and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by string \( s \)) to the desired state (represented by string \( f \)). The function outputs the total number of operations needed for each test case.
