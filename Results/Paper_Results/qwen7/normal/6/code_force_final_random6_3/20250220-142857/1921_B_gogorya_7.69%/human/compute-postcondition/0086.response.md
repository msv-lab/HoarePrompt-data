Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 1` and is currently greater than -1, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2)`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is less than `n`**.

Explanation: The value of `hd` is decremented by 1, so `hd` becomes `a1 - a2 - 1`. Since `hd` was initially greater than 0, subtracting 1 from it means `hd` is now greater than -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
