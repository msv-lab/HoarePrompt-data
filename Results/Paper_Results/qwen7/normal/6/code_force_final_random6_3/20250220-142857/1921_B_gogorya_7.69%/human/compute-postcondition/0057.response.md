Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `hd` is decreased by 1.
   - `res` is 1 if `s1[i]` equals '1' and `s2[i]` equals '0'. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains greater than 0, `hd` remains decreased by 1, and `res` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function, at the start of the first iteration, `i` would be 0. After the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.
   - `hd` is decreased by 1 (this is a one-time decrement, so it will remain decreased by 1).
   - `res` remains unchanged unless specific conditions are met, but since we are starting the next iteration, `res` will remain as it was after the previous iteration.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `hd` will remain decreased by 1.
   - `res` will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1, `res` remains unchanged**.
