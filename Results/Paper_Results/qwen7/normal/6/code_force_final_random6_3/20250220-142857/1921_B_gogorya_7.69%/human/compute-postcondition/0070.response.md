Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is -1, `res` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` was initially unchanged from the precondition, and the only change is that it has been incremented by 1, the new value of `res` is 1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and `hd`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
