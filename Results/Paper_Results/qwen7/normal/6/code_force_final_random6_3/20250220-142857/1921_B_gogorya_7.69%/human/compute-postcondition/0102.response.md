Postcondition: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 2`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `i` is less than `n` and becomes `i + 1`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `hd` is decremented by 1 to become `a1 - a2 - 3` and `res` is incremented by 1 to become `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`. If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', the values of `hd` and `res` remain unchanged.
