Output State: `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - n`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` at the end of each iteration. For every time the loop executes, `hd` is decremented by 1 as long as `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. Therefore, after `n` iterations, `hd` will be `a1 - a2 - n`. The variable `res` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', so it will be `abs(a1 - a2) + n`. The counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` (`a1` and `a2`) do not change within the loop, so they remain the same as their initial values.
