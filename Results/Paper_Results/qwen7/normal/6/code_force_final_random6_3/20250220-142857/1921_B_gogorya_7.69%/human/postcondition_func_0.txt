The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \), and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by string \( s \)) to the desired state (represented by string \( f \)). The function outputs the total number of operations needed for each test case.
