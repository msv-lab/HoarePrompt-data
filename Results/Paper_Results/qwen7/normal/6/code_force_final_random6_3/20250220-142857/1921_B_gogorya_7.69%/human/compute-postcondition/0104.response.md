Output State: **`hd` is equal to `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, `res` is equal to `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` or `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `hd` is decreased by 1. Given that `hd` was initially `a1 - a2 - 3` or `a1 - a2 - 2`, after subtracting 1, it becomes `a1 - a2 - 4` or `a1 - a2 - 3`, respectively.
- The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
