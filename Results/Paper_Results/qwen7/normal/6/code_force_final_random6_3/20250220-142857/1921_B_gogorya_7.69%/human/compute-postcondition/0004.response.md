Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the value entered by the user as a string, `s2` is a string input by the user.**

The code `s2 = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `s2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `s1`) remain unchanged with their initial values.
