Postcondition: `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the first element of `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele`, and `maxi` remains the maximum of 0 and the maximum element of `l` up to the point where the code was executed. Otherwise, `c` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
