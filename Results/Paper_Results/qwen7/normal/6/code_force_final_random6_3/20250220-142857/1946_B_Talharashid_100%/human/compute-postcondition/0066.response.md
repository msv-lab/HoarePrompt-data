Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the second input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code sets `c` to 0. All other variables (`maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
