Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the third element of `l`, `c` is the sum of the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum between the current value of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `c` and `maxi`, the updated value of `maxi` will be the larger of the two. The other variables (`l`, `ele`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
