Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxi` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element left, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is updated as follows: if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0; otherwise, `c` is updated by adding `ele` to its current value, and `maxi` is now the maximum of the new `c` and `maxi`. `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
