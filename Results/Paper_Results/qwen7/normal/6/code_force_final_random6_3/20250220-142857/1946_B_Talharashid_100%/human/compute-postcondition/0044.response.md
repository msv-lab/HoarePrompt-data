Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is `c + ele`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element, and either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element, and either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)` remains valid.
