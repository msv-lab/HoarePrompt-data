Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, `i` is `int(input())`, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is the last value it was updated to, `l` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them based on space, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `k`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, `c`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state.
