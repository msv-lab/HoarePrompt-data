Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxi` is 0, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the second input string and converting each element to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele
        maxi = max(c, maxi)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`, `i` is the first input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `c` is `c + ele`, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and `0`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is updated to 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + 2 * ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, `c` is updated based on the next `ele` in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
