Output State: **`maxi` is the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`. Since `maxi` was initially the maximum of `c + ele` and 0, and `c` is updated based on the next `ele` in the list `l`, `maxi` is now updated to be the maximum of the new `c` and the previous `maxi`.
