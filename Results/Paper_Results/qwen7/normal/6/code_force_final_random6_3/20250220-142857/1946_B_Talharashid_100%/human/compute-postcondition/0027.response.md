Postcondition: `l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the third element of `l`, and `maxi` is the maximum between the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and the previous value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of the previous value of `c` and the third element of `l`.
