Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each element (`ele`) in the list `l`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
   - `ele` will take on each value from the list `l` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. If `l` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is the only object that affects whether the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `l` contains at least one element.
   - The values of `maxi`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `i` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `l` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`maxi` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces that must have at least one element**
