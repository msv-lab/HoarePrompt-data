Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the current `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. Since the initial value of `maxi` is not specified, it remains as the maximum between `c` and the existing `maxi`. The list `l` and its second element `ele` remain unchanged.
