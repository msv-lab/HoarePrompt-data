Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ele` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`. 

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: After the previous iteration, the postcondition states that:
   - `l` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `ele` is the first element of `l`.
   - If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to the absolute value of `ele`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `maxi` is also updated to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

4. **Determine the Next Element**: Since `ele` is the first element of `l` in the current iteration, the next element `ele` in the next iteration will be the second element of `l`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `l` remains the same as it is a list that does not change within the loop.
   - `ele` changes to the second element of `l`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `l` remains a non-empty list of integers.
   - `ele` becomes the second element of `l`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `ele` is the second element of `l`**.
