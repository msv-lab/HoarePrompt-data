The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. It performs a binary search on `array` to find the index of `find`. If `find` is in `array`, it returns a list containing the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1 twice. If `find` is not in `array`, it prints `0` and returns a list containing the index of `l` incremented by 1 twice. The list `array` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
