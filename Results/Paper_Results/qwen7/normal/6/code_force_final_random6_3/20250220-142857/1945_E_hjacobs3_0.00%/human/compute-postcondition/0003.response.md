Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2**

In this step, the variable `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `l` and `r`. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is set to `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
