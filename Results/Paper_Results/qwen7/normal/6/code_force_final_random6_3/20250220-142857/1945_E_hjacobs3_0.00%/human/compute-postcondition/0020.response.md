Postcondition: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is either 0 or `mid + 1`, `r` is either `mid - 1` or at least 0, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`. If `array[mid] >= find`, then `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
