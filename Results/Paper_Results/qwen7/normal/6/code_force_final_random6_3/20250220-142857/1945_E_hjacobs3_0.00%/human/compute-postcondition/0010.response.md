Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `l <= r`.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `l` and `r`.

3. **Determine the current values of `l` and `r`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is `n - 1`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to 0 and `r` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - Otherwise, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` is updated to `n - 1`.

5. **Determine the conditions under which the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.
   - Given the initial values, the only way to ensure `l <= r` is to update `r` to `mid - 1` when `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.

6. **Check the possible values of `mid`**:
   - Initially, `mid` is `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(n - 1) // 2`.
   - After the first iteration, if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`, making the new `r` value `(n - 1) // 2 - 1`.

7. **Ensure the loop can continue**:
   - To ensure `l <= r`, the new `r` value should still be greater than or equal to `l` (which is 0).
   - Therefore, `(n - 1) // 2 - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0.

8. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` remains 0, no adjustment is needed for `l`.
   - `r` must be adjusted to ensure `l <= r`. The minimum value for `r` that satisfies this condition is `1` (since `(n - 1) // 2 - 1` must be at least 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `r` is at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, `r` must be at least 1, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2**
