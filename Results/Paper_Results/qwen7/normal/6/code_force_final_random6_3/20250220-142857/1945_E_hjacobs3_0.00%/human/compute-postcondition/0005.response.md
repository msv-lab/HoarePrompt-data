Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, `r` is mid - 1, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2, and the value of `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.**

Explanation: The code `r = mid - 1` updates the value of `r` to `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still `(0 + (n - 1)) // 2`, and the condition that `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find` is also preserved.
