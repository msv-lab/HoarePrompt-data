Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is 0, `r` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is (0 + (n - 1)) // 2**

Explanation: The value of `r` is updated to `mid - 1`. The other variables (`array`, `l`, `mid`) retain their previous values. The value of `mid` is calculated as (0 + (n - 1)) // 2, which remains unchanged after the assignment.
