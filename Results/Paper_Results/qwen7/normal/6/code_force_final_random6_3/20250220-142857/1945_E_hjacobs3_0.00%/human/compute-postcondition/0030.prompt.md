You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `array` remains a permutation of integers of length `n`, `l` is either 0 or the final value it takes after the last iteration, `r` is either `mid - 1` or 0, and `mid` is the final midpoint calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `array` stays the same, `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one, `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0, and `mid` will be the final midpoint value. The loop terminates when `l` becomes greater than `r`, indicating that the search range has been exhausted without finding an element that meets the condition `array[mid] >= find`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` incremented by 1.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The list `array` remains a permutation of integers of length `n`, `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one, `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0, and `mid` will be the final midpoint value. The search range has been exhausted without finding an element that meets the condition `array[mid] >= find`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in the list `array` incremented by 1, and the second string is also the index of `find` in the list `array` incremented by 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `l` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` in the list `array` incremented by 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
