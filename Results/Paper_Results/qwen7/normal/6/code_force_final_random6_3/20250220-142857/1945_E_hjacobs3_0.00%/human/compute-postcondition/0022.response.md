Output State: The array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, `l` is either 0 or `mid + 1`, `r` is either `mid - 1` or 0, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `l` will either be 0 or one position to the right of `mid`, and the variable `r` will either be `mid - 1` or 0. The variable `mid` will be the integer resulting from the expression `(l + r) // 2`. This final state indicates that the binary search process has either found the target value (if it exists in the array) or has narrowed down the search range to the point where no further division is possible.
