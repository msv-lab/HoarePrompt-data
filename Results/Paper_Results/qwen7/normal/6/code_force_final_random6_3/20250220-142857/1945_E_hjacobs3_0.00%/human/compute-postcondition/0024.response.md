Postcondition: **The list `array` remains a permutation of integers of length `n`, `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one, `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0, and `mid` will be the final midpoint value. The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the list `array`.**
