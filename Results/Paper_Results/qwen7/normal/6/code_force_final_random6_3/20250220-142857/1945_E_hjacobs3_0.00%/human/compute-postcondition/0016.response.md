To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

- The loop condition is `l <= r`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
  - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
  - `l` is either 0 or `mid + 1`.
  - `r` is either `mid - 1` or at least 1.
  - `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l <= r` must still hold true. Let's consider the possible values of `l` and `r`:

1. If `l` is 0 and `r` is `mid - 1`, then for the loop to continue, `r` must be at least 0 (since `l` is 0, `r` must be non-negative).
2. If `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is at least 1, then for the loop to continue, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Given these conditions, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to `l` and `r` because they directly affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `l` must be 0 or `mid + 1`.
- `r` must be `mid - 1` or at least 1, but to ensure the loop continues, `r` must be at least 0 if `l` is 0, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is either 0 or `mid + 1`, `r` is either `mid - 1` or at least 0, and `mid` is updated to `(l + r) // 2`**
