Based on the initial state provided:

- `array` is a permutation of integers of length `n`.
- `l` will be either 0 or the last computed midpoint plus one.
- `r` will be either the last computed midpoint minus one or 0.
- `mid` will be the final midpoint value.
- The search range has been exhausted without finding an element that meets the condition `array[mid] >= find`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(0)` will simply output the integer 0, as it is explicitly stated in the code.

Output: **0**
