Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, `l` is either 0 or `mid + 1`, `r` is either `mid - 1` or at least 0, and `mid` is now `(l + r) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to `(l + r) // 2`. Since `l` can be either 0 or `mid + 1`, and `r` can be either `mid - 1` or at least 0, the new value of `mid` is calculated based on these conditions. The other variables remain unchanged.
