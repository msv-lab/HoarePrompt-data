Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required solution. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search is implemented correctly, but the purpose of the search is misunderstood. The search is intended to find the position where `x` should be inserted to maintain the permutation property after at most 2 swaps. However, the current implementation simply checks if `find` exists in the array and returns its index or indicates that no swap is needed. This does not address the requirement to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the binary search.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function only returns the indices of the first swap if `find` is not already at the correct position (`l`). However, the problem statement requires performing up to 2 swaps, and the current implementation does not account for the second swap if necessary.

3. **Output Format**: The function prints `1` or `0` and returns a list of indices, which is not aligned with the expected output format. The expected output format is to print the number of operations (0, 1, or 2) followed by the pairs of indices for the swaps.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
