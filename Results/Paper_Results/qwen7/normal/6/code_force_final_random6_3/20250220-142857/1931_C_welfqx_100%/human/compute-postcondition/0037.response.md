Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and the element at index `i` in `num` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1` in `num`. We break out of the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or the elements in the list `num`. It only indicates that the loop or statement being executed is terminated prematurely. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
