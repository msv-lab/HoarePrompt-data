Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop body (only `i` was modified).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
