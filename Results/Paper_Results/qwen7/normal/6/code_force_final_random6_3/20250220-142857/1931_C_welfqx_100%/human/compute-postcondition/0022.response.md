Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2` (since the loop runs `n - 1` times and breaks if it finds non-equal consecutive elements), `n` remains unchanged, and either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1**.
