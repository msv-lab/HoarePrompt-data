Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` ranges from `0` to `n-2`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - If the element at index `i` of `num` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`, then `n` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are not equal, and the loop exits.

4. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop body is met (i.e., if the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal, `n` is increased by 1).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` will remain the same unless the condition inside the loop body is met.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same unless the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal**.

To provide a concrete example based on the given format:
- If `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
- `n` will remain the same as it did not change in the previous iteration.

Thus, the state can be written as:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, and `n` remains the same unless the elements at indices `i` and `i + 1` are equal**.
