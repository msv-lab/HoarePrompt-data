Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is either 1 or 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the loop cannot execute further due to the precondition, the variables remain unchanged, and the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block.
