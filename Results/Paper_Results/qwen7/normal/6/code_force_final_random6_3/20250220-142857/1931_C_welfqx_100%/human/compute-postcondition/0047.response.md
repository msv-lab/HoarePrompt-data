Output State: **After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes 2; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no other variables are affected by this statement, the values of `i` and `n` remain as they were before the `break`.
