Postcondition: `ii` is 1, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `onum[1]` is equal to `onum[2]`, and `num` is a list. If `onum[1]` is equal to `onum[2]`, then `cn` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cn` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
