Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, and either `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
