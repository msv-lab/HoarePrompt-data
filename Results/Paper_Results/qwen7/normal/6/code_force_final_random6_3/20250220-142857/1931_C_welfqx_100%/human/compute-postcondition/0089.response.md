Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and if the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, then `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the element at index `j` of `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, then no change occurs to `f`.
