Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is `t`, `ii` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution (`ck`), `num` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `ck` holds the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached, `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `f` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and either the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, in which case `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or the element at index `j` of `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, and no change occurs to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and if the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, then `f` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the element at index `j` of `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`, then no change occurs to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, and if `num[2]` is not equal to `num[3]`, then `f` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `num[2]` is equal to `num[3]`, then no change occurs to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
