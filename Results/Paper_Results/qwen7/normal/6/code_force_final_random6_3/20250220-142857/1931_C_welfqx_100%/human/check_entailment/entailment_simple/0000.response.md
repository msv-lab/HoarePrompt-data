Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Each operation can set a contiguous subarray to a single value and costs `(j - i + 1)` burles.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The solution provided attempts to find the longest subsequence of consecutive identical elements in both the original array and its reverse.
   - The idea is to use the longer of these two subsequences to minimize the cost. Specifically, it calculates the cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`, where `cn` is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in the original array, and `ck` is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence in the reversed array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, the cost is 0.
   - If the array has a single element, the cost is also 0.
   - The approach considers reversing the array to handle cases where the longest consecutive sequence might start from the end.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the longest consecutive sequences in both directions.
   - It calculates the cost based on the maximum length of these sequences, which aligns with the goal of minimizing the cost.

5. **Code Verification**:
   - The code iterates through the array to find the longest consecutive sequence.
   - It reverses the array and repeats the process to ensure it captures the longest possible sequence in both directions.
   - The final cost calculation `n - max(cn, ck)` is correct because it represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the array uniform.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
