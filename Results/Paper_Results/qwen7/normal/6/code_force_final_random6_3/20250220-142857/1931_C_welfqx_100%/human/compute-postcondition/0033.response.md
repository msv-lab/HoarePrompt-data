Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts at 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is 0.
- `f` is 1.
- `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
- `j` is `n - 2`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list reversed.
- `ck` is 1.
- `symb1` is the first element of the `num` list.
- `symb2` is the first element of the reversed `num` list.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
