Output State: **`ii` will be `n - 2`, `n` will be a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution (`ck`), and `num` is a list. `ck` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached. `symb1` and `symb2` are equal.**

Explanation: The line `cn += ck` increments the value of `cn` by the value of `ck`. The values of `ii`, `n`, `num`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `ck` remain unchanged from their initial states. `cn` now includes the count of consecutive identical elements up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution.
