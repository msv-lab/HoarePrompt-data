Postcondition: **`ii` will be `n - 2`, `n` will be a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` will be the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2`, and `num` is a list. `ck` will hold the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached. `symb1` and `symb2` are equal.**
