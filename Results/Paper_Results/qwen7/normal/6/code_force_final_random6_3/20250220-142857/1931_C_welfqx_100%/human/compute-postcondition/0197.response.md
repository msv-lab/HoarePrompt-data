Output State: **`j` is `n-3`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program exits the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables retain their previous values.
