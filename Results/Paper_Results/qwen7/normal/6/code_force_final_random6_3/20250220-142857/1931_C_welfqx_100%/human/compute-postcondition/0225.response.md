Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns information based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns some form of output based on the given data, though the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.
