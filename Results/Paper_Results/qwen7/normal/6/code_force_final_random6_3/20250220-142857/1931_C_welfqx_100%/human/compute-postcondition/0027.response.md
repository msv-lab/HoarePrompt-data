Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, and `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list reversed.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum`. Since `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list, reversing `onum` changes its contents, but the original `num` list remains unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `j`, `n`) remain in their initial states.
