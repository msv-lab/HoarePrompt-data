Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num`; `f` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `j` remains 0, `n` is still greater than 1, the condition that the element at index `j` of `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1` of `num` is still true, and `f` remains 0. Additionally, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
