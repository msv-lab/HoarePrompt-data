Output State: **`cn` is incremented by `ck`, `n` is an integer, `onum` is a list of integers, `ck` will be incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached, and `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.**

Explanation: The variable `cn` is incremented by the value of `ck`. The values of `n`, `onum`, `ck`, and `symb1` remain unchanged from their initial states. `symb1` is still equal to `symb2`.
