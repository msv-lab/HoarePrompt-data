Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no other operations are performed on the variables, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
