Output State: **`r` is `t`, `ii` is `n - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `cn` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `num` up to index `n-2` plus the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution (`ck`), `num` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `ck` holds the count of consecutive identical elements encountered during the loop execution, and it will be incremented each time two consecutive elements in `num` are found to be identical until a pair of non-identical elements is encountered or the end of the list is reached, `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, `f` is 1.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list, converting each element to an integer. This updates the `num` list. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions, but `num` now contains the integer values from the input.
