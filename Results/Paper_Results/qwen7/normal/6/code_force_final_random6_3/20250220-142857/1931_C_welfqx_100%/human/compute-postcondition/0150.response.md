Output State: **`cn` is incremented by `ck`, `n` is an input integer, `onum` is a list of integers, `ck` is incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1] until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is further incremented by `ck`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, and `r` must be less than `t`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`cn`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `r`, `t`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
