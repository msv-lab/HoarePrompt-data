Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is 0**.

Explanation: The code sets `f` to 0. Since `j` was initially 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `f` is explicitly set to 0, so there's no need to consider the condition involving the elements of `num`.
