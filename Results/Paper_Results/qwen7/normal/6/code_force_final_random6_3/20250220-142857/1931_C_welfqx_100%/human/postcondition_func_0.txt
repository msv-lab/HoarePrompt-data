The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list), and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum number of deletions required to make the list either entirely increasing or decreasing. The function outputs this minimum number of deletions for each test case.
