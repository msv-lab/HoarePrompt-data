Postcondition: `num[j + 1]` and `num[j + 2]` are elements of the list `num`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, and if `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num[j]` is equal to `num[j + 1]`, there is no change in the values of the variables.
