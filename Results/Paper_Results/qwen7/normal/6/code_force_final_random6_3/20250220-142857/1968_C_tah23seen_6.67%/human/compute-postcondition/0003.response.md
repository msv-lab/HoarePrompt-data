Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` to be `arr[i] + ans[i]`. Given that initially `i` is 0, `i + 1` becomes 1. So, `ans[1]` is set to `arr[0] + ans[0]`. Since `ans[0]` was not initialized before this line, its value remains undefined, but the structure of the relationship is established. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is just a reference to the length of `arr` plus one.
