Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + ans[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[3]` is `ans[2] + ans[1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` becomes 3. So, `ans[3]` is updated to be the sum of `ans[2]` and `ans[1]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
