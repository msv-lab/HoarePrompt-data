Output State: The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`, and `ans[n - 1]` will be the result of repeatedly doubling `ans[8]` based on the given conditions. Specifically, `ans[n - 1]` will be \(2^{(n - 3 - 8) + 1} \times ans[8]\), which simplifies to \(2^{(n - 11)} \times ans[8]\).

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the value of `ans[n - 1]` will be \(2^{(n - 11)}\) times the value of `ans[8]`, assuming the loop conditions are met correctly.
