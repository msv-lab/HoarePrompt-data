Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, ans is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The values of `arr` and `t` remain unchanged from the initial state.
