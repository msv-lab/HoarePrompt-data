Output State: **`i` is 8; `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[9]`, which is now equal to `ans[8] + ans[8]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[9]`) by adding the current value of `ans[i]` (which is `ans[8]`) to it. Since `i` is initially 8, `ans[i + 1]` refers to `ans[9]`. The value of `ans[9]` is updated to be twice the value of `ans[8]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
