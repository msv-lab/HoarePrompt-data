Output State: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`. The value of `ans[n - 1]` will be `2^(n - 2) * ans[1]`, given the conditions of the loop. Since `ans[1]` is initially set to `arr[0] + ans[0]` and `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, we can express `ans[1]` as `2 * arr[0]`.

Therefore, the final value of `ans[n - 1]` will be `2^(n - 2) * 2 * arr[0] = 2^(n - 1) * arr[0]`.

The output state after all iterations of the loop will be: `i` is `n - 2`; `ans[n - 1]` is `2^(n - 1) * arr[0]`; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.
