Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains the value of `i` after it was incremented. Otherwise, `last` contains one additional element which is the same as the last element of the original list.
