Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list with the value `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `last.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `last`. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, appending `i` to the list `last` means `last` now contains the value `i + 1`. The values of `n` and `last` (before appending) remain unchanged, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
