You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The variable n represents the number of slimes, and a_i represents the size of the i-th slime.
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list where each element represents the index of the last occurrence of each unique element in the list `a` up to that point.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `n`, `a` is an empty list, `last` is an appropriately initialized list with each element representing the index of the last occurrence of each unique element in the original list `a`, and `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the original list `a`, `a` itself will be an empty list, `last` will contain the last indices of all unique elements from the original list, and `left` will be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` equals `n`, `a` is an empty list, `last` is a list where each element represents the last occurrence index of each unique element from the original list `a`, and `left` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the initial state, it is likely that `ans` could be related to the processing of list `a`, such as the last occurrence index of each unique element or the cumulative sums stored in `left`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` containing `n` integers (where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5) and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list. It returns `ans`, which is likely related to the processing of list `a`, such as the last occurrence index of each unique element or the cumulative sums stored in `left`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns ans, which is not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. However, based on the initial state, it is likely that `ans` could be related to the processing of list `a`, such as the last occurrence index of each unique element or the cumulative sums stored in `left`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
