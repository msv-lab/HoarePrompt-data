Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in a`. This means the loop variable is `i` and the iterable is `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is a non-empty list
   - `last` is an appropriately initialized list
   - `left` is a list with its last element updated to `left[-1] + 0`, which is equal to `left[-1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. Since `i` starts from 0, it will increment with each iteration.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be 1 (assuming the list `a` has at least two elements).
   - The list `a` remains the same since it is the iterable and not modified within the loop body.
   - The lists `last` and `left` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `a` remains a non-empty list.
   - `last` remains appropriately initialized.
   - `left` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty list, `last` is an appropriately initialized list, `left` is a list with its last element updated to `left[-1]`**.
