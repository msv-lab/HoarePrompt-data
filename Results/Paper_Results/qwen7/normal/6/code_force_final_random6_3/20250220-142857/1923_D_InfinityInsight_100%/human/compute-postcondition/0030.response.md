Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `n`, `a` is an empty list, `last` is an appropriately initialized list with each element representing the index of the last occurrence of each unique element in the original list `a`, and `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the original list `a`, `a` itself will be an empty list, `last` will contain the last indices of all unique elements from the original list, and `left` will be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
