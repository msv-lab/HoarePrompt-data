Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` containing `n` integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5) and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list. It constructs two auxiliary lists: `last`, which stores the last occurrence index of each unique element in `a`, and `left`, which contains the cumulative sums of the elements in `a`. Finally, it computes a result list `ans` based on certain conditions involving these auxiliary lists. The function returns `ans`, which likely indicates the number of operations needed to transform each element in `a` into the smallest possible value through specific operations defined by the conditions.**
