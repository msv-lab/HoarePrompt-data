Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` equals `n`, `a` is an empty list, `last` is an appropriately initialized list with each element representing the index of the last occurrence of each unique element in the original list `a`, and `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that point in the iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the original list `a`, `a` itself will be an empty list, `last` will contain the last indices of all unique elements from the original list, and `left` will be a list of cumulative sums of the elements in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `ans[2]` is 2, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[0]`, `inx` is `last[0`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`, `ans[i]` is `i + 1 - inx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[3]`, `ans[i]` is `i + 1 - inx`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
