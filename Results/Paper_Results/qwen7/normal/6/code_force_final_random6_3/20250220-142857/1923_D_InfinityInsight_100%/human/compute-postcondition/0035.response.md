Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans[i]` is 1; `n` is the length of the original list `a`; the current value of `a[i]` is less than the previous value `a[i - 1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

This means that the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and proceed to the next iteration without executing any further statements within the current iteration. All the variables retain their previous values, and the condition that the current value of `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]` remains true.
