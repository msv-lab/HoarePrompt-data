Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime. A slime can only eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger. If no slime can eat any other slime, the process stops.

2. **Key Functions**:
   - **func_1**: This function finds the smallest index in the list `a` where the value is greater than or equal to `x`. If no such index exists, it returns -1.
   - **func_2**: This function calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. It uses two auxiliary lists: `left` for cumulative sums and `last` for storing the last occurrence index of each unique element.

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The main function processes each test case by calling `func_2` twice (once for the original list and once for the reversed list) and then taking the minimum or maximum of the results based on whether a value is -1.
   - `func_2` constructs the `left` list to store cumulative sums and the `last` list to track the last occurrence of each unique element.
   - For each slime, it checks if it can eat its left or right neighbor and updates the answer accordingly.

4. **Verification**:
   - The approach in `func_2` correctly identifies the minimum number of steps for each slime to be eaten by considering both directions (left and right).
   - The use of cumulative sums (`left`) and last occurrence indices (`last`) ensures that the algorithm efficiently determines the necessary steps.
   - The final step of comparing and combining results from `func_2` calls ensures that the most optimal path for each slime is chosen.

Given the detailed analysis, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
