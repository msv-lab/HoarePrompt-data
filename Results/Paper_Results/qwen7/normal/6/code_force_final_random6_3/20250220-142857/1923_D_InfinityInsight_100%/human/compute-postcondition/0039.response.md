Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[0]`, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to `inx2`. Given that `i` is 1, `last[i - 1]` is equivalent to `last[0]`. The other variables (`i`, `ans[1]`, `x`, and `inx`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
