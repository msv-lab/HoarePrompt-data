Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx2` is `last[0]`, `inx` is `last[0`**, and we continue the loop.

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables from the initial state, noting that the loop continues.
