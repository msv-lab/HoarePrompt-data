Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly identifies the smallest index in the list `a` where the value is greater than or equal to `x`. If no such index exists, it returns `-1`. This is a crucial part of determining whether a slime can eat another slime based on its size.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes `left` to store cumulative sums of the elements in `a`, and `last` to store the last occurrence index of each unique element in `a`.
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: It correctly calculates the cumulative sums and stores them in `left`.
   - **Processing Slimes**: For each slime, it checks if the current slime can eat the previous one. If it can, it calculates the number of operations required using the cumulative sums and the last occurrence index. The logic seems sound and aligns with the problem statement.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where a slime cannot eat any other slime by setting the result to `-1`.

3. **Main Program**:
   - **Symmetry Check**: It calls `func_2` twice, once on the original list and once on the reversed list, and then compares the results to ensure symmetry in the solution.
   - **Result Construction**: It constructs the final answer by taking the maximum of the two results for each slime, ensuring that the result is consistent regardless of the direction of the comparison.

Given the detailed analysis of each function and the main program, the overall logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
