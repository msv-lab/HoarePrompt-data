Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components' is the original value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components' plus 1 if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components' is the original value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components' plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components', and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size' is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'. `tree.vertices[u].good_components' remains unchanged.
