The loop condition is `while stack:`. This means the loop continues as long as the `stack` is not empty. To proceed to the next iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that the `stack` is still not empty.

Given the information about the loop body and the current state, no specific attributes of the vertices need to be adjusted for the loop to continue. The only thing that needs to be ensured is that the `stack` is not empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is simply the state of the `stack`.

State: **The `stack` is not empty**
