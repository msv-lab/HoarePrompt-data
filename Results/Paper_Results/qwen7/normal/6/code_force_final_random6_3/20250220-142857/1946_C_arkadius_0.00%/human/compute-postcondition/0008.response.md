Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `u` is an input integer
   - `v` is an integer obtained from input
   - An edge is added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree
   - `[u, v]` is a list containing integers obtained from input
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
