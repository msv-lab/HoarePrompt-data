To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions provided. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

### Analysis of Functions

1. **`func_1(tree: Tree, s: int, x: int) -> (int, int):`**
   - This function seems to traverse the tree using a post-order traversal.
   - It updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node.
   - However, the implementation of this function is incomplete and does not seem to correctly handle the logic required for the problem.

2. **`func_2(tree: Tree, v: int, x: int) -> (int, int):`**
   - This function is a recursive helper function to calculate the number of good components and remaining size for a subtree.
   - It calls itself recursively for each child of the current node.
   - It updates `good_components` and `remaining_size` based on the results from the subtrees.
   - This function is also incomplete and does not seem to correctly handle the logic required for the problem.

3. **`func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) -> bool:`**
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the number of good components and remaining size.
   - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the remaining size is at least `x` when the number of good components equals `k`.
   - This function is incomplete and does not seem to correctly handle the logic required for the problem.

4. **`func_4(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int) -> int:`**
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x`.
   - It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is valid.
   - This function is incomplete and does not seem to correctly handle the logic required for the problem.

5. **`func_5():`**
   - This function reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
   - The tree construction and root finding logic (`root_tree_non_recursive`) are missing.

### Conclusion

Given the incomplete and incorrect implementations of the functions, the provided program is not correct. The functions do not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
