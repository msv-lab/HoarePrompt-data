Output State: **The stack is now containing the pair `(v, True)`, `v` is the first element of the last pair popped from the stack, and `postorder` is the second element of the same pair.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((v, True))` appends a new pair `(v, True)` to the stack. This operation does not change the values of `v` or `postorder`, but it adds the new pair to the stack. Therefore, the stack now contains the pair `(v, True)`, while `v` and `postorder` retain their original values.
