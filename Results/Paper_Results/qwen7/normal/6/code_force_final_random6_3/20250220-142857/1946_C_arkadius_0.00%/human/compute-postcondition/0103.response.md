Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components' is the original value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components' plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components', and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size' is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'. `tree.vertices[u].good_components' remains unchanged.**

This means that the `remaining_size` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` has been updated to include the `remaining_size` of `tree.vertices[u]`. The `good_components` attributes of both vertices remain as per their initial states.
