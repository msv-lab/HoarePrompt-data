Output State: The loop will continue to execute until it has gone through all iterations from 1 to `n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` remains as the initial number of vertices, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from input for each iteration, and an edge is added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree for each pair of inputs provided. The final state of the tree will have `n-1` edges added to it, as `k` edges are removed from the initially created tree with `n` vertices.
