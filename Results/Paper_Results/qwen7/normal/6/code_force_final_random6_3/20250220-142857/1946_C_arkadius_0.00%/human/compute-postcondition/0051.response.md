Postcondition: **`stack` will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, the `stack` will include every vertex in the subtree starting from `v`, each represented as a tuple where the first element is the vertex and the second element is `False`. This applies regardless of whether the condition `not postorder` is true or false, as the else part does not change the stack and the if part ensures the stack is populated as described.
