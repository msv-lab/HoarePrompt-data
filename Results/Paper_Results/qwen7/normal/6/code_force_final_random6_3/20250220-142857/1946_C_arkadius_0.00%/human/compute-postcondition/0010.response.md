Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, there is an edge added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree.**

Explanation: The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
