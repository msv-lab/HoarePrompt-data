Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a tree (an instance of a tree structure), an integer n representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer k representing the number of edges to be removed (with 1 â‰¤ k < n). After processing, it returns an integer value of mid which is the same as both beg and end once they converge.**

This means the function takes a tree structure, along with the number of its vertices and the number of edges to be removed, and returns an integer that represents the converged value of `mid`, which is equal to both `beg` and `end`.
