Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, and `u` remains as the first child vertex of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is additionally increased by 1. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'`.
