You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure, n is the number of vertices in the tree (an integer), and k is the number of edges to be removed (an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n).
def func_4(tree, n, k):
    beg = 1
    end = n
    while beg < end:
        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `mid` is an integer. After all iterations of the loop, `beg` will be equal to `end`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `beg` and `end` until they converge, with `beg` being incremented and `end` being decremented based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. The final value of `mid` will be the same as `beg` and `end`, calculated as (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1 when `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true, or `beg` will be set to `mid` and `end` will be adjusted accordingly until they meet.
    return beg
    #The program returns the integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` after they converge.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: a tree (an instance of a tree structure), an integer n representing the number of vertices in the tree, and an integer k representing the number of edges to be removed (with 1 ≤ k < n). After processing, it returns an integer value of mid which is the same as both beg and end once they converge.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` after they converge.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
