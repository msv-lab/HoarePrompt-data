Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing specified edges. It processes the tree structure to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex, reflecting the cumulative count of good components and the total remaining size of all descendant components for the starting vertex `s`. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the number of good components for vertex `s` and the remaining size of all its descendant components.**
