Output State: **`stack` will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, (postorder) is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is equal to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.**

This means that the remaining size of vertex `v` in the tree has been updated to include the remaining size of vertex `u`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
