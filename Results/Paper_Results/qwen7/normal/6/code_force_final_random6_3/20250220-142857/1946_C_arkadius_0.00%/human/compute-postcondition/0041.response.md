Output State: **`stack` is now an empty list, `v` is the first element of the last tuple in the original `stack`, and `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in the original `stack`.**

Explanation: The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops the last tuple from the `stack` and assigns its elements to `v` and `postorder` respectively. After popping, `stack` becomes an empty list. The values of `v` and `postorder` are taken from the last tuple in the original `stack`.
