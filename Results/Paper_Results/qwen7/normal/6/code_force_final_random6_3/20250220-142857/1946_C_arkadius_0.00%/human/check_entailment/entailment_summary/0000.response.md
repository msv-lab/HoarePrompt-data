### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that we can remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree to ensure that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of all descendant components for a given starting vertex \( s \). It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex.
   - **func_2**: This function is a recursive helper function used by `func_1` to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - **func_3**: This function checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if the number of good components equals \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \).
   - **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the conditions checked by `func_3`.
   - **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to compute the result.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **func_1 and func_2**: These functions correctly traverse the tree and update the necessary attributes (`good_components` and `remaining_size`). They ensure that the calculations are done accurately for each subtree.
   - **func_3**: This function correctly checks the conditions for a given \( x \) using the results from `func_1`.
   - **func_4**: This function uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the conditions. The binary search is implemented correctly, and the convergence point is returned as the result.
   - **func_5**: This function correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to get the final result.

Given that all functions work correctly and together they solve the problem as described, the overall program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
