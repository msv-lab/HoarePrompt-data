Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until all `k` edges have been added to the tree. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and the tree will have `k` edges added between pairs of nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, where `u` and `v` are integers obtained from input. The function `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` is called, which does not directly modify the values of `i`, `n`, or `k`. It starts building the tree from node 0 with -1 as the parent (which is typical for root nodes). The conditions regarding the loop and the values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
