Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size', and `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is additionally increased by 1.**

This means that the `remaining_size` of `v` is now the original `remaining_size` of `v` plus the `remaining_size` of `u`. Also, the `good_components` of `v` is now the original `good_components` of `v` plus the `good_components` of `u`. Additionally, if the `remaining_size` of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the `good_components` of `v` is further incremented by 1.
