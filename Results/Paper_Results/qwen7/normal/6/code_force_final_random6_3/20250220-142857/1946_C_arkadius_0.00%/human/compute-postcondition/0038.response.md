Postcondition: `v` is an integer, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented for each child `u` of vertex `v` based on the following rules: 
- If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented by 1.
- If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be incremented by 1 plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.
Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` whenever `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
