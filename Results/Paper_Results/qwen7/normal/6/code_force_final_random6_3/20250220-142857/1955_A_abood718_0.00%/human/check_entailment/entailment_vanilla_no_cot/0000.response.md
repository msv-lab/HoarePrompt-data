Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts under the promotion conditions:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts**: The program does not handle the scenario where the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd. It incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) instead of the total cost when using the promotion.

2. **Redundant Print Statement**: There is an extra `print(X)` statement before calculating the final cost, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Logic for Even Number of Yogurts**: The logic for even numbers of yogurts is mostly correct, but the program should ensure that the total cost is calculated properly.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            # If the promotion is cheaper than buying individually
            print(A * B)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum cost for both scenarios
            cost_with_promotion = (A // 2) * C + (A % 2) * B
            cost_without_promotion = A * B
            print(min(cost_with_promotion, cost_without_promotion))

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts correctly and calculates the minimum cost accurately.
