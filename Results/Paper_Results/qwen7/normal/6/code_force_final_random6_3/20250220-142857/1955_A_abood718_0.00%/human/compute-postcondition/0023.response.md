Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1. This does not affect the values of `X`, `B`, or `C`, so we can ignore this detail.
   - `A'` is an integer input.
   - `B'` is an integer input.
   - `C'` is an integer input.
   - `X` is defined as `A'` divided by 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.

Given the initial state:
- `X = A' / 2`
- `B` is the integer input `B'`
- `C` is the integer input `C'`

Therefore, the expression inside the print statement becomes:
\[ \text{print}((A' / 2) * C' + B') \]

Since `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` are integer inputs, let's denote them as follows:
- Let `A' = a`
- Let `B' = b`
- Let `C' = c`

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[ \text{print}((a / 2) * c + b) \]

Since `a` is an integer, `a / 2` will either be an integer if `a` is even, or a float if `a` is odd. However, since `X` is defined as `A' / 2`, it implies that `a` must be an integer, and thus `X` will be an integer if `a` is even, or a float if `a` is odd. For simplicity and precision, we'll consider `X` as an integer division result.

Thus, the expression further simplifies to:
\[ \text{print}(\text{int}(a / 2) * c + b) \]

Given the format requirement, the output should be described precisely as:
Output: **(A' / 2) * C' + B' (where A', B', and C' are integer inputs)**
