Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, and b, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers between 1 and 100 and 1 and 30 respectively. The function returns a result based on the values of n, a, and b for each test case.**
