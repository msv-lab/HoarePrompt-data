Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `A` is the first integer entered.
- `B` is the second integer entered.
- `C` is the third integer entered.
- `B * 2 < C` holds true.
- `X` is `A // 2`.

The `print(X)` statement will print the value of `X`, which is the integer division of `A` by 2.

Therefore, the output will be the result of `A // 2`.

Output: **A // 2**
