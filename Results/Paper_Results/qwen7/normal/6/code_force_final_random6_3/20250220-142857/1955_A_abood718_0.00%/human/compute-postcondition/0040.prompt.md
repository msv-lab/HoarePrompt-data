Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
    if B * 2 < C:
        print(A * B)
    elif A % 2 == 0:
        print(int(A * C / 2))
    else:
        X = A // 2
        print(X)
        print(X * C + B)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `A` is the first integer entered, `B` is the second integer entered, and `C` is the third integer entered. If `B * 2 < C`, then `A` remains unchanged. If `B * 2 \geq C`, then if `A` is even, `A` remains unchanged; if `A` is odd, `B * 2 < C` holds true and `X` is set to `A // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` are integer inputs. If `B' * 2 < C'`, then the values of `A'`, `B'`, and `C'` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `A'` is even, `A'` remains unchanged. If `A'` is odd, `A'` is divided by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `A` is an input integer, `B` is an input integer, `C` is an input integer. If `B * 2 < C`, the condition does not specify any change to the variables. Otherwise, if `A` is even, `X` is set to `A // 2`; otherwise, `X` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
