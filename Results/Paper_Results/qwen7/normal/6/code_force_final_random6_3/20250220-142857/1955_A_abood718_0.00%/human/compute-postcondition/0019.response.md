Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the `print(A * B)` statement directly.
- `A'` is replaced by an integer input.
- `B'` is replaced by an integer input.
- `C'` is replaced by an integer input, but this variable is not used in the `print(A * B)` statement.

The `print(A * B)` statement will print the product of `A` and `B`.

Since `A` and `B` are explicitly stated to be integer inputs, we need to represent them as such in the output.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integer inputs)**
