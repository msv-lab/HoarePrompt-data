Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the case where `n` is odd and `B * 2 >= C`. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) instead of calculating the cost as `X * C + B`.

For example, if `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`, the correct output should be `15` (since it's cheaper to buy 2 yogurts for 11 burles and 1 yogurt for 5 burles). However, the program prints `3` because it calculates `X = 3 // 2 = 1` and then prints `X` without adding the remaining yogurt's price.

To fix this, the program should correctly handle the case where `A % 2 != 0` by ensuring it adds the price of the last yogurt after calculating the cost of the pairs.
