The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). It prints a result based on specific conditions involving these integers. Specifically, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). If \(A\) is odd, it calculates \(\frac{A}{2}\), prints it, and then prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) from the last test case, along with any previously printed intermediate results.
