Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are indices within the list `a` such that `r` is not decremented to a point where `l > r`, `sunks` is increased by 1, `k` is decreased by twice the value of `a[r]`, `a[l]` is decreased by the value of `a[r]`, and if `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `sunks += 1` simply increments the value of `sunks` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
