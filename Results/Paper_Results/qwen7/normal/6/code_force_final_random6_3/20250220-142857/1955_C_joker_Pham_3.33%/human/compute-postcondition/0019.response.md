Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 0, `r` is \(n - 1\), `sunks` is 1, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[l]\), `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and the condition `a[l] <= a[r]` is true.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` decreases the value of `a[r]` by the value of `a[l]`. Given that `a[l] <= a[r]` was initially true, the operation does not violate this condition. All other variables remain unchanged.
