Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 1, `r` is \(n - 2\), `sunks` is 3, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[r]\), and the current value of `a[r]` is less than the current value of `a[l]` and the condition `k >= a[r] * 2` is now false; `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`, and `a[l]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was \(n - 1\). After decrementing, `r` becomes \(n - 2\). All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
