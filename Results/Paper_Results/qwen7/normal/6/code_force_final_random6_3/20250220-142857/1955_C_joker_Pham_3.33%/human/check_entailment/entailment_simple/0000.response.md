Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and calls the `func_1` function with the appropriate parameters.
2. The `func_1` function initializes two pointers (`l` and `r`) at the start and end of the list `a`.
3. It iterates through the list, reducing the durability of the ships according to the specified rules and counting the number of sunk ships.
4. The logic within the function handles the following scenarios:
   - When both `l` and `r` point to the same ship and there are enough attacks left to sink it.
   - When the durability of the ship at `l` is less than or equal to the durability of the ship at `r`, and it performs the necessary reductions and checks.
   - When the durability of the ship at `r` is less than the durability of the ship at `l`, and it performs the necessary reductions and checks.
5. The function correctly breaks the loop and returns the total number of sunk ships once the conditions for further attacks are not met.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and correctly calculates the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

Correctness: **True**
