Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in the range from 1 to \(n\), `l` is 1, `r` is \(n - 2\), `sunks` is 3, `k` is reduced by \(2 \times a[0]\), and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` was initially set to 0 and was incremented by 1, making `l` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions and initial state.
