The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop context is provided in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `sunks` variable is increased by 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is a list of positive integers, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is unchanged. The operation `a[r] -= a[l]` is not executed because there is no loop or conditional statement that would trigger it. Additionally, `k` remains unchanged if `k == 0`.

Output State: **`sunks` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is a list of positive integers, `l` is increased by 1, `r` is unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged if `k == 0`.**
