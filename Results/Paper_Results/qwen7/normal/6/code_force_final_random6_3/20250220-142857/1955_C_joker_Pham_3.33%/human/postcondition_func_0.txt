The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the length of the list `a`), `k` (an integer representing the available operations), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It processes the list `a` by performing valid operations based on the value of `k` and counts the total number of valid operations performed. The function returns `sunks`, which is the total count of these valid operations. Additionally, it returns the final values of `l` and `r`, which indicate the remaining bounds of the unprocessed elements in the list, and `k`, which represents the remaining value after all possible operations have been attempted.
