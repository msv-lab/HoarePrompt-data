Output State: **`sunks` is increased by 1; `r` is decreased by 1 and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `sunks` and `r` remain as they were before the `continue` statement was executed, but the loop will continue to the next iteration.
