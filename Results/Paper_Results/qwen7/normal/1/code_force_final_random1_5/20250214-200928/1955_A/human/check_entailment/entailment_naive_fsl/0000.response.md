Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is cheaper than buying individually, especially when the total number of yogurts `A` is odd. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
- The program checks if `B * 2 < C`, which is `5 * 2 < 11` (True), so it prints `A * B` which is `3 * 5 = 15`.
- However, the optimal solution is to buy one yogurt at `B` and the remaining two at `C`, resulting in `5 + 11 = 16`.

The program fails to account for this scenario, leading to incorrect results in cases where buying in pairs is more cost-effective.
