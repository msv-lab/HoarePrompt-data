Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, a, and b where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. It does not return any value explicitly based on the given information.**

However, since the problem statement mentions processing these values but does not specify a return type or behavior, the focus should be on the input constraints and expected processing rather than a return value.
