Output State: **`i` is 2, `A` is an integer entered by the user that must be greater than 1, `B` is an integer entered by the user, `C` is an integer entered by the user, and `X` is not defined**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 2. The variable `X` is not defined and remains undefined. The conditions for `A` and `B` and `C` being integers entered by the user remain valid.
