Output: **int(user_input_A * user_input_C / 2)**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `A` is an integer entered by the user.
- `B` is an integer entered by the user.
- `C` is an integer entered by the user.
- The print statement calculates `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the integer division of the product of `A` and `C` by 2. Since `A` and `C` are integers entered by the user, the result of `A * C / 2` will also be an integer after performing the division and converting it to an integer using `int()`.
