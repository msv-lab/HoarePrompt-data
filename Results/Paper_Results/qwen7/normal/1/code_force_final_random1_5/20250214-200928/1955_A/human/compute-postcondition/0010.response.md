Output State: **`i` is 0, `A` is an integer entered by the user, `B` is an integer entered by the user, `C` is an integer entered by the user, and `B * 2` is greater than `C`; `X` is `A` divided by 2 using integer division.**

Explanation: The code `X = A // 2` assigns the value of `A` divided by 2 (using integer division) to the variable `X`. The values of `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `B * 2 > C` also remains valid.
