Postcondition: `i` is 1, `A` is an integer entered by the user, `B` is an integer entered by the user, `C` is an integer entered by the user, and either `B * 2 < C` is true, in which case the postcondition remains as the initial state, or `X` is `A` // 2 if `A` is even, or `X` is not defined if `A` is odd.
