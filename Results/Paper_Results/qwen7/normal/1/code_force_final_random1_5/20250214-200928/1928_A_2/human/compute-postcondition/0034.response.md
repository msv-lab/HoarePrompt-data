Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first input integer from the split, `b` is the second input integer from the split.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if condition `(a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0)` is checked, and if it is true, the program fragment inside the if block does not change the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, or `b`. Similarly, if the if condition is false, the else block does not change these values either. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states specified in the precondition.
