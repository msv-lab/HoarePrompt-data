### Reasoning:

The original assessment is inaccurate due to several logical errors in the program. Let's break down the issues and provide a corrected version of the program.

#### Issues in the Original Program:
1. **Redundant and Incorrect Conditions**:
   - The condition `if (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect and redundant. It should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is zero, which would mean the rectangle is a square and cannot form a different rectangle.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect and redundant. It should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, which means a new rectangle can be formed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of "No" Output**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the conditions for printing 'no'. It should print 'no' if none of the above conditions for 'yes' are met, but the current logic does not cover all cases correctly.

#### Correct Conditions:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into a different rectangle if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  - Both dimensions are even.
  - One dimension is exactly double the other (i.e., `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`).

#### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, we can always form a new rectangle by cutting them into smaller even-sized rectangles.
- If one dimension is exactly double the other, it means the rectangle is a multiple of a smaller rectangle, and no new distinct rectangle can be formed.
- In all other cases, a new rectangle can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the solution. The revised program addresses these issues and correctly determines if Bob can obtain another rectangle.

**Correctness:** False

Final: **False**
