Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `t` is a new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first input integer from the split.
- `b` is the second input integer from the split.

The `print('no')` statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
