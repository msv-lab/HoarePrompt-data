Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `t` is a new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first input integer from the split.
- `b` is the second input integer from the split.

The `print('yes')` statement simply prints the string 'yes'. Since no values for `t`, `a`, or `b` are needed to determine the output of this specific print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **yes**
