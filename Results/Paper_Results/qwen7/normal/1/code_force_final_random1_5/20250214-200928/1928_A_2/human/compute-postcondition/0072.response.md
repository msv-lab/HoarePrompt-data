Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it does not return a specific value directly but processes the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` according to some unspecified logic within the function body.**

Note: The exact logic for processing `t`, `a`, and `b` is not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the input constraints and the fact that the function processes these inputs without explicitly stating the outcome.
