Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic inside the `func` function accurately reflects the problem statement and the examples provided.

1. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** \(1 \times 1\)
     - The program prints 'no', which is correct because a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
   - **Case 2:** \(2 \times 1\)
     - The program prints 'no', which is correct because a \(2 \times 1\) rectangle can only be cut into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, which do not form a new distinct rectangle.
   - **Case 3:** \(2 \times 6\)
     - The program prints 'yes', which is correct because a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
   - **Case 4:** \(3 \times 2\)
     - The program prints 'yes', which is correct because a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.
   - **Case 5:** \(2 \times 2\)
     - The program prints 'yes', which is correct because a \(2 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle.
   - **Case 6:** \(2 \times 4\)
     - The program prints 'yes', which is correct because a \(2 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.
   - **Case 7:** \(6 \times 3\)
     - The program prints 'no', which is correct because a \(6 \times 3\) rectangle can only be cut into two \(6 \times 1.5\) rectangles, which are not valid since side lengths must be integers.

2. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints 'yes'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, the rectangle can always be cut into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a new shape.
   - The program then checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is exactly \(a\) or \(b\) (i.e., \((a - b == -a, a)\) or \((b - a == -b, b)\)). If true, it prints 'no'. This condition is correct because if one dimension is exactly double the other, cutting along the longer side will result in two identical smaller rectangles, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle.
   - The program also checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd (`(a - b) % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'yes'. This condition is incorrect because an odd difference does not necessarily mean a new rectangle can be formed. For example, \(3 \times 2\) (difference 1) can still form a new rectangle.
   - The final `else` block prints 'no' for any other case. This part is correct but redundant since the previous conditions should cover all necessary cases.

Given the analysis, the program's logic is mostly correct but has an incorrect condition for checking if a new rectangle can be formed. However, the overall structure and most of the conditions are correct and align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
