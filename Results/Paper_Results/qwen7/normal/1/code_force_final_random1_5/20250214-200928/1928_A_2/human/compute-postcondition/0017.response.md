Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 0 (this will change in the next iteration).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs based on the value of `i`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run for `int(input())` times.

3. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented from its current value. Given that `i` starts at 0, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.

4. **Input for Next Iteration**: The loop body is omitted, but it is implied that the loop will take another input for `t` (which is the number of iterations).

5. **New State After First Iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `t` will be the new input integer (since `t` is read at the start of each iteration).

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.
