Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `a1` equals `a2` which are both `a/2`, `b1` equals `b2` which are both `b//2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, then `t` is greater than 0, `a` is `a/2`, and `b` is `b//2`; otherwise, `t` is greater than 0 - 1, `a` and `b` remain their original input values.
