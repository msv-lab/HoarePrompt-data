Output State: **i is 3, t is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), a is the first input integer from the split, b is the second input integer from the split.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `3` because the loop runs for each input test case, and since we are considering the state after all iterations, `i` would have incremented to `3`. The variable `t` will be updated to the value of the next input integer, ensuring it still satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Similarly, `a` and `b` will hold the values from the split input for the current test case. All other variables outside the loop remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
