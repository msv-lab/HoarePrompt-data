Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` equals `a2` which are both `a/2`, `b1` equals `b2` which are both `b//2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `b // 2` to both `b1` and `b2`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `a1`, `a2`, or `b`. The only new information is that `b1` and `b2` are both set to `b // 2`. The conditions and relationships between `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
