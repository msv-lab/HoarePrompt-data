Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and `a` is divided by 2 to get `a1` and `a2`. If `a1` is not equal to `b`, the loop continues (though the loop's continuation is not detailed in the postcondition). If `a1` is equal to `b`, the loop does not continue.
