Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and neither \(a - b = -a\) nor \(b - a = -b\). If the difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to zero and is odd, the condition remains unchanged. If the difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition remains unchanged as well.**
