Output: **No**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 0 - 1, which simplifies to `t > -1`. Since `t` is greater than -1, it means `t` is at least 0.
- Variables `a` and `b` are described as integers from the input, but their specific values are not provided.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `a` and `b`, and only outputs the fixed string `'No'`, the output is simply **No**.
