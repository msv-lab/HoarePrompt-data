Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` is an integer from the input, `a2` is an integer from the input, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`, we continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or perform any operations. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
