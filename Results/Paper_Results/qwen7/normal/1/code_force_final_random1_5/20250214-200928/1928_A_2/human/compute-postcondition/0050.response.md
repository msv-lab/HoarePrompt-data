Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. If `a` or `b` is even, `a1` is an integer from the input, `a2` is an integer from the input, `b1` is half of `b`, `b2` is half of `b`. If `b1` is equal to `a`, the loop does not continue. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, we continue the loop or process. If `a` or `b` is not even, `t` remains greater than 0 - 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input.
