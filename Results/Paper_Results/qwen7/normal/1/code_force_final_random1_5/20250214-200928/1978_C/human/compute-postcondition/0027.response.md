Output State: **The program returns the result of the function call `func_3(3, l)`, where `l` is the value of `i` which is `n - 5`.**

Given the initial state:
- `c` is 3
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `i` is `n - 5`
- `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`
- `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`

The code snippet provided only returns `l`, which is the result of the function call `func_3(c, l)`. Since `c` is 3, the function call becomes `func_3(3, l)`. The value of `l` is determined by the expression `i`, which is `n - 5`. Therefore, the final output is the result of the function `func_3(3, n - 5)`.
