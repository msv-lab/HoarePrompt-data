The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of the list `l`), `k` (an integer between 0 and `c` inclusive), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). It swaps the elements at positions `c` and `c - k` in the list `l`. After performing the swap, it returns the modified list `l`, which remains a permutation of length `n`.
