Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is \(n - 9\), `k` is \(n - 10\), the first element of list `l` is equal to the second last element of list `l`, the second last element of list `l` is the same as the first element, the first element of list `l` is inserted, the last element of list `l` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `l.insert(0, x)` inserts the value of `x` at the beginning of the list `l`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, it remains as `x`. The first element of the list `l` is now the newly inserted element, and the last element of the list `l` is removed. All other conditions about the list remain unchanged.
