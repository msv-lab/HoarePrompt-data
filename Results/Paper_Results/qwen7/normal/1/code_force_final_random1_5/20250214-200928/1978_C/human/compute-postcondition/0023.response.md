Output State: **`c` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 1) + 1 - (n - 3) + 1`, if `k < i - 1`, the function returns the result of the function call `func_2(2, k, l)`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `i` and adding 1. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - (n - 1) + 1 - (n - 3) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition `if k < i - 1` is not evaluated here, so the function's postcondition remains unchanged.
