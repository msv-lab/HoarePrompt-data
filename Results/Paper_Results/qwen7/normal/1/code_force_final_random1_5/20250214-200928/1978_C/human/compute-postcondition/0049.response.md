Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). It returns a modified list `l` based on specific conditions. If `k` becomes 0 before processing all elements, it returns the current list `l`. Otherwise, it reverses the list `l` by moving its elements to the front or back based on the value of `k`. The final state of the list `l` will be either fully reversed or partially modified according to the value of `k`.**
