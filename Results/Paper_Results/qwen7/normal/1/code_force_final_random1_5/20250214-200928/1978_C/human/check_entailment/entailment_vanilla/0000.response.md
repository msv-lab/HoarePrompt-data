### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`. The Manhattan value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between each element of the permutation and its index.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. It iteratively modifies the list `l` by swapping elements to achieve the desired value.
   - **func_2() and func_3()**: These functions swap specific elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation if a solution exists.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the process by calling other functions and handling the input/output.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The approach in `func_1()` involves constructing the permutation by making strategic swaps to minimize the deviation from the target Manhattan value.
   - The functions `func_2()` and `func_3()` handle the swapping logic, which is crucial for achieving the exact Manhattan value.
   - The overall structure of the code seems to follow the problem requirements correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The construction of the permutation is done in a way that ensures the final Manhattan value matches the target.

5. **Verification**:
   - Given the complexity of the problem, the provided functions seem to cover all necessary aspects to solve the problem correctly.
   - The code logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.

**Correctness: True**
