### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value equals `k`.
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4**: This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is odd or the maximum possible value is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - **func_1**: This function attempts to construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly generate permutations for all valid `k` values.
   - **func_2 & func_3**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value, but they do not cover all necessary cases and may not produce a valid permutation.
   - **func_5**: Prints the permutation if found.
   - **func_6**: Main function that orchestrates the process.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The Manhattan value is always even because each term \( |p_i - i| \) is either even or odd, and their sum must be even.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) if `n` is odd, and \( \frac{n^2}{2} \) if `n` is even.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - **func_4**: Correctly checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to `n` and attempts to adjust the Manhattan value by swapping elements. However, the logic for adjusting the Manhattan value is incomplete and does not guarantee a valid permutation for all `k` values.
   - **func_2 & func_3**: These functions swap elements to adjust the Manhattan value, but they do not cover all necessary cases and may not produce a valid permutation.
   - **func_5 & func_6**: Correctly handle the output format.

5. **Testing Specific Cases:**
   - For small values of `n` and `k`, the function should produce correct results.
   - For larger values, the function may fail to produce a valid permutation due to the flawed logic in `func_1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the function correctly returns "NO".
   - When `k` is even and within the possible range, the function should return a valid permutation. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this for all cases.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the implementation is not fully correct. The function `func_1` does not guarantee that a valid permutation will be generated for all valid `k` values. There are edge cases where the function may fail to produce a valid permutation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
