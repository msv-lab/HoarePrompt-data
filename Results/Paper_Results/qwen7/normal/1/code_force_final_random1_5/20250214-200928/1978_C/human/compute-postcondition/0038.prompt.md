You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: Output State: `c` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 2 * (number_of_iterations - 1)`, `k` is reduced by the sum of all `i` values minus the number of iterations plus 1, and `l` is the result of repeatedly applying `func_3(c, l)` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `c` will be the total number of times the loop ran, which is determined by the value of `n` and how many times the loop condition `range(n, -1, -2)` holds true. The variable `i` will be `n` minus twice the number of iterations minus 2. The variable `k` will be reduced by the sum of all `i` values minus the number of iterations plus 1. Finally, `l` will be the result of repeatedly applying `func_3(c, l)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). Depending on the conditions and the calls to other functions, the function returns either the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is 1 or 2, or the result of `func_3(3, l)`, with `l` being either undefined or derived from `i` which is `n - 5`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a variable 'l', but 'l' is not defined in the given code snippet.

Case_2: The program returns the result of calling `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is 1, `k` is not 0, and `l` is not specified in the initial state.

Case_3: The program returns a variable 'l', but 'l' is not defined in the given code snippet or initial state.

Case_4: The program returns the result of the function call `func_2(2, k, l)` where `k` is adjusted from its initial value as `k - (n - 1) + 1` and `l` is not defined, hence the function's postcondition remains unchanged.

Case_5: The program returns the result of the function call `func_3(3, l)`, where `l` is the value of `i` which is `n - 5`.

Case_6: The program returns the result of `func_2(3, k, i)` where `k` is updated based on the value of `i` (which is `n - 5`), and `i` is `n - 5` with `n` being an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
