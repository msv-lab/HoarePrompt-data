Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No

    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive. It processes these inputs through a series of operations, including updating `k` and calling other functions (`func_2` and `func_3`). Depending on the conditions met during its execution, it may return either the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` with `c` being 1 or 2, or the result of `func_3(3, l)`. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, it returns `l` directly. The final state of the program includes the count of loop iterations (`c`), the adjusted value of `k`, and the transformed list `l` resulting from repeated applications of `func_3`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of the list `l`), `k` (an integer between 0 and `c` inclusive), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). It swaps the elements at positions `c` and `c - k` in the list `l`. After performing the swap, it returns the modified list `l`, which remains a permutation of length `n`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts two parameters: `c`, a positive integer within the range 1 to half the length of the list `l`, and `l`, a list of integers representing a permutation. It returns the list `l` with the elements at index `c - 1` and `-c` swapped.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is divisible by 2. If \( k \) is not divisible by 2, it returns two zeros (0, 0). If \( k \) is divisible by 2, it calculates a maximum value \( max_k \) based on \( n \). If \( max_k \) is less than \( k \), it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing a valid permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of this permutation is equal to `k`. It prints "YES" followed by each element of the list `l` on the same line separated by spaces. After executing the loop, it prints a newline character. The function does not return any value.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function does not accept any parameters. It first calls `func_4()` to get values for `n` and `k`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and does not return any value. Otherwise, it calculates a value `l` using `func_1(n, k)` and then processes `l` using `func_5(l)`. Finally, it returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_5(func_1(n, k))` if `n` is not 0.
