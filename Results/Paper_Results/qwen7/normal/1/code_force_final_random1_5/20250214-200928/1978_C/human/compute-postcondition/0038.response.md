Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive. It processes these inputs through a series of operations, including updating `k` and calling other functions (`func_2` and `func_3`). Depending on the conditions met during its execution, it may return either the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` with `c` being 1 or 2, or the result of `func_3(3, l)`. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, it returns `l` directly. The final state of the program includes the count of loop iterations (`c`), the adjusted value of `k`, and the transformed list `l` resulting from repeated applications of `func_3`.**
