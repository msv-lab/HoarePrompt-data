Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `balance` is either 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or `balance_info.balance` - 1 if `s[0]` is not an opening parenthesis ('('). `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with the updated `balance` value, `i` value equal to 0, and `s[0]` value.
