Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `balance` is `balance_info.balance` - 1; the character at index `i` in string `s` is not an opening parenthesis ('(').**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Since `balance_info` was previously an instance containing `balance`, `i`, and the character at index `i` in `s`, the only change is to the `balance` attribute of `balance_info`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
