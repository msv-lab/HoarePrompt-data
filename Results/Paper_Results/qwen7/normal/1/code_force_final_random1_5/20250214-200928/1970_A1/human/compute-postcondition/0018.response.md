Output State: **`balance_info` now contains four instances: the first instance is `balance` of 1 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise -1; `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the second instance is updated `balance` (1 if `s[0]` is '(', 0 if `s[0]` is not '('); `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the third instance is new `balance`, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` value; `i` is 1.**

This means that the `balance_info` list has been appended with a new instance containing the current `balance`, the value of `i` which is 1, and the value of `s[1]`. The previous three instances in `balance_info` remain unchanged.
