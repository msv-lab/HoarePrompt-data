Output State: `balance_info` now contains `n` instances of `BalanceInfo`. Each instance has the following attributes:
- The `balance` value starts from 0 and changes based on the parentheses encountered during the iteration.
- The `i` value ranges from 0 to `n-1`, indicating the position of each character in the string `s`.
- The `s[i]` value is the character at position `i` in the string `s`.

In summary, `balance_info` will contain one entry for each index in the string `s`, with each entry reflecting the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string. The `balance` attribute will show the net count of open parentheses minus closed ones at each step, starting from 0 at the beginning of the string and updating with each iteration through the loop.
