The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects containing `balance` and `position` attributes. Depending on whether the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` are equal, the function returns either the difference between their `balance` values or the difference between their `position` values. Both `balance` and `position` are integers representing the balance and position of characters in a balanced parentheses sequence, respectively.
