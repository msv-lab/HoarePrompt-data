Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `balance` is 0, `balance_info` now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo` with the first instance having the initial `balance` value (either 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or -1 if `s[0]` is not '('), `i` value of 0, and `s[0]` value, and the second instance having the updated `balance` value of 0, `i` value of 0, and `s[0]` value, and a new `BalanceInfo` instance is appended to the list with the current `balance` of 0, `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value.
