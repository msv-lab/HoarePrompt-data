Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Balanced Shuffle Operation:**
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves computing the balance of each prefix of the input string.
   - These balances and their corresponding positions are stored in a list.
   - The list is then sorted based on the balance values (in ascending order) and, in case of ties, by position (in descending order).
   - The final sorted list is used to construct the shuffled sequence.

2. **Given Code Breakdown:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It returns the difference in balance or the difference in position if the balances are equal.
     - This function is not actually used in the main logic but seems to be part of the class definition or an auxiliary function.

   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function is the main function that performs the balanced shuffle operation.
     - It initializes the necessary variables and constructs a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - It sorts this list using a custom key function that sorts by balance (ascending) and position (descending).
     - Finally, it constructs the result string from the sorted list and prints it.

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is not defined in the provided code, so let's assume it is defined elsewhere with the appropriate attributes (`balance`, `position`, and `character`).
   - The sorting key function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)` ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when there is a tie.
   - The result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which should give the desired shuffled sequence.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It computes the balance of each prefix, sorts them according to the specified rules, and constructs the shuffled sequence.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
