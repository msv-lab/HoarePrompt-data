Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `balance` is either 1 or 0, `balance_info` now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo` with the first instance having either a `balance` of 1 (if `s[0]` is '(') or -1 (if `s[0]` is not '('), `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value, and the second instance having the updated `balance` (which is 1 if `s[0]` is '(' or 0 if `s[0]` is not '('), `i` of 0, and `s[0]` value, and a new `BalanceInfo` instance is appended to the list with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]` values.
