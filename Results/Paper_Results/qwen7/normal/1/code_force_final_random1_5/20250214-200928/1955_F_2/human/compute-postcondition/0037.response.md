Postcondition: `a` is updated to a list of integers from input, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the updated `a`, and the remaining number of iterations is the input value minus 1. If `a[0]` equals `a[1]` equals `a[2]` and `a[0]` is an odd number, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.
