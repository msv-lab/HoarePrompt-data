Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `p`**:
   - Since `p` contains the nearest even numbers to the corresponding input integers, let's consider an example to understand its behavior.
   - If the input integers were `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `p` would be `[2, 2, 4, 4, 6]`.

2. **`p[:3]`**:
   - This slice of `p` takes the first three elements of the list `p`.
   - For example, if `p = [2, 2, 4, 4, 6]`, then `p[:3] = [2, 2, 4]`.

3. **`map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])`**:
   - This applies a lambda function to each element of `p[:3]` to check if it is odd.
   - For `p[:3] = [2, 2, 4]`, the result of `map` would be `[False, False, False]` because all elements are even.

4. **`list(map(...))`**:
   - Converts the map object to a list, resulting in `[False, False, False]`.

5. **`sum([False, False, False])`**:
   - The sum of a list of booleans is the count of `True` values. Here, it is `0`.

6. **`(sum(list(map(...))) == 3)`**:
   - This evaluates to `(0 == 3)`, which is `False`.

7. **`sum(p)`**:
   - The sum of the list `p`. For example, if `p = [2, 2, 4, 4, 6]`, then `sum(p) = 18`.

8. **`sum(p) // 2`**:
   - Divides the sum by 2, resulting in `18 // 2 = 9`.

9. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `(False) + 9`, which simplifies to `9`.

### Conclusion:
The final output of the print statement is `9`.

Output: **9**
