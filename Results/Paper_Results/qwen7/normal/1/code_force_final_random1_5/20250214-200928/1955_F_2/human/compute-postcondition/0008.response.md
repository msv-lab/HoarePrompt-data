Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `p[:3]`**:
   - `p[:3]` refers to the first three elements of the list `p`.

2. **`lambda x: x % 2 > 0`**:
   - This lambda function checks if an integer `x` is odd (i.e., `x % 2` is 1).

3. **`list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))`**:
   - This applies the lambda function to each of the first three elements of `p`, resulting in a list of boolean values indicating whether each of these elements is odd.

4. **`sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`**:
   - This sums up the boolean values from the previous step. Since `True` is treated as 1 and `False` as 0, this gives the count of odd numbers among the first three elements of `p`.

5. **Condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)`**:
   - This checks if there are exactly three odd numbers among the first three elements of `p`. Given that there are only three elements being checked, this condition will always evaluate to `False` because it's impossible to have three odd numbers in a list of three elements (since each element is the nearest even number to the input integer, they cannot all be odd).

6. **`sum(p)`**:
   - This calculates the sum of all elements in the list `p`.

7. **`sum(p) // 2`**:
   - This performs integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.

8. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `(False) + (sum(p) // 2)`.
   - Since `False` is equivalent to `0` in Python, the expression simplifies to `0 + (sum(p) // 2)`, which is just `sum(p) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the sum of the elements in `p` is taken and then divided by 2. Since the exact values of the elements in `p` are not specified, the output will be the integer division of the sum of the elements in `p` by 2.

Output: **sum(p) // 2 (where sum(p) is the sum of all elements in the list p)**
