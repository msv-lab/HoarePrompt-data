Output State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 3, `not_c` is False.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(set_) - 1`. Given that `set_` is initially `[1]`, the length of `set_` is 1. Therefore, the loop will never execute because the range starts from 1 and goes up to the length of `set_` (which is 1), meaning there is no valid `i` that satisfies the condition `1 <= i < len(set_)`.

However, based on the provided output states after each iteration, we can infer the behavior:

- After the first iteration, `A` toggles to `True`, `not_c` becomes `False`, and `i` is updated to 1.
- After the second iteration, `A` toggles back to `False`, `not_c` remains `False`, and `i` is updated to 2.
- After the third iteration, `A` toggles back to `True`, `not_c` remains `False`, and `i` is updated to 2, but since the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is always false for the given `set_`, we do not increment `i` further.

Since the loop does not execute any more iterations beyond the third one due to the condition being false, the final state remains as after the third iteration.
