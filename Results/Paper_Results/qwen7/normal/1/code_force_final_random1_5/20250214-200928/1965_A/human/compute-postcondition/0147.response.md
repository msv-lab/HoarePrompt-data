Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it first checks if the smallest integer is 1 and if the list contains only one unique element. If either condition is met, it prints 'Alice'. Otherwise, it sorts and removes duplicate elements from the list, then determines whether the difference between consecutive unique elements is greater than 1. Based on the parity of the position of the first occurrence of such a gap and the length of the resulting sorted unique list, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The function ultimately prints the winner for each test case.**
