Output State: **`test` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` in `lis` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1 depending on whether `j` is odd or even.**

The value of `test` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
