Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues if `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a map object created from integers split from input.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`.
   - If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, then the postcondition remains as the initial state. Otherwise, `j` is 3, `test` is True, and the length of `lis` is at least 4.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `t` must be greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `t > 0`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

6. **Final state**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
   - `l` is a map object created from integers split from input (unchanged).
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` (unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`.**
