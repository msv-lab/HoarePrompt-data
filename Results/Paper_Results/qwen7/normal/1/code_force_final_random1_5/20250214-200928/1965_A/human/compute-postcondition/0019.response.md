Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(set_)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `A` is False
   - `arr[0]` is 1
   - `set_` is [1]
   - `i` is 2
   - `not_c` is False

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, len(set_))`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(set_)`.

4. **Update the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `set_` is [1], so `len(set_)` is 1.
   - Since `i` (which is 2) is not less than `len(set_)` (which is 1), the loop does not execute.

Given this analysis, the loop does not execute because `i` is not less than `len(set_)`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time since it won't run due to the condition failing.

**Final State**:
- No changes are needed for the loop to execute one more time as it does not meet the condition to run.

**Answer**:
State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False**
