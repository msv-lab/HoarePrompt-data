Output State: **A is False; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]** 

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a set from the list `arr` and then converts it back to a list. Since `arr[0]` is 1 and assuming `arr` only contains the element 1 (as no other elements are mentioned), the set will contain only the element 1. Converting this set back to a list results in a list containing the single element 1. The variable `A` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `False`.
