Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `j` is less than `len(lis)`**.

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because the conditions and variables involved do not change within the if-else block. The if-else structure ensures that regardless of whether the condition `j % 2 == 1` is true or false, the specified conditions on the variables `t`, `i`, `l`, `lis`, `test`, and `j` remain unchanged.
