Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is 1 (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input (unchanged).
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements (unchanged).
- `test` is False (unchanged).
- `j` is updated to `j + 1` (updated).

The print statement is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'Bob'` without referencing any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, the output will simply be the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
