#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: A is False, arr[0] is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 3, `not_c` is False.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(set_) - 1`. Given that `set_` is initially `[1]`, the length of `set_` is 1. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i = 0`, which means it won't actually run at all because the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) 1. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the loop has been executed 3 times. Since the loop breaks when `not_c` becomes False and `A` toggles with each iteration, after 3 iterations, `A` would be True (since it started as False and toggled 3 times), `i` would be 2 (as the loop increments `i` but stops before reaching the next index), and `not_c` remains False. The array `arr` and set `set_` do not change during the loop, so they remain as initially stated.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing the number of stones in each pile. It checks if the first element of `arr` is not 1, in which case it returns 'Alice'. If the first element is 1, it processes the unique sorted elements of `arr`. After processing, it returns 'Alice' if a certain condition is met, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
