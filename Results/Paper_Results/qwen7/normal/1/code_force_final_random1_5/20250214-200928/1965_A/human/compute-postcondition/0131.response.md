Postcondition: **`test` remains False, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number, and `j` is less than `len(lis)`. If the condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
