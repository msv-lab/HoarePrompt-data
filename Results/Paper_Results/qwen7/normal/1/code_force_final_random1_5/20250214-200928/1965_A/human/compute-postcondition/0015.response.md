Output State: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect any variable values but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their initial states.
