Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`**.

Explanation: The code `lis = sorted(set(l))` sorts and removes duplicates from the map object `l`. Since `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` will now be a sorted list of unique elements from `l`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
