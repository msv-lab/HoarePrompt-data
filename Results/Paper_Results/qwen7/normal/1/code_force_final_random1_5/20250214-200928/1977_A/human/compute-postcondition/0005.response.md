Output: **Yes**

Explanation: According to the initial state, the variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, but it is not relevant to the `print` statement. The variable `i` is set to 0, and `n` and `m` are both set to the same value from their respective inputs. The `print` statement simply outputs the string 'Yes', regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`.
