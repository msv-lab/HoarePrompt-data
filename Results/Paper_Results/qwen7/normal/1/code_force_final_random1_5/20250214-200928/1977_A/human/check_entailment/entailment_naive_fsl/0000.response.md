Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so the total number of cubes `m` after `n` moves should always have the same parity (odd/even) as `n`. 

For example, if `n` is even and `m` is odd, or if `n` is odd and `m` is even, the program incorrectly prints "Yes" because it does not check this parity condition. This can be demonstrated with the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  4 3
  5 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  No
  No
  ```

However, the program outputs:
```
Yes
Yes
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle cases where the parity of `n` and `m` do not match, making the program incorrect.
