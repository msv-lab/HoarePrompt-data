Output: **No**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, but none of the variables `i`, `n`, or `m` are printed in the given code snippet. The only `print` statement provided is `print('No')`, which directly prints the string 'No'. Therefore, the output is simply 'No'.
