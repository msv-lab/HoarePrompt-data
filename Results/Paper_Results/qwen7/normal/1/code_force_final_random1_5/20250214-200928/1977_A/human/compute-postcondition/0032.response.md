Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split, `m` is less than or equal to `n`. If `m` equals `n - 1`, then `m` remains as `n - 1`. Otherwise, `m` is not equal to `n - 1`, and in this case, both `m` and `n` are either both even or both odd.
