Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers from the first and second split respectively, and they are assigned the values from the input split. If `n` equals `m`, no changes are made to `n` and `m`. Otherwise, if both `m` and `n` are even, no changes are made to `m` and `n`. If at least one of `m` or `n` is odd, no changes are made to `m` and `n`.
