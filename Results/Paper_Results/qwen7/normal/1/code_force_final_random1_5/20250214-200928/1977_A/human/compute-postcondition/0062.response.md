Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers from the first and second split respectively, and they are assigned the values from the input split. If both `m` and `n` are even, `m` remains unchanged and `n` remains unchanged. If at least one of `m` or `n` is odd, `m` and `n` remain unchanged.**
