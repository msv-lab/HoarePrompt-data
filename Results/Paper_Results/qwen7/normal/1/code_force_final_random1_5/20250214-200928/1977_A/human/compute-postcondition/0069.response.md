Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, i is t-1, n and m are the last input integers from the final split. If n equals m, no changes are made to n and m. If m is greater than n, no changes are made to n and m. If m equals n - 1, no changes are made to n and m. In all other cases, no changes are made to n and m.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will hold the number of iterations the loop ran, which is the initial value of `t`. The variable `i` will be `t-1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `t-1`. The variables `n` and `m` will be the values of the last input integers provided during any iteration of the loop, and their state (whether they are equal, `m` is greater, `m` is `n-1`, or both are even/both are odd) will determine the output of the last iteration but will not change the values of `n` and `m` themselves.
