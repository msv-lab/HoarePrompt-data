Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible scenarios where Nikita can build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the conditions used in the `if-elif` chain do not cover all valid cases.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. **Case `n == m`:**
   - This condition is correct. If `n` equals `m`, then Nikita can simply add one cube at a time until he has `m` cubes.

2. **Case `m > n`:**
   - This condition is incorrect. It should be handled by checking if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. If `n - m` is even, then Nikita can remove cubes from the tower to achieve `m` cubes.

3. **Case `m == n - 1`:**
   - This condition is also incorrect. It should be checked if the difference between `n` and `m` is 1, which means Nikita can add one cube and then remove one cube to achieve `m` cubes.

4. **Case `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are even, but it does not cover all scenarios where `n` and `m` can be achieved.

5. **Case `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:**
   - This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are odd, but it does not cover all scenarios where `n` and `m` can be achieved.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This solution checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even, which covers all valid scenarios.
