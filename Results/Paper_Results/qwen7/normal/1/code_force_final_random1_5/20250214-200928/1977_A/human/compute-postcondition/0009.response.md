Output: **No**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, and `m` is an input integer from the second split with the condition that `m` is greater than `n`. The print statement simply outputs the string 'No'. Since no other variables are involved in this print statement, the output remains as the string 'No'.
