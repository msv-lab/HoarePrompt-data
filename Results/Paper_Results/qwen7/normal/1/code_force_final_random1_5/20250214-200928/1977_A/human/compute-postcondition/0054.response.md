Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split, `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The input for `n` and `m` comes from the first and second split of the input respectively.
