Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split, `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer from the split, `m` is assigned the value of the second input integer from the split.**

In this case, the code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The `n` and `m` variables now hold the values of the first and second integers from the input split, respectively.
