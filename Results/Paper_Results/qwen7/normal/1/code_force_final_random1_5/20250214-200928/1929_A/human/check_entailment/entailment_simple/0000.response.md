Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements (`a`).
3. It sorts the array `a`.
4. It calculates the maximum beauty of the array as the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array.
5. This approach is correct because the maximum beauty of the array can be achieved by arranging the elements such that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning, maximizing the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})`.

Given the problem description and the logic of the program, the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
