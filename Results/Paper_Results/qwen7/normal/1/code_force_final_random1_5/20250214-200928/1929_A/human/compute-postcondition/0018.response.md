Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ntest` is an input integer which represents the total number of times the loop has run. `itest` will be equal to `ntest - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `n` is an input integer representing the size of the list `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping `int` to each element of the input split by spaces. The final output of the loop will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements in each list `a` printed during the iterations.

In summary, `ntest` equals the total number of iterations, `itest` is `ntest - 1`, and for each `itest` from 0 to `ntest - 1`, there exists an `n` and a sorted list `a` of integers, with the output being the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`.
