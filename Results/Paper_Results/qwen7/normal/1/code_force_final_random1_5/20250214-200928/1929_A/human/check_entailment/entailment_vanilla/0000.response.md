### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end. This ensures that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the elements of the array.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It prints the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted array, which is essentially the maximum possible beauty of the array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the largest element is at the end and the smallest element is at the beginning.
   - The beauty calculation \((a_{\text{last}} - a_{\text{first}})\) is indeed the maximum possible beauty because any other arrangement would result in smaller differences between consecutive elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
