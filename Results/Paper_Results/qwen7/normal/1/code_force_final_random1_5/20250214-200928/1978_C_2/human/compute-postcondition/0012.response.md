Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing a valid permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of this permutation is equal to `k`. It prints "YES" followed by each element of the list `l` on the same line separated by spaces. After executing the loop, it prints a newline character. The function does not return any value.**
