Output State: **`c` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is `k - i + 1`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` by subtracting `i` from it and then adding 1. Here, `i` is `n - 5`, so `k` becomes `k - (n - 5) + 1`. The other variables (`c`, `n`, `l`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code. The conditions for the functions `func_2` and `func_3` remain as described in the initial state.
