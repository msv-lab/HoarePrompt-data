Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is \(n - 8\), `k` is \(n - 9\), the first element of list `l` is equal to the second last element of list `l`, the second last element of list `l` is the same as the first element, `x` is the last element of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of list `l` to variable `x`. Since the first element of list `l` is equal to the second last element, and the second last element is the same as the first element, the last element of the list remains unchanged. Therefore, `x` is the last element of list `l`. All other variables and their relationships remain the same as the initial state.
