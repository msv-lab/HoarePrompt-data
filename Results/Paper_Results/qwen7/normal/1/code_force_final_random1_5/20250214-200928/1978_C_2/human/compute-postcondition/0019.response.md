Postcondition: **`c` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 1) + 1`. If `k == 0`, the function returns a variable 'l', but since 'l' is not defined in the given code snippet or initial state, the postcondition remains unchanged. There is no else part in the code.**
