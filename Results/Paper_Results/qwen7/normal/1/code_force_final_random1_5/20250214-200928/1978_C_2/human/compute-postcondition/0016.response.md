Output State: **The program returns n and k, where n is an integer obtained from the first input split and k is an integer obtained from the second input split and is divisible by 2.**

This means that the program will return two values: `n`, which is an integer from the first input, and `k`, which is an integer from the second input and is guaranteed to be divisible by 2.
