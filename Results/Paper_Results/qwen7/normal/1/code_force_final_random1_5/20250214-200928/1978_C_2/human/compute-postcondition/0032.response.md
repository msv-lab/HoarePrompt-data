Postcondition: `c` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is `n - 5`, `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `l` is the result of `func_3(c, l)`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the function returns the result of `func_2(3, k, i)` where `k` is updated based on the value of `i` (which is `n - 5`), and `i` is `n - 5` with `n` being an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). If `k` is not less than `i - 1`, the function returns the result of `func_3(3, l)` where `l` is the value of `i` which is `n - 5`.
