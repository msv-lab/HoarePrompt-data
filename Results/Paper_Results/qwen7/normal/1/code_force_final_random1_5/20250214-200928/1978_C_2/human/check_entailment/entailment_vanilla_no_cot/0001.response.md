To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze each function step-by-step and verify if they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Function 1: `func_1(n, k)`
This function attempts to construct a permutation that satisfies the Manhattan value condition. Hereâ€™s how it works:
1. It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. It iteratively modifies this list to try and achieve the required Manhattan value.
3. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the current list `l`.
4. Otherwise, it moves the last element to a position that reduces `k` by the appropriate amount.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
This function checks if the given `k` is achievable for a permutation of length `n`:
1. It checks if `k` is even because the Manhattan value is always even.
2. It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
3. If `k` exceeds this maximum, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
4. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

### Function 3: `func_3(l)`
This function prints the permutation `l` if it exists:
1. It prints "YES".
2. It prints the elements of `l` separated by spaces.
3. It ends with a newline.

### Function 4: `func_4()`
This function orchestrates the process:
1. It calls `func_2()` to check if the problem is solvable.
2. If `n` is 0, it prints "NO".
3. Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print it.

### Analysis and Correctness Check
1. **Function 2**: This function correctly identifies if `k` is achievable for a given `n`. However, it has a minor issue where it returns `(0, 0)` instead of `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd. This should be corrected to `(0, 0)`.

2. **Function 1**: This function seems to have a logic flaw. It tries to reduce `k` by moving the last element to different positions, but it doesn't ensure that the final permutation meets the exact Manhattan value requirement. Specifically, it might not handle edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is very small or when the permutation needs specific adjustments.

3. **Function 3**: This function correctly prints the permutation if it exists.

4. **Function 4**: This function correctly integrates the other functions and handles the input/output format.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in `func_1`, particularly its handling of the Manhattan value calculation and ensuring the exact permutation, the overall program may not be fully correct. However, the core idea of checking feasibility and generating permutations is sound.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

The program needs refinement, especially in `func_1`, to ensure it correctly generates permutations that meet the exact Manhattan value requirement.
