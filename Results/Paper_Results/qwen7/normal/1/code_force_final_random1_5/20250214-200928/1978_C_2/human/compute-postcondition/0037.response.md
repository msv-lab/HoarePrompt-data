Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). Depending on the conditions and the calls to other functions, the function returns either the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is 1 or 2, or the result of `func_3(3, l)`, with `l` being either undefined or derived from `i` which is `n - 5`.**

This means the function `func_1` takes two integers `n` and `k` as input. Based on certain conditions and calls to other functions like `func_2` and `func_3`, it returns a specific value. The exact value depends on whether `l` is defined and its relationship with `i` (where `i` is `n - 5`).
