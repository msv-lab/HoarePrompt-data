Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. The function returns a list `l` based on the following cases:**

- If the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at index `-k`, then the function returns the list `l`.
- If the first element of the list `l` is `x`, then the function returns the list `l`.
- If the second last element of the list `l` is inserted at index `-k` and `k` is `n-1`, then the function returns the list `l`.
- If the first element of the list `l` is equal to the second last element, and the second last element is the same as the first element, then the function returns the list `l`.
- If the list `l` contains a single element `val`, then the function returns the list `l`.
