Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_4`**: This function checks if the given `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to construct a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. It uses a series of swaps to adjust the permutation until the desired Manhattan value is achieved. The function handles both even and odd lengths of the permutation.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function performs a specific swap in the list `l` to reduce the Manhattan value. It swaps the elements at positions `c` and `c - k`.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function swaps the elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`. This helps in constructing the permutation step by step.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints the permutation if it is valid and meets the required Manhattan value. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`, then `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally `func_5` to print the result.

Given the problem statement and the execution summaries, the functions collectively work to find a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists. The logic in each function is consistent with the problem requirements and the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
