Output State: **The program returns the list `l` which contains a single element `val`.**

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `i` is \(n - 8\)
- `k` is \(n - 8\)
- The first element of list `l` is `val`
- The list `l` has one element
- `l[-k]` is `x`

The code snippet `return l` simply returns the list `l`. Since the list `l` is defined to have only one element, which is `val`, the program returns the list containing `val`.
