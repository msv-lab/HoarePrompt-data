Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of `n` None values, `mex` is assigned the value `n`.**

The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
