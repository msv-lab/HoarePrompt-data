Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i - 2]`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is `i - 2` and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i - 2]`, these values remain unchanged except for the assignment to `res[i]`. Therefore, `res[i]` is now set to `mex - ar[i]`.
