Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i - 2] - ar[i]`, `res[i]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given the initial state where `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i - 2]` and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, the new value of `mex` becomes `mex - ar[i - 2] - ar[i]`. The value of `i` remains `i - 2`, and `res[i]` is not affected by this line of code.
