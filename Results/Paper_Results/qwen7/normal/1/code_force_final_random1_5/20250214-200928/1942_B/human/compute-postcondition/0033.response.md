Output State: **`mex' is equal to `mex - ar[i]'**, `res[i]' is equal to `mex - ar[i]'**, `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]'**.

Explanation: The code `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since the initial postcondition stated that `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` and `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, after executing the code, `mex` becomes `mex - ar[i]`. This also means that `res[i]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `mex - ar[i]`, which is now `mex - ar[i]`. The condition that `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]` still holds true.
