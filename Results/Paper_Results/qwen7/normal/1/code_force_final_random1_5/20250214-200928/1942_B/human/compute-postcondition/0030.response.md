Output State: **`res[i]' is equal to `mex - ar[i]'**.

Explanation: The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Here, `mex` and `ar[i]` are assumed to be previously defined variables. The value of `res[i]` is now determined by subtracting the value of `ar[i]` from `mex`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
