Output State: **`i` is -2; `res` is a list where the element at index -2 is `mex - ar[-2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `res` by setting the element at index `i` (which is -2) to the value of `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` is -2, the element at this index in `res` is now `mex - ar[-2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
