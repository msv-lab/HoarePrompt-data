Output State: **`i` is -2; `mex` is `mex - ar[-2]`; `res` is a list where the element at index -2 is `mex - ar[-2]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from `mex`. Given that `i` is -2, the value of `ar[i]` is `ar[-2]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[-2]`. The list `res` remains unchanged, and its element at index -2 is still `mex - ar[-2]`.
