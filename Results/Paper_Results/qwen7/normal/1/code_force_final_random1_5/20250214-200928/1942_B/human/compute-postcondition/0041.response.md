Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is -2
   - `mex` is `mex - ar[-2]`
   - `res` is a list where the element at index -2 is `mex - ar[-2]`
   - The condition for no change to `res` is if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from the current value of `-2` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches the start of the array (index 0).
   - Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be `-1`.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - We need to check if the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true for the new value of `i` (-1).
   - If the condition holds, `res` will remain unchanged.
   - If the condition does not hold, `res` will be updated.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be `-1`.
   - `mex` remains the same unless the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` fails.
   - `res` remains the same unless the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` fails.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is -1, `mex` is `mex - ar[-2]`, `res` is a list where the element at index -2 is `mex - ar[-2]`**
