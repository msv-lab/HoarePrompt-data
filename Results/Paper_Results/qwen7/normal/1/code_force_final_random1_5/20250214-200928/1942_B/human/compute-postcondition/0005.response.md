Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `len(ar)`, and the range function parameters.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `len(ar) - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the initial value of `i` must be `len(ar) - 1`.

3. **Determine the State of `len(ar)`**: The length of the list `ar` is a constant determined by the initial state of `ar`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` starts at `len(ar) - 1` and decreases, the loop will always execute if `len(ar)` is at least 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t`: This variable is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `n`: This variable is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `ar`: The length of `ar` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `res`: This variable is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `mex`: This variable is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `i`: The initial value of `i` must be `len(ar) - 1`.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the length of the list `ar`.

**State:**
**`ar` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is len(ar) - 1**
