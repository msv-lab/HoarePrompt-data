The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes a new list `res` of length `n` where each element is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, with `mex` being the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the elements of `res` separated by spaces.
