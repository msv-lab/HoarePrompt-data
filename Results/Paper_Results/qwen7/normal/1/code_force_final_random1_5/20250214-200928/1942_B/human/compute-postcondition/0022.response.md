Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will be reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`, and each element in `res` will be set to `mex - ar[i]` for the last valid `i` value.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order. For each iteration, it updates `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` and then decrements `mex` by `ar[i]`. Since the loop runs until `i` becomes `-1`, all elements in `res` are updated based on the final value of `mex`. After all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, and `mex` will be the initial value of `n` minus the sum of all elements in `ar`. Each element in `res` will hold the value calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for the last valid `i` value, which effectively means `mex - ar[-1]` since `i` becomes `-1` at the end.
