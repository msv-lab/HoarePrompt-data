Output State: `i` is `-1`, `mex` is `mex - len(ar)*ar[-1] + sum(ar)`, and `res[i+1:]` is `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(-1, len(ar)-1)]`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `-1` because the loop decrements `i` from `-len(ar)` to `-1`. The value of `mex` will be adjusted based on the operations performed within the loop, specifically `mex -= ar[i]` for each iteration, leading to `mex - len(ar)*ar[-1] + sum(ar)`. The list `res` will be updated such that `res[i+1:]` (from index `-1` to the end) will contain the values `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` in the range `-1` to `len(ar)-1`.
