Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
2. The program iterates backward through the array `a` to compute the values for `res` using the formula `res[i] = mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray `a[:i+1]`.
3. However, the logic to update `mex` is flawed. The current implementation simply sets `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` without ensuring that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
4. To correctly compute `mex`, we need to ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray `a[:i+1]`. This requires checking the presence of integers in the subarray, which is not done in the current implementation.
5. Additionally, the program should handle the case where `mex` might already be present in the subarray, which would require adjusting `mex` accordingly.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly compute the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
