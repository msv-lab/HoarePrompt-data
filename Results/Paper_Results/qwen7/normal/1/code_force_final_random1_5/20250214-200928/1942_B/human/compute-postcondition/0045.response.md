Postcondition: `i` is -1, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list where the element at index -2 is `mex - ar[-2]`, and the element at index -1 of `res` is `mex - ar[-1]`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then the condition is always true and no change is needed. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the if condition is met.
