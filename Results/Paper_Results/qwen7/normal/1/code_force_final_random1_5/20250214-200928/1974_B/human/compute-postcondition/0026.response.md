Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list containing unique characters from `s`, `j` is either decreased by 1 or increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1. If `char` is found in `unique_chars`, `s` is a modified version of the original string where every occurrence of `char` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]`. Otherwise, `unique_chars` is updated to include the character `char` at index `i`.
