Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not in `unique_chars`, and `unique_chars` contains the element `char` at index `i+1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `unique_chars` contained `char` at index `i`. After incrementing `i` by 1, `char` is now at index `i+1` in `unique_chars`. The values of `s` and `char` remain unchanged.
