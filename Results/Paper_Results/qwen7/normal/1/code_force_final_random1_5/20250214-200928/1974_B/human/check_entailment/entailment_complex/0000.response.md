Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode an encoded string back to its original form. However, there are several issues with the logic implemented in the `func_1` function that prevent it from correctly performing the decoding process.

1. **Incorrect Replacements**: The function tries to replace each character in the encoded string `s` with a character from the `unique_chars` list. This approach is flawed because it doesn't maintain the correct mapping between characters in the encoded string and the original string. Specifically, the function uses a simple replacement mechanism without considering the symmetric nature of the encoding process.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The function inserts new characters into `unique_chars` when it encounters a character not present in `unique_chars`. This is unnecessary and incorrect for decoding purposes. The goal is to map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string, not to modify the `unique_chars` list during the process.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a string composed of all unique characters from the final state of `s` in the order they appeared, which is not the intended output. The correct output should be the decoded string, not the list of unique characters.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
