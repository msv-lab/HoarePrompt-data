Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in the modified `s`. If `char` is found in `unique_chars`, `char` is replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1. If `char` is not found in `unique_chars`, `j` is increased by 1, `unique_chars` is updated to include `char`, and `i` is increased by 1.
