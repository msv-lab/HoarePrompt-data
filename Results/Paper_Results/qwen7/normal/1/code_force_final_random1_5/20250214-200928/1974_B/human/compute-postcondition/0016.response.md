Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list with one additional element which is `char`, variable `i` is increased by 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously part of the initial state with no specific value given, we only know that its value has been increased by 1. The values of `s`, `char`, and `unique_chars` remain unchanged from their initial states.
