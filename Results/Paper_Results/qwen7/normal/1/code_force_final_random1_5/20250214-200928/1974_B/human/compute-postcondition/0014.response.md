Output State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of `char` replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, `char` is the next character in the modified `s`; `j` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` is now one less than its previous value. The values of `s` and `char` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the executed line of code.
