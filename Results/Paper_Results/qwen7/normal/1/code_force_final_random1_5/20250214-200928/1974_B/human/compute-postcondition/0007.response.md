Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not in `unique_chars`, and `unique_chars` contains the element `char` at index `i`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars.insert(i, char)` inserts the character `char` into the list `unique_chars` at the specified index `i`. Since `char` was not previously in `unique_chars`, its insertion updates the list. The initial conditions that `s` is a non-empty string and `char` is not in `unique_chars` remain true, but now `char` is specifically located at index `i` in `unique_chars`.
