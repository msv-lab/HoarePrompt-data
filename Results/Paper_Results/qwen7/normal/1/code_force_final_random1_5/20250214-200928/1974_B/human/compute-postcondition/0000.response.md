Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a list of sorted unique characters from `s`.**

Explanation: The code creates a set of unique characters from the string `s` and then converts this set into a sorted list. The original string `s` remains unchanged, and the new variable `unique_chars` contains a sorted list of the unique characters found in `s`.
