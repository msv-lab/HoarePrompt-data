Output State: **`missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`; `results` is a list with one additional element `missing`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. Since `missing` is defined as the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `max(0, m - f)` for each `f` in `freq`, its value does not change. The only change is that `results` now contains an additional element, which is `missing`.
