Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`test_cases`).
2. The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate for the problem statement.
3. For each test case, the function calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq`.
4. It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
5. The function sums up the missing problems across all difficulty levels and appends this value to the `results` list.
6. Finally, it returns the list of results for each test case.

Given that the code follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles the examples provided correctly, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
