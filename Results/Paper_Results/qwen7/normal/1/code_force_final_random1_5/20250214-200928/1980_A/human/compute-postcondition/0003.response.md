Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is now 0, `n` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `m` is an integer from the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is a string from the first tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values from the first tuple in `test_cases` to `n`, `m`, and `a`. The value of `_` is set to 0, indicating that the first tuple was accessed. All other variables remain in their initial state.
