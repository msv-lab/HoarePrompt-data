### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Definition**: The program correctly defines the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`test_cases`). This part is handled appropriately.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate for the problem statement.
   - **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, the function calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq`. This step is correct and necessary.
   - **Determining Missing Problems**: The function determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. This step is also correct.
   - **Summing Up Missing Problems**: The function sums up the missing problems across all difficulty levels and appends this value to the `results` list. This step is correct.
   - **Returning Results**: The function returns the list of results for each test case. This step is correct.

3. **Examples Provided**:
   - The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. The outputs match the expected results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when there are no problems in the bank (`n=0`) and when the required number of rounds is less than or equal to the number of problems available (`m <= n`).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the examples provided.

Given that the code follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles the examples provided correctly, the program appears to be correct.
