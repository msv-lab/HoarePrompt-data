Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases as input.
2. For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the given string `a`.
3. It then calculates how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
4. The missing problems are summed up to get the total number of additional problems needed.
5. The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to the number of problems needed for each test case.
6. The provided test cases match the expected input format and the logic implemented in the function correctly computes the required output.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
