Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases as input.
2. For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
3. It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `freq` array.
4. Then, it calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by subtracting the current frequency from the required number of rounds `m` and taking the maximum of 0 and the result.
5. Finally, it sums up these missing values to get the total number of problems Vlad needs to create for that test case.
6. The program iterates through all test cases and appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
7. The function returns the list of results.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
