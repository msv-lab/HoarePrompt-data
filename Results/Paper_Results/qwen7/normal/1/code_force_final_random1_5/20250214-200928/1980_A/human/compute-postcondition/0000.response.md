Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', a function is defined to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.**

The given code snippet is a docstring for a function that calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create based on the input parameters. However, the actual implementation of the function is not provided in the code snippet, so the values of the variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The function definition itself does not alter the values of these variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state with the addition of the function definition.
