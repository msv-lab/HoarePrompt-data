### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Initialization**: The program initializes `t` and `test_cases` correctly, which matches the problem description.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle multiple test cases, which is appropriate.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using the list `freq`.
4. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The function correctly computes the number of missing problems for each difficulty level. Specifically, for each difficulty level, it checks if the current frequency is less than the required frequency (`m`). If so, it adds the difference to the `missing` variable.
5. **Summing Missing Problems**: The function sums up the missing problems for all difficulty levels and appends this value to the `results` list.
6. **Return Statement**: The function returns the list of results, which is correct.

However, there is a subtle issue with the way the function handles the test cases. The original assessment did not consider the possibility that the input `test_cases` might have more than 3 test cases, but the code only processes the first 3 test cases due to the hardcoded value of `t = 3`.

To ensure the program works correctly for any number of test cases within the specified range, the value of `t` should be dynamically read from the input rather than being hardcoded.

### Final Evaluation:

Given that the program only processes the first 3 test cases due to the hardcoded value of `t = 3`, it does not handle the general case where `t` can be any value between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

**Final: False**
