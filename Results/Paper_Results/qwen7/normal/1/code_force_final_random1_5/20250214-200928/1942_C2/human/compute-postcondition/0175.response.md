Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is `-1 - (i // 2)`, `sx` is `-2 + i + i`, `y < c` condition is not checked since `sx` is updated.**

Explanation: The value of `sx` is updated by adding `i` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `y < c` is not checked because the code only updates `sx`.
