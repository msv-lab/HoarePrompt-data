Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i` // 2, `y` is `-1 - (i // 2)`, `sx` is `-4 + i**.

Explanation: The code `c = i // 2` assigns the value of `i // 2` to `c`. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `sx`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `c` is updated to `i // 2`, while `i`, `x`, `y`, and `sx` retain their initial values.
