Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order `[min(n, x, y), middle_value(n, x, y), max(n, x, y)]`**.

Explanation: The code sorts the list `a` which contains the integers `[n, x, y]`. After sorting, `a` will contain these three integers in ascending order. The values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
