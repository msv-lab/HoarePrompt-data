Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, the first line of each test case contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    ans = x - 2
    st = set(a)
    a.sort()
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        if t1 not in st and t2 in st:
            ans += 1
    odd = []
    even = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[0] + n if i == x - 1 else a[i + 1]
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap > 1 and gap % 2 == 1:
            odd.append(gap)
        elif gap > 0 and gap % 2 == 0:
            even.append(gap)
    odd.sort()
    even.sort()
    for gap in odd:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    for gap in even:
        if y < gap // 2:
            ans += 2 * y
            y = 0
            break
        ans += gap
        y -= gap // 2
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The `odd` list remains unchanged, `y` is 0, and `ans` is the cumulative sum of all `gap` values processed according to the loop's logic minus the total amount subtracted from `y` (which is the sum of all `gap // 2` values) plus any additional increments due to the `break` condition when `y` becomes less than `gap // 2`. After all iterations, `even` will be an empty list since all its elements have been processed, and `y` will have been reduced to 0 through repeated subtraction of `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The `even` list is empty, `ans` is the sum of all elements in the original `even` list minus half of each element (integer division), and `y` is equal to the negative of the last element in the original `even` list divided by 2 (integer division).

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the `even` list will be empty because every element has been processed. For each iteration, the loop either adds the current `gap` to `ans` and decreases `y` by `gap // 2` or, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and sets `y` to 0 before breaking out of the loop. This process continues until the `even` list is exhausted. Therefore, `ans` accumulates the sum of all elements in the `even` list minus half of each element (integer division), and `y` ends up being the negative half of the last element in the original `even` list (integer division).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The list `even` is now empty, `ans` is the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of all elements in the original `even` list, and `y` is the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `gap // 2` for each element in the original `even` list.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `even` will be exhausted, `ans` will have accumulated the sum of all `gap` values from `even`, and `y` will have been reduced by half of each `gap` value from `even`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
