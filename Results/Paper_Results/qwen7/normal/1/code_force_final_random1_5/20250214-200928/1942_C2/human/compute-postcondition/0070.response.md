Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2, then the value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
