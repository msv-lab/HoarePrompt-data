Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` is 2
   - `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`
   - `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n` and is in set `st`
   - If `t1` is not in set `st` and `t2` is in set `st`, `ans` is updated to 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `x`, we need to update `i` to `i + 1` and check if `i < x` to determine if the loop should continue.
   - Given that `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `i = 3` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `ans` is not directly dependent on the loop head, so it remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it.
   - `t1` and `t2` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (which is now 3), but their values are not specified to change in the problem statement, so they remain the same unless the loop body updates them.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 2, `t1` is `(a[3] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[3] + 2) % n` and is in set `st`**.
