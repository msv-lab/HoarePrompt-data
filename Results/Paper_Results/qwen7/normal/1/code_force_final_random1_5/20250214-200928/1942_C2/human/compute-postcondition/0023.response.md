Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Since `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `tmp` will contain this calculated value. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `a` must have at least 2 elements is still valid.
