Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `even` is `[gap]`, `gap` is equal to `gap - (next_elem - a[i] - 1)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. This means that `even` now contains the value of `gap` in addition to whatever was already in the list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
