Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` (since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`).

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer such that it is at least `1` and less than `len(a)`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`.

4. **Check the New Value of `i`**: After incrementing `i` by `1`, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by `1`.
   - The postcondition for `i` in the next iteration will be that it is at least `1` and less than `len(a)`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2 (since it was 1 before and incremented by 1), and `i` must still be less than `len(a)`**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, and `i` must be less than `len(a)`**.
