Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 3, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `c` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `y` is explicitly given as -2.
   - `sx` is explicitly given as -1.
   - `cons` is defined as -2 or `n` - 2, whichever is smaller. However, `n` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `cons`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(cons)`.

Given the information:
- `cons` is either -2 or `n - 2`, whichever is smaller. Since `n` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `cons`.

Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is that `cons` is -2 or `n - 2`, whichever is smaller.

Output: **cons (where cons is -2 or n - 2, whichever is smaller)**
