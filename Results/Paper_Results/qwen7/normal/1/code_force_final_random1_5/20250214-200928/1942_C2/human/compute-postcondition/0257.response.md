Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(x)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is 1
   - `t1` is `(a[0] + 1) % n` and is not in set `st`
   - `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n` and is in set `st`

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The values of `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 1, `t1` is (a[0] + 1) % n and is not in set `st`, `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in set `st`**
