Output State: **`even` list is empty, `ans` is the sum of all elements in the original `even` list minus half of each element (integer division), `y` is equal to the negative of the last element in the original `even` list divided by 2 (integer division), `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This creates a new list `a` which contains the integers entered by the user. The initial values of `even`, `ans`, `y`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
