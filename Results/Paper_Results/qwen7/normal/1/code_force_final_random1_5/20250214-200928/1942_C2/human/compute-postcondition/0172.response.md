Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i` // 2, `y` is `-1 - (i // 2)`, `sx` is `-2 + i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
