Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is the sum of 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by exactly 2, plus 1, and the sum of `(a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(a[j+1] - a[j]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1`, without the total decrement of `y` which is the sum of `((a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1)` for each such pair, and the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and greater than `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`. If the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is met, `y` is decreased by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. If the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` is satisfied, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- The list `a` remains sorted and has at least 2 elements.
- The variable `i` is updated to `len(a) - 2`.
- The list `tmp` contains one element, which is half the difference between the first and last elements of `a` adjusted by `n`.
- The variable `ans` is updated based on the number of pairs of consecutive elements differing by exactly 2, the sum of half the differences for pairs satisfying the condition, and adjustments based on the value of `y`.
- The value of `y` is decremented if the specific condition is met.
