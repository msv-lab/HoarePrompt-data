Postcondition: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `even` is `[gap]`, `gap` is equal to `gap - (next_elem - a[i] - 1)`, if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, the conditions for `odd` and `even` lists remain unchanged and `gap` is updated accordingly.**
