Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is `feat[0]`
   - If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `array2` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

5. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.

6. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Since `n` is `feat[0]` and `i` is now 3, the loop will stop if `feat[0]` is less than or equal to 3. If `feat[0]` is greater than 3, the loop will continue.

7. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` will remain `feat[0]`.
   - `array2` will remain unchanged unless the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is met, but since we are adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we assume the condition is not met (or the value of `array2` remains unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` remains unchanged**.
