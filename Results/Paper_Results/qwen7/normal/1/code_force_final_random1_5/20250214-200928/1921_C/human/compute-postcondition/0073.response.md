Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constants `1` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
   - `arr` and `array2` are such that if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, if the loop was just completed with `i` being some value `k`, the next iteration will start with `i = k + 1`.
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` will be checked with `i = k + 1`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` will be evaluated with the updated `i`.

Given that the loop just finished its previous iteration with `i` being some value (let's call it `k`), the next iteration will start with `i = k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**State: **`arr` and `array2` are such that if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged, where `i` is now `k + 1`.**
