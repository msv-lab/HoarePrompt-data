Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `array2` is a list with one element which is `arr[0] * a`**

Explanation: The code snippet `array2.append(arr[0] * a)` appends the value of `arr[0] * a` to the list `array2`. However, since `arr` and `a` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the updated state includes `array2` as a list containing the product of `arr[0]` and `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
