Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers n, f, a, and b, and a list m of n integers. It then constructs a new list array2 based on specific conditions involving the differences between consecutive elements in m and the values of a and b. Finally, it compares the sum of array2 with the product of (n - length of array2) and b to f, printing 'Yes' if the sum is less than f, and 'No' otherwise.**
