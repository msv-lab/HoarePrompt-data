Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `feat`, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4 is still valid. The values of `i`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, and `a` remain the same as they were initially.
