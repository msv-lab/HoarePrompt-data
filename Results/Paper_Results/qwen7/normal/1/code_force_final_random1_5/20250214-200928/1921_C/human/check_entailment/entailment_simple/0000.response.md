### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.
   - This part correctly parses the input as specified.

2. **Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - It initializes an empty list `array2` to store the extra charge consumed due to turning off and on the phone.
   - For each interval between consecutive message times, it checks if the charge lost in that interval (`arr[i] - arr[i - 1] * a`) is less than the charge lost by turning off and on (`b`).
   - If the condition is met, it adds the charge lost during that interval to `array2`.
   - After processing all intervals, it calculates the total charge consumed by considering both the charge lost due to intervals and the charge lost due to turning off and on the phone.
   - Finally, it compares this total charge with the initial charge `f` to determine if it's feasible to send all messages.

3. **Output:**
   - If the total charge consumed is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly accounts for the charge consumed due to intervals and the charge consumed due to turning off and on the phone.
- The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` ensures that turning off and on the phone is more efficient than losing charge continuously.
- The summation and comparison steps are correctly implemented to determine if the total charge consumed is within the initial charge `f`.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
