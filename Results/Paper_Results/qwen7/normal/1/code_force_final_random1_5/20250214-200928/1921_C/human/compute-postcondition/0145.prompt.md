Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an integer input value between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n-1`, which is the total number of elements in `arr` minus one. The value of `n` will be the same as the length of `arr`. `array2` will contain elements appended based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0`, `array2` will append `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`. For other indices, `array2` will append `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` is less than `b / a`. Otherwise, no new elements are appended to `array2` for that iteration. The sum of `array2` plus the product of the remaining elements in `arr` (from `i+1` to `n-1`) and `b` is less than `f` if the if condition is true, and the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f` if the else condition is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is the first element of `feat`. `array2` contains elements based on the specified conditions. After executing the if-else block, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` will be either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final state of `array2` will contain elements based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the condition holds. Otherwise, if the sum is greater than or equal to `f`, the condition still holds and `array2` contains elements based on the conditions met during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
