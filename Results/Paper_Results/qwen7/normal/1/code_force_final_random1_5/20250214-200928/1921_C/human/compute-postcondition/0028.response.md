Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is equal to `n`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for every `i` in the range from 2 to `n`, and the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a\) holds true for each of these elements, and the sum of `array2` plus \((n - len(array2)) * b\) is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f` depending on the condition inside the if else block.**
