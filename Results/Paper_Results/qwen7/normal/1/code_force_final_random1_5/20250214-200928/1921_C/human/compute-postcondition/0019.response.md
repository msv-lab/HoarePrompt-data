Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is initially 4, the expression evaluates to `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. After this operation, `i` is decremented by 1 (to 3) because array indexing typically starts from 0. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\) and that `n` must be greater than 4 remains unchanged.
