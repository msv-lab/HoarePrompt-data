Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `feat[1]`, `n` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is an empty list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

The code initializes an empty list `array2`. No changes are made to the values of the other variables, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
