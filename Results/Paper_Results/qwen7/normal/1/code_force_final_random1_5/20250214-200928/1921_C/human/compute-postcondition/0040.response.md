Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `feat[0]`, `array2` contains `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`, the value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Initially, `i` is 1, so now `i` is incremented to 2. The value of `n` remains `feat[0]` because it is not affected by the code. The condition that `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a` is still valid.
