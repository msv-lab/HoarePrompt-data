Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`, and the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is still true.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing the line `i` becomes 2. The value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is calculated using the current values of `i`, `arr`, and `a`, and appended to `array2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
