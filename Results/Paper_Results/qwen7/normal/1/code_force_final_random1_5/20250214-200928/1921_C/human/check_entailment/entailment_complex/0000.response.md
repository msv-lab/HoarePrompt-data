Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the necessary parameters \(n\), \(f\), \(a\), and \(b\).
3. It then constructs the array `arr` from the list of message times.
4. The array `array2` is constructed by calculating \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) \times a\) for each index \(i\) where the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < \frac{b}{a}\) is satisfied. This step ensures that we only consider the times where turning off and on the phone would consume less charge than losing charge continuously.
5. The program then checks if the total charge consumed by sending messages and turning the phone off and on is less than the initial charge \(f\). This is done by summing the elements of `array2` and adding \((n - \text{len}(array2)) \times b\).
6. The logic for determining whether Stepan can send all messages is correct. The program prints 'Yes' if the calculated charge is sufficient and 'No' otherwise.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
