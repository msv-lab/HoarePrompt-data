Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers. `array2` is a list of integers where:
- If the first element of `arr` is less than the result of `b` divided by `a`, then `array2` contains the value of the first element of `arr` multiplied by `a`.
- If the difference between the first element of `arr` and the element just before the first element (considered as 0) is less than `b/a`, then `array2` contains the value `(arr[0] - 0) * a`.
- Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
