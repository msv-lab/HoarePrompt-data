Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, and if `arr[4] - arr[3] < b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. If the condition `arr[4] - arr[3] >= b / a` holds, `array2` remains unchanged.
