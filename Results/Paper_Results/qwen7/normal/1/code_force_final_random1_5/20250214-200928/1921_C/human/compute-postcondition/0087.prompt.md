Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an integer input, within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `i` is equal to `n`, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for every `i` in the range from 2 to `n`, and the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a\) holds true for each of these elements, and the sum of `array2` plus \((n - len(array2)) * b\) is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f` depending on the condition inside the if else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` contains elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] < b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`. Additionally, if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the sum remains as calculated. Otherwise, `array2` includes elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] >= b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as an array of integers, `array2` contains all the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is satisfied. The sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`, depending on the outcome of the if condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
