You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program:
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        array2 = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), two additional integers \( f \) and \( a \), and an array of \( n \) integers \( m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n \). For each test case, it calculates a new array \( array2 \) containing values \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) \times a\) for indices \( i \) where \( arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < \frac{b}{a} \). After constructing \( array2 \), it checks if the sum of its elements plus \((n - \text{len}(array2)) \times b\) is less than \( f \). If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the necessary parameters and the list of message times.

2. **Calculating Energy Consumption:**
   - The program calculates the energy required to send each message without turning off the phone.
   - For each pair of consecutive message times, it checks if the difference between them is less than `b/a`. If it is, it means turning off the phone would save more energy than using it continuously.
   - It stores these differences in `array2`.

3. **Summing Up Energy Consumption:**
   - The program sums up the energy consumed by sending messages without turning off the phone (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
   - It also sums up the energy saved by turning off the phone at appropriate times (`sum(array2)`).

4. **Comparing Total Energy with Initial Charge:**
   - The program checks if the total energy consumed is less than the initial charge `f`.
   - If the total energy is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues in the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Energy Savings:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the energy savings by assuming that turning off and on the phone at every opportunity where the time difference is less than `b/a` is optimal.
   - This approach might not always yield the minimum energy consumption because the program does not consider the optimal sequence of turning off and on the phone.

2. **Logical Error in Energy Calculation:**
   - The program should calculate the energy consumption more accurately by considering the optimal sequence of turning off and on the phone.
   - The current implementation assumes that turning off and on at every opportunity is the best strategy, which is not necessarily true.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the logical errors in calculating the energy consumption and the suboptimal strategy for turning off and on the phone.
