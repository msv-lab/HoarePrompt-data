Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is 1; `array2` contains an element which is equal to `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` an element calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given `i` is 2, the expression inside the parentheses becomes `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Since `n` remains unchanged and `i` also remains unchanged, the updated states of the variables are as described.
