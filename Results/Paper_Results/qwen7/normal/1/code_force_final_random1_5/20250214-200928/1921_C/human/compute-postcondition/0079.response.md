Postcondition: **`arr` and `array2` are such that if `arr[i + 2] - arr[i + 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[i + 2] - arr[i + 1]) * a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged; in either case, `array2` has an additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` appended to it.**
