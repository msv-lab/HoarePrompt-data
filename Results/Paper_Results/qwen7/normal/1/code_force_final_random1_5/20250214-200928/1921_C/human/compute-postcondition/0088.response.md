Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `arr` remains unchanged as an array of integers. `array2` contains all the elements \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a\) is satisfied. The final output will be 'Yes' if the sum of elements in `array2` plus \((n - len(array2)) * b\) is less than `f`, and 'No' otherwise. All other variables retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being equal to `test_cases - 1`.
