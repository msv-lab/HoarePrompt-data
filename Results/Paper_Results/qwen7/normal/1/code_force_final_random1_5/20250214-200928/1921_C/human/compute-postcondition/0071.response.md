Output State: **The current value of `arr` remains the same; `array2` has appended the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) to the list `array2`. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition about the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` being less than `b / a` is also preserved.
