Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `t` is `t - 1`, but since `t` is not used in the print statement, it does not affect the output.

The print statement is `print(k // 2 + 1)`. 

Given that `k` is an integer input from the user, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will compute the integer division of `k` by 2 and then add 1 to the result. The integer division `k // 2` means that any fractional part resulting from the division is discarded, and then 1 is added to the quotient.

Therefore, the output will be the result of `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the integer input from the user)**
