Postcondition: **`s` is the next valid line of input starting from the second line; `n` is the integer value of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer; `k` is the integer value of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, no change is made to the variables. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, no change is made to the variables. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
