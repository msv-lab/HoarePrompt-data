Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `t` is reduced by 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is `print(k // 2 + 1)`. Here, `k` is an integer input from the user, and the expression `k // 2 + 1` calculates the integer division of `k` by 2 and then adds 1 to the result.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the integer input from the user)**
