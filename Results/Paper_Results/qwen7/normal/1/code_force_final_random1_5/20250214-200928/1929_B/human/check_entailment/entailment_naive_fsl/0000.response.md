Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to calculate the minimum number of cells needed to color when \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 2 \) but more than half of the diagonals. For example, consider the test case \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 5 \). According to the problem statement, we need to color enough cells so that at least 5 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program incorrectly calculates the result as \( \lceil 5 / 2 \rceil = 3 \), but the correct answer should be 2, as shown in the example where coloring 2 cells can achieve the requirement.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the specific conditions where \( k \) is close to \( 4n - 2 \) and ensure it calculates the minimum number of cells correctly.
