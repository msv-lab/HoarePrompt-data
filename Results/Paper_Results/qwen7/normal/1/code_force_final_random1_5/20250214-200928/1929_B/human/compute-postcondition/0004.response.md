Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
   - `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
   - The current value of `k` is 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2. This means \( k = 4n - 2 \).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(k // 2 + 1)
   ```

Given the relationship between `k` and `n`, we can express `k` as:
\[ k = 4n - 2 \]

When we substitute this into the print statement:
\[ \text{print}(k // 2 + 1) \]
\[ \text{print}((4n - 2) // 2 + 1) \]
\[ \text{print}(2n - 1 + 1) \]
\[ \text{print}(2n) \]

So, the print statement will output twice the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2n (where n is the integer input from the user)**
