Output State: The loop will continue to process each line of input until there are no more lines left. For each line, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically:

- If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, no changes are made to `n` and `k`.
- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, `k` is set to `4 * n - 3`.
- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, `k` is set to `4 * n - 2`.

After processing all lines of input, the final values of `n` and `k` for the last line processed will be printed according to the conditions in the loop body. All other variables and their states will remain as they were in the initial state, with no changes made outside of the loop body.
