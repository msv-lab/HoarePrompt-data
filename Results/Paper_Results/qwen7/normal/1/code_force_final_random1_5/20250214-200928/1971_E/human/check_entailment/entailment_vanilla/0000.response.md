Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` as expected.
   - It then reads the positions `a` and times `b` for `k` known points.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and stores them in `ad`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the differences in times between consecutive points in `b` and stores them in `bd`.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The program computes the speed between each pair of consecutive points using the formula \( v = \frac{ad[i]}{bd[i]} \).
   - This part is correct as it computes the speed accurately for each segment.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried point `ql` lies.
   - If the queried point exactly matches a known point, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the previously computed speeds and distances.
   - The calculation \( m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s] \) is correct for determining the additional time needed to travel from the previous known point to the queried point.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the time for each query as required.

### Edge Cases and Considerations

- **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the boundary conditions correctly by checking if the queried point exactly matches a known point.
- **Speed Calculation**: The speed calculation is done correctly for each segment.
- **Binary Search Usage**: The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the correct segment quickly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and handles the problem requirements correctly. There are no apparent errors in the implementation.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
