Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(b) - 1`, `i` is equal to `len(b)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `b`, because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `len(b) - 1`. During each iteration, the loop appends the difference `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Therefore, `bd` will contain `len(b) - 1` elements, starting with 0 and ending with `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
