Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b` for each test case. It initializes the necessary lists and variables correctly.

2. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed between each pair of points correctly by dividing the difference in positions (`ad`) by the difference in times (`bd`). This step is crucial for determining the speed between each segment.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in which the queried point lies. It then calculates the exact time taken to reach the queried point using the speed calculated earlier. The calculation is done by scaling the time difference based on the distance to the queried point.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the queried point exactly matches one of the known points. In such cases, it directly outputs the corresponding time without further calculations.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the output correctly, printing the time for each query as an integer, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

6. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates through all test cases and processes all queries for each test case correctly. The state of the program after processing all queries for a test case is consistent with the expected behavior.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem specification accurately and handles all aspects of the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
