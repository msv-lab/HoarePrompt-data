Output State: **`ad` is a list with one additional element which is the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and `a` and `i` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. This means that `ad` now contains one more element, which is the result of `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
