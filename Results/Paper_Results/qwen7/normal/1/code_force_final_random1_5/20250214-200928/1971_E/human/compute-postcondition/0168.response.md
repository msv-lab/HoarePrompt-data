Output State: **`i` is 4; `bd` is a list with three elements, where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]`, the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`, and the third element is `b[4] - b[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 4, the new element added to `bd` is `b[4] - b[3]`. The initial elements of `bd` remain unchanged, so the updated list `bd` now has three elements: the first element is `b[1] - b[0]`, the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`, and the third element is `b[4] - b[3]`. The value of `i` remains 4.
