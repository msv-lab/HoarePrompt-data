Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are `0`, `b[1] - b[0]`, and the fourth element is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is 4, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 4, the new element added to `bd` is `b[4] - b[3]`. Since `bd` originally had three elements (0, `b[1] - b[0]`, and `b[2] - b[1]`), after appending `b[4] - b[3]`, `bd` now contains four elements: 0, `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, and `b[4] - b[3]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
