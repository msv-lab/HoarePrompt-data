Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `v` will contain `len(a) - 1` elements, each being the result of dividing `ad[i]` by `bd[i]` for `i` ranging from 1 to `len(a) - 1`. The variable `i` will be set to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.

In more detail, if `len(a)` is, for example, 6 (meaning there are 5 divisions to perform), then `v` will end up as `[ad[1]/bd[1], ad[2]/bd[2], ad[3]/bd[3], ad[4]/bd[4], ad[5]/bd[5]]`. The value of `i` will be 6, reflecting that the loop has executed `len(a) - 1` times.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is increased by `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `m` is now `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in the sorted list `a`, `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer - a[s - 1], `l` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer - `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
